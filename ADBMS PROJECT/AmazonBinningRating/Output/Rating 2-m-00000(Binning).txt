Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours.

Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me.

1017,B001E6KBSK,A3UZ3WQO1TQ99W,4/27/11,7,10,2,Nothing like actual Muesli,"On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it.  Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them."

If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions.

And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc."

Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'"

Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.

In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.

Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.

1796,B001RVFDOO,A206FFH5DBWL1H,5/27/12,0,1,2,Not impressed,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!""."

The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!

The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on."
1826,B001RVFDOO,AJNJNA093JUW0,4/16/11,2,5,2,Popchips vs Baked Lays? Baked Lays taste MUCH better.,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )"

I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot)."

I keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid - but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure. I would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top (not the side)."
1924,B0016PKA1C,A2XXD7R9EOE6S1,3/9/11,1,1,2,"Works, but hard to open...Buy larger version instead of pod","Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half)."
1925,B0016PKA1C,A314KQRCVYGBO,1/18/11,1,1,2,"Sorry Oprah, not one of my 'favorite things'","Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! I've gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!"

The clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off, especially when the pod is filled with water. It's also difficult to get the cover on, especially when you're trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro. The o-ring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod doesn't seem to seat correctly. After removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs, I've never again been able to get it to be water-tight. Consequently, every time I use my pod,I have to store it in a bowl or else I'm mopping up water from my fridge shelf. On the plus side, the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day!"

That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question."

My review is not 2 stars instead of three.<br /><br />First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?"

The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!"

Don't get me wrong, if the price is right then I have no problem, but the price was a little misleading.  I was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box, not a warehouse box.  It looks like a mix and match of K Cups that fell out of other packages or were returned. Buyer beware."

I subscribe it once a month. Now there is 4 cans not open. The idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great, but there is no taste for this cheese snack. There is no cheese flavor in the puff. My son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me. My son love Happybaby's yogurt melts, beef stew, happy baby banana beet blueberry and Spinach, Mango and Pear.

However, the ingredients may not look so good.  It's important to shop around if you're going to use a lactose-free formula. Lactose-free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids.<br /><br />From Wikipedia: ""Baby colic (also known as infant colic, three-month colic, infantile colic and colic) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason."" You'll know it if it happens to your baby, and it's awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby.  It contains DHA, ARA and iron, but all baby formulas do because it is required by law.<br /><br />Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, I'm told by the company's public relations representative.  So much food in the U.S. is prepared with corn syrup solids, so that shouldn't be a worry, I'm told.  Ok, but I notice the obesity rate is high."

What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.<br /><br />(4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.<br /><br />(5) It is very much over-priced at $29.99."

This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars."

It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"".<br /><br />To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.<br /><br />And as a ""thirst quencher"", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade.

First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.<br /><br />The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?<br /><br />But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability."

I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie.

I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love.

Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.<br /><br />And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.<br /><br />First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.<br /><br />Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.<br /><br />Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.<br /><br />So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.

If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself."

3295,B005K4Q1VI,A3LXOMANBRFQJG,2/15/12,0,0,2,Too watery after multiple settings.,"A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more."

I bought this based on it NOT saying it was ""diet"" or ""low calorie"".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.<br /><br />Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products."

3353,B005K4Q1VI,ACOJICZG9EYPR,1/15/12,0,0,2,Funny taste?,I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again.

I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug.<br /><br />From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!"
3394,B005K4Q1VI,AF3ZIGIYXZUMH,12/13/11,0,0,2,You get what you paid for,"Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing."
3407,B005K4Q1VI,A2M4TSFND0HXIG,11/29/11,0,0,2,Not Good,"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.

I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK"">Splenda</a>"" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this."

3421,B005K4Q1VI,AWJXWD0EMKIUV,12/29/11,4,4,2,"Too sweet, too weak","Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people."
3450,B005K4Q1VI,A3CAZVZTJ411SB,1/4/12,0,1,2,Not Good,"I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct ""plasticy"" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way."
3451,B005K4Q1VI,AZE0XC66FVSDE,1/1/12,0,1,2,SoSo,This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.

I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(

The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.

It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.<br /><br />Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.<br /><br />I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.<br /><br />This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.<br /><br />BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.<br /><br />*For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor.

Apparently, the firmware is not compatible with Windows 7; it's supposedly been corrected in newer runs, but there's no way to tell if the one you're purchasing is newer or not.  I tried contacting Blue, twice, hoping to get a firmware update, or check into exchanging it, but never got a response from both attempts, so I finally just had to return it."

Very noisy.  Lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices.  Considering the decent reviews by others, I may just have a defective unit.  Either way... it's going back in the mail today."
4186,B004391DK0,AAD0HZLJHL3BI,2/14/12,0,0,2,A bit disappointing,"I was hoping Bisquick got it right when they released this product, but they missed their mark.<br /><br />I made both biscuits and dumplings (chicken & Dumplings). The biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. The dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two."
4199,B004391DK0,A2ZF94UWLGBLX8,12/8/11,0,0,2,Not for Pancakes,"I love pancakes, so giving up gluten was hard for me.  I've used Bisquick for pancakes for years with great results.  Alas, the best I got from the Gluten-Free version was edible, but not enjoyable.  It tasted a lot like pillow foam, not in a good way.  I will probably keep the mix for breading things, but not for pancakes.  I've found much better options."
4259,B004391DK0,AIDT99OP1GJVX,12/2/10,18,21,2,Way too sweet...,"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.<br /><br />That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing."
4260,B004391DK0,A3AATF9L2UGZ2K,10/11/10,25,31,2,Not impressed.,I was so excited to get this and try it.  Unfortunately I'm not impressed.<br /><br />For starters the value is terrible.  You get 3 cups of mix per box.  That's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever).  For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.  The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do.<br /><br />The pro's?<br />The biscuits did puff up nicely.  That's the only pro I have.

I followed the pancake recipe on the back.  As a person with celiac who has tried many things, I knew when I saw the fine, crystalline mix it wasn't going to be good.  The batter is pasty looking.  The pancakes were too dense and slightly off.  The end product was pretty bland.  You will be much better off with Pamela's mix.  Pamela's can be served to a gluten eater; I cannot say the same for this product."
4282,B004391DK0,ALDT4Z7SZY2GQ,11/7/11,1,2,2,Gritty - for no reason,"The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?).

4297,B004391DK0,A16JQ47D4O5EVN,5/17/11,1,3,2,Disappointed - This is gluten free BUT NOT dairy free,"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option."

I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful.. I'm so glad I've got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry!"

So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour."

Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I briefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3/4"" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2"" thick, with most closer to 1/4"".<br /><br />What difference does it make?<br /><br />Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4"" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!<br /><br />Will not order again from this supplier."

In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after I got home, I discovered why.

It wasn't a good bitter taste, it was a ""cringe"" kind of taste.<br /><br />I drink one of the strongest coffee's out there and this was too much for me. The strange taste of it turned me off...<br />I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn't impressed with that either.<br /><br />Maybe i'm just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.<br /><br />It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.<br /><br />No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that's steep. And I surely won't buy this in the future.<br /><br />You can go down to the local ""name of popular coffee shop here"" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.<br /><br />Melitta makes it sound like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europe's charming sidewalk cafe's, top quality hand- picked beans..<br /><br />If you want to pay this kind of money and like Melitta coffee, then get it, but I don't think it's anything special."

Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.<br /><br />I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store."

It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this ""roasted"" flavor."

Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins)."

Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again.

Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole ""greenwashing"" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it."

5365,B000G671RI,A3C99YBIB3V2K7,10/4/11,9,9,2,A poor choice,"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way."

Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!<br /><br />The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up)."
5394,B00622CYVS,A8PP8NPRJSAKO,1/11/12,2,2,2,Not a fan of BPA in baby food jar lids,"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)"

With each order there is always another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor.

It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?

The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.<br /><br />By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings.

I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first."

This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out.

The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.<br /><br />I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.<br /><br />Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt."

Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan."

This is going to be a short review for me, because I don't really have much else to say. I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.<br /><br />I know this isn't an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can't reconcile the taste with the ingredients.

However, I found it to be pretty ordinary.<br /><br />First the good stuff: It is 100% Orange & Tangerine juice, has no sweetners, is 100% natural, has 100% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, and has a nice carbonation tang to it.  If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley.<br /><br />However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd.  I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe.  You know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat NOW because by tomorrow you'll need to put out for the birds?  Not exactly something that I'd look forward to drinking.<br /><br />So for me, although this was somewhat good, its not exactly something I would get again.

While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.<br /><br />The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.<br /><br />Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.<br /><br />Not recommended, sorry."

The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can"

It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).<br /><br />The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to ""spend"" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.

I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me.
6748,B001LG945O,AKA48TRLD0REK,3/4/09,0,0,2,Did not deliver on the hype,"This product advertises that it is a soda made from 100% fruit juices and is refreshing.  I was quite disapointed in the flavor. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.<br /><br />This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version."
6750,B001LG945O,A16WPA6JV83YXT,3/3/09,0,0,2,Not as tasty as it could be,My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didn't care for it. The orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd.  I like the fact that has added Vitamin C and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking.
6753,B001LG945O,A1VV72295OP6B4,3/2/09,0,0,2,"Pricey sugar, okay taste","I wasn't sure what to expect with this citrusy, fizzy drink. It was okay, though not something I'd buy often, and certainly not worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />It wasn't as orangey as I expected and it wasn't until I had half of it gone that I read the ingredient list and saw why--orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list, with apple and grape juice first and second, and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list.<br /><br />When you look at the nutrition information, this product has about forty more calories than Coke Classic, and despite not having any *added* sugar, the grams of sugar in this product is MORE than an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola!! The only bonus of this over ""real"" soda is the Vitamin C and A...there isn't much else nutritionally to speak of."

The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM"">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a><br />3.

Well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone.  The carbonation is definitely light and does not last.<br /><br />As far as the taste goes I did not care for the taste at all. It left a bad after taste in my mouth I cannot recommend this product. I will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost.<br /><br />To be fair I gave it two stars because my wife thought it was OK.

The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, it's clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  I've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If you're looking for an orangey soda, try Izze's Sparking Clementine instead."

Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange-tangerine flavor -- followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.<br /><br />Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda."

If you've ever had a glass of Kool-Aid or Crystal Light, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />So there's that 'from powder' taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.<br /><br />I did not like it."
6808,B001LG945O,A1AHHYZZVWML3Z,2/24/09,0,0,2,Not good enough for me to make The Switch,"This 100% juice, carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda. As a somewhat health-conscious consumer, I avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as much as possible. This beverage contains no HFCS, no added sugar, no preservatives, and no added color. I'm sampling the orange flavor. It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day. The downside is a single 8.3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda.<br /><br />The Orange-Tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of Orangina. Perhaps you've tried Crystal Geyser's Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. It's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color.<br /><br />This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products. If I want orange juice or crave soda, I'll rather drink the real thing."
6814,B001LG945O,A2SH6A32BE6NEV,2/23/09,0,0,2,"Decent tasting, but too small and overpriced","I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money."
6816,B001LG945O,AKCZIJ6ZHE41D,2/23/09,0,0,2,Not So Bold Soda Alternative,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.<br /><br />Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.<br /><br />And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.<br /><br />That's great.<br /><br />So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.<br /><br />Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.<br /><br />But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).<br /><br />On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.<br /><br />Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas."

If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix."
6828,B001LG945O,A2Y8IDC1FKGNJC,3/4/10,1,1,2,Would Not Switch,"This had a nice citrus flavor, but it was too sweet and actually flat. I did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle. For the amount of sugar and calories, I rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water - less calories and more satisfying in my mouth. I got this on GB special for about $13.52 for the case. I don't think I will purchase again."
6835,B001LG945O,A1VYFEJM12ZP11,6/27/09,1,1,2,"Very harsh, too-sweet flavor.","I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.<br /><br />I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim ""no additional sugar"" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams."
6837,B001LG945O,AQCS89BWQDFSQ,6/26/09,1,1,2,Well it's better than the black cherry anyway,"This is my second can of ""The Switch"" that I'm reviewing under the Amazon Vine program. And while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues -- it's over priced at almost $1 for a mere 8.3oz can in a 24 pack, but more importantly it really just doesn't taste like orange or tangerine at all. The ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type. Now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink? Now don't get me wrong, it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste...but the flavor isn't all that appealing.<br /><br />I love orange juice, drink it every day. I'd love to try carbonated orange juice...but this is far from that. It MIGHT be a good substitute for normal soda for kids, but I can't imagine any other real reason to get this."
6842,B001LG945O,A3MRZSEI65B27,6/24/09,1,2,2,Medicine-like after taste,"I suspect this drink is an acquired taste. After the first sip, I was reluctant to take another. The second sip was an improvement and the third even more so. By the end of the can, I was finding it fairly enjoyable.<br /><br />It was only after I had finished that I noted the Alka Seltzer-like aftermath. Yuck.<br /><br />Still, I am sure I could get used to it after a few more tries. This is, I think, the problem with the drink: I would drink it because it presents itself as being good for me, not because I was blown away with taste or a feeling of refreshment.<br /><br />I would not buy it again."
6854,B001LG945O,A27UE9HJRZ22YI,6/23/09,2,4,2,"I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed","Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor."
6861,B001LG945O,A374MNR8XKAC5E,8/4/09,0,1,2,Too sweet!,"I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' Crush. That would be a NO. Of course, tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it's that much sweeter. Adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy, ultra sweet drink, not unlike cough syrup. Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty."
6872,B001LG945O,AI5OS4RQQIUMJ,6/25/09,0,1,2,Tastes like chemicals,"Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're die-hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If you're a die-hard juice drinker, stick to juice. If you want fizzy juice, add a little seltzer to your fruit juice."
6885,B001LG945O,A1HBI9BBQIG1NH,2/24/09,0,1,2,small size and mediocre taste,"8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. I'm not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus."
6896,B001LG945O,A3GYY4CBRUZRSO,6/25/09,1,1,2,No.,"I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda I've ever had.  Maybe that's deliberate; maybe they're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more ""natural"" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special."
6898,B001LG945O,A3SDEQCEKNED4O,6/24/09,1,1,2,Didn't Taste Great!,"The only good thing was that it was not sweet, but the taste was just bad. I could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink.  I have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks, and I have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks.  I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice."
6900,B001LG945O,A2HHAV29CZ1OIE,6/24/09,1,1,2,"Too much sugar, too expensive","The Switch Orange Tangerine sounded delicious when I ordered it. I thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days. And it would be if the taste were better. Perhaps the other flavors might be better but the orange tangerine had a bad aftertaste. Stick with the real juice if you want that flavor. The sparkling juice idea is good, I liked the carbonation as it was refreshing.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is the sugar. There was 34g of sugar in that little 8 oz. can. There is 40g in a 12 oz. can of Dr. Pepper. Way too much sugar.<br /><br />The other drawback for me is the price. I wouldn't buy it because it works out to be almost a dollar a can. If I'm going to pay that much, I would rather buy the regular juice (real, not reconstituted) in the store."
6904,B001LG945O,A206U97FPE48UV,6/23/09,1,1,2,"Questionable ""healthy"" drink...","Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.<br /><br />Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract."
6906,B001LG945O,A57H497OM1IJN,6/23/09,1,1,2,To much and not enough...,"The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a ""healthy"" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I'll pass."
6907,B001LG945O,AOODNGLAEDN76,6/22/09,1,1,2,Strange...,"On the face of it, THE SWITCH Orange Tangerine beverage sounds quite good. It's a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water. No added sugar, preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health-conscious. You get 140 calories from one 8.3 ounce can. (Probably too small a serving for most people.) There are small portions of natural flavor and coloring, gum acacia, ascorbic acid (i.e., Vitamin C) and soy. In case quantities, it's priced at under a dollar per can. Sounds pretty decent, right?<br /><br />The trouble is: it just doesn't taste that good to me. There is a vaguely unpleasant metallic quality to this stuff that I can't imagine many people warming up to. Perhaps the juice has reacted with the aluminum of the can. Perhaps my can had been sitting on the shelf for too long. Perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste; it's something I haven't tried before. Perhaps I got a bum can. Perhaps THE SWITCH just plain sucks. I really don't know, but I do know that I won't be drinking any more of it in the near future."

I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.<br /><br />For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.<br /><br />Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans."
6913,B001LG945O,A1SINHLUYMCCRK,2/28/09,1,1,2,A Muddy Orange Flavor,"While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you."

It appears that the use of 100% juice in this product makes a big difference from the Izze's use of 70% juice/30% sparkling water.  I like Izze, but do not like Switch much.<br /><br />Switch tastes -- and is -- just like orange juice, except it is carbonated.  I do not think orange juice was meant to be carbonated.  It just doesn't add anything to the taste or consistency that I found enjoyable.  It also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which I did not enjoy.  So it is not that the makes have done anything wrong or poor quality, it is just that this reviewer did not like how the concept worked out."

Add to that this fizzy aspect, and its just kinda, well, there.<br /><br />I can't say that this is a healthy drink - orange juice has some of the highest concentrations of sugars for a fruit drink.  And its cost per can is steep, especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice.<br /><br />I can't give it one star - I would reserve that for something undrinkable as Amazon requires a minimum one star to do a review.

I liked the Kiwi Strawberry quite well (better than some other reviewers did, it seems), so I was sure I would enjoy this one just as much.<br /><br />The initial taste of this Orange Tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart, and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart.  The aftertaste is rather pleasant, so if the aftertaste is what you're looking for in a drink, this is the drink for you.  My wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne, if that's any indication of what to expect from this drink.<br /><br />The flavor is different, and not at all what I expected.

I finally found it on my doorstep.<br /><br />Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly. However the bit of overhanging filter was soaked, dripping, and HOT! I had discovered the source of the leak. I have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem. I guess I should have bought the EcoBrew cup after all.<br /><br />If you like the appearance of convenience, and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you.<br /><br />(I went ahead and gave it two stars because I like the idea of the product so much.)"

This last shipment, either the lids are slightly larger or the cups are smaller. The lids are extremely hard to get on. If I press too hard the cup starts to buckle.

The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing!"

Each cup I get coffee grounds in and not a whole cup of coffee.. Great concept, I believe the paper filter is to fine which holds back the coffee and pressure which results in bleeding of coffee grounds out of the 2 other holes.. Regular K Cups work work much better.. Again great idea, just not so great of a product.."
7094,B004K30HO2,ASTZPWLPHEVKJ,7/8/11,4,5,2,Not worth the trouble,"First of all, I thought I could save money filling my own Keurig K-Cups. By the time I bought the fillable cups, paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them, I was already in the hole.<br />If all you have to do is fill these little cups all day I guess it will work for you, because you can have the coffee of your choice. The other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out.<br />I still have about thirty left, and when they are gone I will not replace them."
7131,B004K30HO2,A1AV9FXFHM50WM,3/11/12,0,0,2,Not very good for me,"The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup."

It leaked all over - no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn't brew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little - leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.<br /><br />Go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew - much better results and no waste."
7166,B004K30HO2,A31YCKMHLRO5EM,1/4/12,0,0,2,"Good idea, but material is not strong enough","I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out."

The chocolate is very sweet and as you chew on this product you can tell the chocolate is loaded with sugar by the crunchy texture.

After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters."

It was a darker pink, not red at all.<br /><br />I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.<br /><br />I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to ""paint"" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.<br /><br />In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product."

Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.<br /><br />I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes."

It came as a pot, a bag of soil, and a damp paper towel with a VERY small plant inside...maybe 1 inch long.  There were absolutely no care or planting instructions or anything like that at all.  We were pretty disappointed.  However, I was able to plant what was there in the dirt and it seems to have survived and looks a bit better now.

I weighed the cans to find out which one/s had leaked and that's how i determined which one to throw away.(the weight of the cans varied, but the variance was consistent, except one can was a few ounces short)  I am hoping it was just from the one can and i don't turn up with salmonella down the road.

7810,B00474H936,AFI9UK09BNR12,10/6/12,0,0,2,"Mixed review: convenient, okay taste, bad stomach problems","I bought this mainly because another review (can't remember if it was on Amazon or another site) said it was better than Morningstar Farms crumbles and because it is GMO free. Now, I've been a vegetarian since I was thirteen (and that was decades ago), but I am the sort that DOES want fake meat resembling meat. I've little interest in a mushroom-quinoa burger; I want a meaty-yet-vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side. Also, I'm a professional chef, so I'm very picky about the foods I eat.<br /><br />I'm saying this because I think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review.<br /><br />Tonight, I used the Harmony Valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese. I also did the same recipe with the MF crumbles to compare. Two things I was curious about:<br /><br />1) flavor: they're *kind of* about the same, especially considering I was adding a browned mirepoix, marmite, and veg Worcestershire ... I guess I should fry up a patty of just the HV mix, but I did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay, but blander than MF<br /><br />2) texture: MF wins. It just does (sorry, MF haters). It has larger pieces with a more meat-like texture. Plus, even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove, the HV was too wet.<br /><br />Now, the reviewer who also liked it better than MF also said something about it holding together on its own and that MF doesn't. Well, that's true. This was thick and stuck to itself, much more like the texture of ground meat - if you were to puree it. I use MF often in meatballs, and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese. I guess that's the difference; I don't just want to thaw or add water and *poof* have dinner. I expect to cook with an ingredient, the same as I would with real beef.<br /><br />So I wasn't bowled over in those ways, but I liked it. HV hamburger mix is good and I'm sure it will be useful, which is also a plus - no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles, you've got a half dozen packets at home. I have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living, so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home. And although I've seen some reviews complaining about the 15-20 wait for the HV mix to absorb water in the fridge ... really? Those people can't wait half an hour for a burger? If you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup, buy a frozen burger. I think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and I look forward to trying!<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />After eating the lasagna made with the HV mix, both my husband and I experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain. I'm apparently a glutton for punishment, though, because I decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday. Not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones (made with MF crumbles and Lightlife sausage), they had a sort of rubbery texture that I really did not care for. But, blander and texture I can overlook, except AGAIN, the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas. Ugh!"

And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.<br /><br />I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it ""Arsenic Free"" will we assume other brands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing."
8147,B002GWMA08,A3HP0OJ5MWTATS,1/15/12,3,4,2,Good Flavor but dry beans,"My reason for the low rating is that there was no ""use by"" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that's just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee I've purchased, but probably wouldn't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness."

First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag."

But Caribou (we<br />also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily<br />brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't<br />hold a CANDLE to any of those.

Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!"

8661,B003VXFK44,A25SQ33WVST1HV,1/27/12,0,1,2,Not a fan of this blend,"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands."

The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.<br /><br />With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that."

During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect."

Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.

While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now.

Now, I will say I brew it on<br />the ""large cup"" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it's<br />a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we<br />also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily<br />brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't<br />hold a CANDLE to any of those.

Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!"

9370,B006N3IG4K,A25SQ33WVST1HV,1/27/12,0,1,2,Not a fan of this blend,"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands."

I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.

The coffee has a strange, chemical aftertaste ... cup after cup, not just once.  Even when it brews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the ""artificial flavors"" used?  Be forewarned!"

One was smashed, so leaking into the bag, two were dented, and one was coming open from the bottom due to the puddle of leaking water in the bag. I opened the bag, and it smelled awful from the rancid, leaking water. If Amazon wants to continue selling the 12-pack-33oz, it needs to package the shipping better.

I am going back to the individual single-serve containers of O.N.E., shipped from Amazon.<br />-- AND, In a second comparison, the multi-pack of Vita-Coca-33oz comes SUPERBLY packaged in the shipping box from Amazon (as EACH 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve).<br />-- Hope that helps (and, Thank you Amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box, but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us)."

It's very soft and the more you mix in color, the softer it becomes. I added powdered sugar to help make it not stick to my mat, cookie cutters and tools, but it was a constant battle. My major complaint with this fondant is that it doesn't harden. I made decorations 3 days in advance (which I've done in the past using Wilton fondant) and they weren't drying. The morning I needed them, they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape. I ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while I went to work for 8 hours, only to come home to semi-dry decorations. Because I have a ton left over, I'm going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time. I do not recommend this product if you're trying to create flowers, stars or any type of decoration that requires tools and drying time. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again."

I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any ""sweet"". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.<br /><br />So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility.

Out of the seven of us who took it, three of us just felt sick after the process.  All of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us, they were not necessarily good tricks.  I wouldn't say sour things tasted sweet for instance, I would say they tasted weird kind of like lychees but not very good ones.  The only thing I tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a Coors light.  It tasted like a pretty good Pilsner after the pill, and everyone seemed to like this, but sometimes a nice cold Coors light is just what you need, so...  If you have nothing left to spend your money on, this isn't the worst choice in the world, but don't expect a miracle, because that is not going to happen.

I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.<br /><br />Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.<br /><br />After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.<br /><br />The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money."

For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q"">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the ""sweetest"" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends, but don't expect too much."

No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient.

Whole Foods sells it, but it is a goodly distance from my house so I only get wheatgrass from them once in a great while. I have a bunny who enjoys wheatgrass as a treat, so I go to Sprouts to get it for her, but wanted to grow my own since it is expensive and requires frequent shopping trips. So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.<br /><br />I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her. I can't return it because I aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits. The grass is probably fne, but as a bunny owner, I want other bunny owners to know that this grass isn't like the wheatgrass in stores, jut so they aren't surprised and disappointed like I was."

It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt.

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity."

I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size?"

Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.
10181,B003EML8PM,A3UQAI3GUDJVJY,3/9/11,0,0,2,Wayyyyyyy too salty,"They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag."

10256,B003EML8PM,AFCUQ1C7R10YU,8/5/10,1,2,2,Not what I expected.,The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.
10257,B003EML8PM,AVEMWTYR60X3W,10/7/12,0,1,2,Lawrey's Microwave Pork rinds review,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.
10259,B003EML8PM,A1VAY8VPLQOUWE,6/6/12,0,1,2,Tasted Like Ammonia!,"So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out."

Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but I'm hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon."

I only wanted to buy one or two packets to try, but Amazon only sells them in a big box.  They're light and crispy if they're popped correctly, a little on the salty side because of the MSG seasoning (beware migraine sufferers). Not all of the bacon chips pop, and you can't eat the ones that don't because it's like plastic before they're nuked in the micro.  Now, I am stuck with the rest of the box."

However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb."

I don't know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE (""Movie Size"" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8-10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air-filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy - But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles-urge overtake me yet again."
10393,B003LE6PL0,ARM3DTVSF6INW,2/14/12,1,1,2,I am sad,"I was very disapointed with these flowers. Several of the  stargazer buds were damaged, as if they had been frozen, and several others are such that they will not  open very well, although there is still time for them to improve perhaps. But, the number of flowers for the money was wholly inadequate. On the bright side, the Iris' are blooming nicely and are beautiful. Based on the condition of the stargazers, and the inadequate number of stems,however,  i do not think I will order from this company again"
10402,B005HI55CS,A1QO97SJX0BC3R,8/7/12,1,1,2,Not for me,"Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon."

I normally get the homestyle, but is was always to dry when I ordered on line so I went to the Butter thinking it wouldn't be so dry. No such luck. When I buy from the grocery store it is much more flavorable and fresh and it doesn't cost that much more. I checked the dates and the store vs online bulk was about 6 months different on average which probably causes the difference even though they both are in the sale by date range. with this said, I am going to have to discontinue buying this product online unless something changes and I'll really miss it coming straight to my door since I eat so much. I waited for 3 months of getting this product before posting because any company can have a bad batch of anything. Sorry. I hope this changes in the future!!"

I also based my purchase on all the great reviews on this product here.  I was expecting just the white hearts of the hempseeds, sort of like when you buy shelled sunflower seeds.  When I opened the package I was severely disappointed.  It was white with black bits all over the place.  I'll upload a picture when I get the chance, it looked like dirt.  I gave it a taste and it felt like small bits of glass crunching in my mouth, it was absolutely repugnant.  Maybe I received a bad batch, who knows?  I am not here to put off other potential buyers, just telling my story on my purchase.  I'm going to try another product because I really want to add Hempseeds to my diet."
10658,B000BQUUTO,A2NAZ6EX7YIA7N,10/23/09,2,2,2,Black ants don't even get close to it,"I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house. It did not help at all. I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just don't go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection)."
10671,B00389Q4XW,AU24QSWY1IPXM,10/2/10,9,11,2,A small cup of chocolate flavored water,"For the price you pay and size of each cup (you can really only make the smallest size) you are getting taken with this purchase. Buy the traditional mix from any other company, you will get a better value, better taste and a richer texture. This snot a horrible mix, it tastes ok, but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water. It has no thickness to it. Swiss Miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down.<br />All you are getting with this is convenience of using K-cups, which is not much of one to begin with.<br />Avoid it."
10672,B00389Q4XW,A3P6IPJWS53P32,1/30/11,4,4,2,Keurig Hot Chocolate Pods,"It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore."
10675,B00389Q4XW,A187DYL1ZEPLDG,1/27/11,2,2,2,Green Mtn Hot Choc,"The hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it.  I will not be buying this product again, and will probably not consider any more green mountain products."
10679,B00389Q4XW,A32KW95EADGD6J,11/27/11,1,1,2,Not very good Hot Chocolate,I used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste.  This did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it.
10680,B00389Q4XW,A1WQ66ZW0GJUYP,10/31/11,1,1,2,Terrible Hot Chocolate,I don't like this product at all.  Much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from Nestle or Swiss Miss.
10681,B00389Q4XW,A3Q307658TBYCR,10/24/11,1,1,2,Didn't like it,"This product would be better made with milk, which of course, then would not be for the Keurig machine. There are other brands I prefer."
10682,B00389Q4XW,A2MEPSQCAP5A6U,9/23/11,1,1,2,Weak hot chocolate,This hot chocolate is pretty blah. Not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. It's not the fault of the Keurig -- the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate is way better.
10684,B00389Q4XW,AZKYK733IPF3G,8/7/11,1,1,2,Not hot.,"I've been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate, and it isn't great.  It's not badly priced, and the first few sips are fine.  But after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates.  It ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom."
10685,B00389Q4XW,A3D6AVV1FYR6RL,7/27/11,1,1,2,Not so hot cocoa,"Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate."
10687,B00389Q4XW,A2FJREW7V6866E,2/4/11,1,1,2,Cost too much...,The hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy.  You can get the same thing on the Keurig site for under $15.
10693,B00389Q4XW,A2QBZA4S1ROX9Q,9/1/12,0,0,2,Not Great,I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good).
10708,B00389Q4XW,A3PZXFWWLWZLCB,1/12/11,0,0,2,"Agree, watered down & overpriced Hot Chocolate","Very disappointed in this.  Heed the bad reviews.  I am now at the lowest amount of brewing and it still tastes watered down.  Need to dump some Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point, what was the purpose.  With the product already being overpriced (shop elsewhere)as it was and tasting watered down; it just wasn't worth it.  Skip it!  Maybe a different brand will be better."
10710,B00389Q4XW,A3IQ3RFGLD36E7,1/10/11,0,0,2,Not much flavor,"Even though the little ones liked this product, I thought it was bland and not much flavor to it.  I will not buy more of these."

10799,B001GM969M,A204K1OFE8OB9Y,1/23/12,1,1,2,Expensive considering the tiny amount provided,I wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months. This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.<br /><br />For the price I consider it a poor value. Taste is OK but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey.
10808,B001E4Q5WI,A3E9KEZ2XP7YWV,3/28/11,1,1,2,we will eat it however....,"Give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy.  Although this gives you less fat, there is a distinct taste difference.  We will eat what we purchased but I am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great PB turn into a yuckky PB..."
10812,B001E4Q5WI,A2KHJ62CQN0HUX,12/30/11,0,0,2,"Yummy, but hard to spread...","I like creamy peanut butter, however this is hard to spread because part of the oils are kept out to make it reduced fat. Kinda makes for a messy sandwich."
10824,B000XSJLWM,A2BA277004TIJM,5/31/12,1,1,2,Sugar is the second ingedient,"For the uninitiated, 'evaporated cane juice' is just sugar by another name. Another product that tries to present itself as healthy, but isn't really...eating something that lists sugar as the second ingredient isn't what I would consider to be a healthy start for the day."
10841,B0034KP00S,A2HS6ND7J8IQ0L,4/29/12,2,3,2,Not the same as the canned version,"I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond ""Roasted Almonds - Honey"" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW"">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very ""off"" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."
10844,B0034KP00S,A2ILSYQM0CO9SC,10/8/12,0,0,2,Too Much Sugar!,"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack."
10888,B0034KP00S,A21Z0377YERLCH,5/8/11,0,2,2,Not a big fan of these,"All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadn't :(  It's been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  They're just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good!"
10891,B0034KP00S,A38M9ODTWIODV,10/8/11,1,7,2,not my favorite,"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS."
10949,B000EM6PC6,A1JF6SXZU4LG8H,1/12/11,2,4,2,Not Very Good  Tea,"I've been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff I have tried yet. I believe by ""Fine Tea"" they mean small particle size. My box is about the consistency of a box of dirt, instead of nice leaf parts. Following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea. There is too much bitterness in this tea. I would definitely suggest checking out the Adagio teas. My Mother-in-Law gave me a sampler for Christmas and it had some excellent teas."
11016,B001NJI7GQ,A2PBF8V7UDJ5CP,5/21/12,0,0,2,Not the greatest.,"This product doesn't have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but it's hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and I'm not liking it, but it's tolerable when it's cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right."
11039,B001NJI7GQ,A186TK5S0LAZ7O,7/27/09,1,6,2,yuck,"I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it,"
11050,B0000VYKXC,AM4UVNWCW9NJE,10/12/07,0,2,2,"Well, if this doesn't wake you up, NOTHING will.","The folks at Starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their French Roast coffee is ""Extra Bold.""  In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week."
11053,B002RU3UNK,A1O2PN2NON3X4V,4/10/12,0,1,2,Not so good!,I would not recommend this oil.  It does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin.  It's just like other oils I have bought from drug stores which were cheaper.
11063,B001FSK3I0,A5PVUY5XYWPFY,4/13/12,1,1,2,"Overly Sweet, Flavorless","I guess I'm in the minority, but I really didn't like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste. Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste. The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value. Overall, while they aren't inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I don't even think I'll bother with the rest of the box."
11108,B002TSHYSW,A23ZGL2ELO5Y0G,7/24/12,0,1,2,Yuk,The sweet Maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion.  I was hoping to get the delicious chips that I enjoyed in Maui.  Don't wast your time.

Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips."

I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading."
11146,B00213ERI0,APWK2EKIA0PVN,3/1/12,1,1,2,Nothing special.,"I bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry, didn't have much chocolate, and left an unpleasant aftertaste.

What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it."

Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor."

Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food."

They weren't horrible but they don't taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy brand.<br /><br />They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I haven't had store-bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock-offs made with cheaper ingredients."

It is rather cheap looking and I wouldn't want this on my counter for all to see. The left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out.

Doesn't taste morning glory at all. Instead, tastes just like any one of the other in the line ... dry, stale, dense, oatmeal ""cookie,"" like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre-teen.<br /><br />In addition, cookies arrived cracked, broken and sticking to bag, yet are dry & stale inside. What a waste. I would have never purchased these in a B&M store had I had an opportunity to examine them first."

However, there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo.  It is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown (part of the heart shape).  I would buy more from this company if the shipping wasn't so costly (for the area where I live the shipping was about $10 and the product itself $15)."

At $2.82 a tin plus shipping, the Bela Sardine from Portugal blows these out of the water.  You can purchase Belas for $2.45 a tin and maybe less if you find them sold in bulk.  What am I going to do with 11 more tins of a so-so sardine.  Ugh!"
12058,B001R5QS0S,AOPM8E09HQTTV,8/19/11,0,1,2,Unfortunate mistake,I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).  It didn't taste like the original but I didn't want the hassle of sending it back and so I will not be ordering it again.  This tea did not have the strength or zing of the original.  I'm upset still.
12086,B001EQ4LEA,A437V8QIIXBZJ,2/19/12,0,1,2,A bit weak in flavor,"I really like eggnog, especially with brandy. While the ones with brandy already in them are very good, I wanted to try this product when eggnog is usually out of season.<br /><br />My experience with adding brandy to real eggnog does not create the same taste as the premixed variety. This product does not improve upon this experience.  Using a milk frother, I poured the mixture into a cup of 2% milk with about an ounce of brandy, and found that I needed about twice as much of the recommended amount of the Aspen mixture to get any eggnog flavor. The mixture will thicken in a few minutes, but the eggnog flavor is mainly sweet to me.<br /><br />However, I must mention that I have no sense of smell, and therefore my experience with this product may have been largely due to my condition."

12156,B00141UC9I,A3TY3MPD7X03BV,2/1/10,1,2,2,Ok for an expensive treat; not for a supplement,"Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere."
12223,B00141UC9I,AR6NWBRQOARN5,2/15/12,6,7,2,Not Sure,"My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand."

However, all of the Dogswell Jerky treats I have come across are Made In China. As a dog lover, I cannot knowingly give my dog a product from China. It does say ""cage-free"", but really? I'm not sure. BUT DOGSWELL Jerky Bars are Made in the USA & my dog loves this just as much! So bad news on the regular jerky, but upside: Dogswell has some USA products too!"
12243,B00141UC9I,ABCPXWIXY5KLM,6/3/12,1,1,2,Chinese Product Masquerading as American,"I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our ""furry kids"" that won't make them sick or kill them!"
12306,B0009XQSAY,AHR3UXUFDNNGK,2/16/09,7,10,2,Not as good as other canned chicken,"I have purchased numerous canned chicken products before, and of course none compare to real chicken.  However, that being said, this product's quality is considerably below that of most canned chickens.  Other canned chickens have large chunks of white meat, while this product is full of small discolored pieces with pieces of what appear to be skin or fat.  Considering the price is also higher than the store bought competitors, I can not recommend this product."

My family has a vacation home in Tunisia. I always bring some Harissa home with me, either in a glass jar or in a tube. I was excited to find this on Amazon, but it has nothing in common with the original Harissa. Harissa is a pasty substance that is very hot - way hotter than Tabasco or other brands of hot sauce common in the US. Harissa contains seeds of chili peppers. This product is barely spicy at all and the consistency is more like tomato paste. Tomato is listed as the main ingredient, hot pepper (piment) less than 8%."

They don't taste bad, and not salty at all. I don't understand why they are so hard.  Ouch.  I love the peanuts from Costco.  They are also extra large and delicious but they never hurt my stomach.  Must go back to them."

There was no damage to the box so obviously the cans were damaged prior to the packaging. At least the peanuts were OK. Maybe we are being sold ""seconds"" through Amazon by this company. Buyer beware or you may receive peanut butter rather peanuts from this company."

Unfortunately, the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems. We couldn't eat more than 8 at one time (5 for me) without getting crampy & gaseous. At first we didn't realize it was the candies causing the effect, but that changed quickly. We had to discard the rest of the product. What a shame."

I just received the order a couple of days ago. I've eaten four of the cookies and they are very good tasting. However, in two of the four cookies I found myself chewing what presumably was walnut shells! I could have easily chipped or broken a tooth.<br /><br />Pamela's makes some great products but this one is ""risky""."

Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad."

The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'."

I was excited to find these as my Husky-Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either.  They are expensive, but I decided to try them.  When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them.  I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldn't be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these.  Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for."
12481,B0015G6QVK,A1SUC50YNG730H,12/23/10,0,0,2,Some of the bisquits were hollow-not solid as they should be,The last bag of these I got from Amazon had a lot of hollow bisquits.  It was weird ......  they just weren't solid like they should be.  I'm going to switch to another brand of grain-free dog bisquits now as there's no sense in paying for something I'm not getting (and these are expensive!)  And if it wasn't for the good packaging I'd wonder if bugs had gotten to them..... but I don't think that's possible.

The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The ""hot chocolate"" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls.

They're so... bland. Like someone lightly and I mean lightly sprinkled bits of cinnamon and dried apples over cardboard. There are no vitamins added either. So there's little health value. They could've at least put some vitamins in there to make eating flavored cardboard worth it. I'll probably just eat this box as a snack alternative to potato chips. I can't afford to just toss them. Will NOT be buying them again.

First of all, it's just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if you've had those by Envirokids.

For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet-like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health-wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available! They taste nearly as bad as the new and ""improved"" ""flavor-sucked-dry"" Huggie drinks. Yuck! Absolutely dreadful.<br /><br />2 (deserved) stars."

It's hard to describe - it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. That's fine if you like it, but I didn't think it went well with chocolate. It's also very strong and sweet.<br /><br />There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders."

The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated.

I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.<br />++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back.

They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left."

I got brown colored water.<br /><br />Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called ""Eight O'Clock"" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better."

I do make it strong--I just realized how strong when I googled it a moment ago.<br /><br />This Coffee:  I used 1 Tbsp per 5-7 oz. cup.  I couldn't find the directions on the package as some people did--it must have been in small print.  It was like mud.  Way too strong.  Even so, I didn't like the flavor of the coffee.  It reminded me a lot of store bought Maxwell House or Diner coffee.  It had a bit of a burnt aftertaste to it for me.<br /><br />So, for me, I'm going to stick with Trader Joe's coffee."

Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.<br /><br />Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.<br /><br />The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.  If you are looking for a true European coffee, try Lavazza or Illy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Used grounds can be used in the garden<br />Not bitter or acidic<br /><br />CONS:<br />Bland & forgetful flavor"

Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle ""aroma.""<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.<br /><br />Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.

It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest ""souper"" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a ""treat"", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for ""my dog loved it"".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend."
13698,B0018CK2Y8,A20IA4HD66N2TD,10/16/10,0,0,2,doesn't last very long,"As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it."
13716,B004H4NC4Q,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,4/30/12,0,0,2,Not crazy about this flavor,"I found this at Wholefoods for $2.50 and bought it mainly because of the cute bottle design. I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.<br /><br />In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. It's a common food additive, but I'm not sure what it's doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. That's nothing a good shaking can't fix.<br /><br />The bottle is too nice to throw out, so I'll reuse it for my own beverages. (The cap screws on.) Brewed and bottled in Chicago. I won't be buying this flavor again."

They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely.  I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.<br /><br />I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.<br /><br />List of ingredients:<br />Sugar 62g per 100g<br />Glucose-fructose syrup<br />Lemons<br />Gelling Agent: Pectin, Citric Acid<br />Acidity Regulator:Sodium Citrate<br />Flavoring: Lemon Oil<br />Color:Caramel E150C<br /><br /> Price with shipping slightly over $11.<br /><br />I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea.  I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce.  I am so disappointed!<br /><br />8/22/11 Update<br />Normally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant.<br />Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email.  I contacted them over the weekend letting them know I was disappointed in the product. On Monday I received a notification of a full refund.  So if you like jellies the stellar customer service removes the risk of giving it a try."

These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes.  I've never met a brownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream).  The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.  They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free.  Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them.  They mold quickly.

I microwaved them for slightly less time than instructed and only about 1/5 of them changed consistency from the little flat parallelograms to a slightly puffier flat paralleogram.  Next batch I did a little longer and a couple more of them puffed up a little bit.  Even the puffy ones seem to have patches of tremendously hardened pork(don't laugh) in them to a point where when you eat one and there are pork rind shards that break away from the puffy.  I tried one last time and microwaved them for a minute and a half longer than instructed and this time the puffy ones overcooked and burned and the others stayed in tiny, hard form(again, don't laugh).<br /><br />If anyone that orders these and learns any tips that I might be missing, please let me know. They will be in their resealable package in the pantry until that point or they expire.<br /><br />Thanks."

A large number of them won't puff up for me at all no mater how long I cook them, either. Maybe my microwave is underpowered, I dunno, but when even the puffed ones are not somehow tastier I just don't see the point. I feel like I really wasted my money on these."
13862,B002O5QWD8,AG59C54KFB9GH,1/13/12,0,0,2,Not as good as I hoped,"The pork rinds cooked up fairly well in the microwave, but the smell was less than appetizing and the taste was fair at best."

That's what I wanted it for.  I figured I'd be able to load this thing up with cheese and fill the olives quickly.  It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.  It just doubles the time it would take you to get your olives ready.  If they could make one of these with a big chamber that could hold lots of cheese, we'd be in business!"

Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong.

I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.

When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)"

But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup!

My dog Kirby was very excited as I opened the package and announced ""Ooooh, I have a treeeeeat for you!"" in the high pitched voice I use to get him worked up.  However, it was all downhill from there.  He eagerly took a cookie in his mouth, then gave me a look like ""Seriously?""  He will eat them, but only if there is nothing better going.<br />  My husband was going to try one to give a second opinion.  However, after smelling them he announced that they smell like burnt oatmeal and probably taste like it too, and he refused to try them.<br />  I give these 2 stars because I would like my dog to eat them (as opposed to fatty pig ears), but he really doesn't care much for them.

Unfortunately these are much smaller than I thought they were. Two, three bites tops and my dogs would have them down, and they didn't seem to like them as much as they like their regular bones (cheap, regular bones).

I have 3 large breed dogs which usually love to eat just about anything. I have Rocky, a black and tan coonhound, Buddy, a blue heeler and a very large pit bull named Hutch. Rocky and Buddy have turned up their noses in disdain to these treats everytime I have offered them. The pit bull Hutch will eat them very grudgingly and even then he'll leave half of the treat on the ground, this is odd because, he'll eat just about anything including tree branches. So, I wouldn't pay the higher price for these treats, my dogs just don't like them."

I also smelled the biscuits and didn't notice much flavor/scent at all.<br /><br />I gave one square each to my two dogs.  While my one-year-old dog gobbled it up (as she does with everything, and may have swallowed it whole for all I know), my six-year-old dog was hesitant at first.  He sniffed it a bit and then had a very hard time taking that first bite into the very hard biscuit.  I think he was afraid of breaking his teeth!  (And he chews on very hard toys/bones/rawhide.)  He didn't seem too wild about the taste either, as he wasn't in any rush to finish the square after he broke into it.  They looked and probably tasted like cardboard, so I can see why.<br /><br />I appreciate what Newman's is trying to do for dogs in giving them healthier snack alternatives, but please don't break my dogs' teeth!"

I figured giving him a treat like this would really satisfy his chewing instinct. This treat is VERY hard. It comes in a rectangle shape that is divided in half and I tried to break it into two smaller treats and had a difficult time. My dog did not like the flavor either. He preferred to play with these rather than eat them. Usually he will eat a treat in about a minute but this treat stayed in his cage with him picking it up and dropping it for hours. He has very powerful jaws and he usually tears up most of his toys in a day or two, yet he did not wont to eat these very much. Whatever they put in this is not very appealing to dogs apparently.<br /><br />Your dogs may like this better (hopefully). Again this is a VERY hard threat so make sure your dogs don' t mind having to gnaw at it for awhile.

We were in the room and casually observed him as he chewed on it.  Our dog had the whole thing eaten within an hour.<br /><br />He seemed fine and the next morning his bathroom routine was completely normal.  However, when we got home from work, it was clear that the poor guy had been struggling not to have an accident.  When we got him outside, he had multiple explosive bowel movements.  A little further examination showed us that, despite his best efforts, his butt had been leaking during the day.  He had also given himself a hemorrhoid.

Perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box.  The box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. None appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box.

Of the first six I've tried, five have blown open and spewed coffee grounds all over our machine (as well as in the cup). I'm getting rather tired of cleaning the Keurig. Normally, I buy our K-cups at local department store but buying in bulk here at Amazon was less expensive. Amazon has graciously replaced the first lot and I was told if this second lot has the same problems, to call them back and they will need to look at pulling the lot. After looking back at the reviews for this product, I think that would be a wise move considering many of us are having the same problem. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is 5-star so I haven't lost my money."

When this happens it makes a huge mess.  The machine has to be totally cleaned each time.  It appears that the seal at the top of the kcups is not properly attached.  The ones that do survive make excellent tasting coffee, but I will not reorder them online again.  Very disappointed, makes some of the best tasting coffee we have tried, but only got to drink a little of it."

I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very brownie-like texture, there is an aftertaste I didn't like that I notice in many GF baking mixes.  Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey.  My non-GF family & friends said they were ""weird"" and ""different"".  Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another.  I'm sticking with the flourless brownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them."

I discovered it's not possible to return a subscribe 'n save order (for some reason) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead.

I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat."

If you break off a piece, you can see the sugar crystals glinting in the chocolate.<br /><br />Second, it had almost no flavor.

If you buy something from Xylitol USA that arrives in bad shape and you want to return it for a refund, the company will tell you that they do not accept food back. When I insisted that the product was old (in my case two bags of xylitol sweetened dark chocolates that were old, whitish and tasteless) they said that they would NOT refund my money and, amazingly enough, offered a 25% discount on my NEXT purchase. I disputed the payment and my bank took care of the situation got me my  money back. No more purchases from this company for me."

They are about even on Calories but the Whenever Bar gets 80 of its 180 from fat, whereas the Cherrios bar gets only 35 of its 160 from fat.  The Whenever Bar has 15mg of Cholesterol, whereas the Cherrios bar has none.  The two bars are about even on Total Carbohydrates.<br /><br />To me this bar does not taste like Chocolate Chips - maybe that taste is overwhelmed by the heavy Coconut flavor.  If these were called Coconut bars, with a hint of Chocolate - maybe I would give them a higher rating - but, to me, the flavors are not as the product name would lead me to believe.<br /><br />I really was underwhelmed by this product, and unless you are a big Coconut fan, you probably want to buy something else."

Well, the ""good"" is it has some decent ingredients (some fiber, aguave, rice blend flour-- no high frucose corn syrup) but the ""bad"" is it tastes terrible.  I couldn't even finish the one cookie (it comes in a small rectangular bar, maybe 2 and a half inches long by an inch plus wide and 1/2 inch thick.  I'm usually pretty good with words, but although I like the texture, moist part of this cookie, the flavor is indescribably dreadful; I wish I could be more precise, it negatively tickles the taste buds.  You don't feel you would get sick eating it, but you might consider using it as a torture on someone. I would ask my wife to try it, but I want to live.  There are other better products on the market that taste much better, power bars, etc.  Some people may question aguave being ""good,"" but I think it is better than staight sugar or corn syrup--correction--there is some evaporated cane sugar in the product as well as coconut sugar. It has 180 calories, so keep that in mind."

As for me, I don't think this is worth the money.<br /><br />Here are my test results:<br /><br />My 2 year old grandson loved them.  The 6 year old rejected them handily.<br />I only tasted them lightly for reasons I will list below.<br />They are gluten free and non dairy if you need that.<br />They contain organic ingredients if that is what you are looking for<br /><br />But:<br />They have 8 g of sugars and these sugars are very heavy on the fructose.  Both agave and coconut sugars are 60 to 90% fructose.  Now, I choose not to argue with anybody who wants to defend fructose.  I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs.<br />They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.<br /><br />Here is the kicker:  they have only 2 g of protein per serving so they would not be a good exchange for a meal.<br /><br />I tend to buy a far cheaper store brand version of Quaker oats granola bars. Ounce for ounce they have about the same amount of sugar and fat, far less saturated fat, and about the same number of calories, except they come in smaller 100 calorie packages so I only eat that one. I find them filling enough to be satisfying. The grandsons love them and everybody is happy."

If you don't like coconut then avoid them. The picture also shows chocolate, which is in there for sure, but it is overpowered by the other flavors.<br />The bar itself isn't very appetizing looking. It looks like a wad of granola trail mix was mixed with oils or butter then squashed. This is also about what it tastes like.<br />The rest of the box will get eaten as soon as all other snacks have been eaten and they are the only snack left."
15249,B00503DP0O,A18MBO1U4DPY20,2/16/12,1,1,2,Awful to taste.,These taste really awful. I've tried plenty of choc chip coconut cookies but these are barely edible. My guests weren't delighted when I asked them to try these. Don't recommend.

15364,B003U2HTHM,A32MTWRC6P52YN,7/23/12,3,3,2,Not as shown and who is Sheryl?,"I was disappointed when I received this bonsai desert rose for a number of reasons.<br /><br />First, the packaging.  I have mail ordered other bonsai so was disappointed at how much dirt came out during the unwrapping process.  I would highly recommend you unwrap outdoors, perhaps on grass where you don't care about the dirt.<br /><br />Second, the bonsai I received is not the one shown, or even really much like it.  I was hoping for the gnarled, twisted root and trunk look in the picture.  What I received was basically a fat trunk, no gnarls, no twists.  There are feeder roots coming off the trunk almost 3 inches above the dirt level.  The base does not seem firmly rooted in the pot at all.  In fact, if you grasp the trunk, you can easily lift the entire rootball out of place, without disturbing much of the surrounding soil or decorative pebbles.  Almost like it was just shoved into the pot for shipping to me.  It was advertised as suitable for a beginner, but I am going to have to do some quick research and see about repotting it more securely into the pot.  Far from what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Third, the plant ccame with a sheet of general instructions, not specific to this type of plant.  The first paragraph tells you how vitally important a humidity tray is for the plant's well being.  Why not add $7 to the price and include the darn thing rather than making me call in a separate order and pay for more shipping.<br /><br />Fourth, who the heck is Sheryl?  I made this purchase based on another review which mentioned how nice Sheryl was to deal with on a problem.  This shipment came from Lou's Bonsai--no Sheryl in sight.  Not that it really matters, but it seems odd.<br /><br />I have been bitten by the bonsai bug hard and intend to purchase more, but I most likely will not buy another bonsai from this seller.  There are other sellers available on Amazon and over the internet that will ship you exactly what you see in the picture, rooted into their pots appropriately, etc.  I gave the review two stars because the plant itself seems basically healthy."
15365,B003U2HTHM,AOKTX5J5S99FR,7/26/12,2,2,2,Not as pictured AT ALL. False listing!,"I agree with the other review. Beware: the plant is not as pictured or anything like it. I purchased this Desert Rose for my dad because he fell in love with the one in the photo and the description (~15 years old desert rose). The Amazon shipping weight says 21lbs, mine was UPS 3lbs. I was totally disappointed as I paid $95 with shipping just to get a desert rose that does not look like it's 15 years old. The caudex on the plant I got was only ~2-3"" wide and the one in the photo looks about ~6-7""+ wide.<br /><br />I contacted Lou immediately (I also have no idea why the seller's name is Sheryl when the actual seller is LouBonsai) and he is great at responding. He told me he would ship me a new plant and I kept emailing to make sure it's not just ANY desert rose, but SPECIFICALLY the one similar to the photo. However, their responses were brief and not descriptive about what they are sending (i.e. the response was ""BIGGER AS I WAS TOLD""). I felt as if my concerns were not answered. Lou said he was going to send me a new plant with a tracking number on 7/23 but I heard nothing. I had to email him on 7/25 to ask, they provided one and said I was able to track it the next day. It's 7/27 now and the UPS tracking number still says that a label has been created but package is not dropped off yet. I'm a very disappointed customer at this point.<br /><br />It would be nice for them to list the actual plant they are selling because it's definitely not the one I received.<br /><br />2 stars for responsiveness."

They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.

I thought it would make good ""BLT's"", but without the real beacon. It was just OK for me. The product does come as described and tastes OK, but something about it just tasted too fake and I didn't like the texture. It's not real creamy lake mayo, or even low-cal mayo. I like low-cal fry sauce a lot better. I have to say though, it's just a taste thing, and someone else might love it. I still use it on burgers, (mixed with light mayo), but no one in my family really cares for it that much.<br />I wasn't happy that with free shipping it took a month before it was even sent out, that seemed a little ridiculous. The packaging was good. I like that the jars are plastic and not glass. However, I would not purchase again or recommend, because the flavor is just OK."

Generally, I like coffee people donut shop, and that had been my go to coffee for a while.  The dark bold coffees are way too intense for me, but the mediums are generally way too weak.  Wanting to try something new, I followed the reviews and tried this coffee thinking it would be a good strong but-not-too-strong alternative.<br /><br />It wasn't.  If I use two pods, this is a decent, but weaker, coffee for me to use in my travel cup for the ride into work.  Otherwise, it is much too weak.  I was very surprised that the first time I brewed some and poured in half and half, the coffee turned very light brown.  It was almost white.  I will get through this package, but I will not buy again.  It's not cost effective for me to use two pods to be satisfied.  Any other suggestions?"

I've tried it for 3 days now, and I still get the bitter taste after drinking it.  I did a little research online and have heard the same complaints from some other users.  The problem is believed to be all the preservatives that are added.  I thought I was getting pure sucralose and didnt realize there are added preservatives to this product.  I have since found that there is one website that sells pure liquid sucralose with no added preservatives.  Some people buy powdered sucralose and make their own liquid using only purified water.

They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service provided by Euro Food Mart."

On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.<br />Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.<br />Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected."

This variety, on the other hand, had excellent Kiwi and Strawberry flavors.  However, I emphasize FLAVORS because that is where the Switch drinks get gimmicky.  They are all marketed under the flavors/juices that appear WAY DOWN on the ingredient listing.  The several varieties that I have tried all have apple and white grape juice as the top ingredients.  This seems like false advertising to me, since those juices are clearly not as appealing.  Anyway, this drink is all about the marketing.  The price you are paying for 8 ounces of carbonated juice is clearly an extravagance, and I wouldn't do it again.  Save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store."

While the ingredient list certainly does confirm the particularly natural recipe required to create this beverage, I'm afraid I cannot endorse it very highly.  I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of ""Switch,"" probably wouldn't think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.<br /><br />The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it's still too sweet.  It's also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at ""carbonation"" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it's carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as ""carbonated"" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn't be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.<br /><br />In short, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase ""Switch.""  I would drink it at need, when nothing else is available, but I find it to be a contradiction in form and marketing that clearly demonstrates the disingenuous motives of the company that produces it."

If I were thirsty and no other drink was available, I would drink it, but even if I were to like the taste, when I want a drink, I almost always want more than the 8.3 ounces contained in the can.  (Why 8.3 ounces?)  I wonder if the market for this drink is for those who must religiously consume liquids in extreme moderation.  It must be quite hard to come up with a successful new drink product. The Switch Kiwi Berry may be a perfect demonstration of how hard it is.  Better luck next time."

I've said before that I am not a fan of carbonated drinks and this flavor just reminded me why.<br /><br />There's no taste of berry nor kiwi in it, and the thing just flat out tastes like carbonated plastic. For a drink claiming to be ""all natural"", no sugar, or preservatives...it sure tastes quite like the opposite. Now I don't know if I just received a defective can, but it isn't it sure didn't quench my thirst and I needed to eat a ""hot pocket"" just to get rid of the odd after taste. Cool packaging, less than good taste.<br /><br />I didn't like it! [2 Stars]"

To its benefit, there was no icky after taste.<br /><br />I will not be 'switch'ing anytime soon to this drink, but recommend giving it a try, as all our taste buds are different.

It was more cherry or ?? to me. I would've liked a little more fizz to it, I consider it just lightly carbonated. Also, I cannot imagine consuming 33grams of sugar in just over 8oz, it tasted WAY to sweet for me.<br />It kind of bothers me to see 'natural flavors' listed in the ingredients too...like what type of 'natural flavors'???

The added kiwi flavor, in particular, imparts a odd sour aftertaste that I just could not get used to.  My children each tried a sip, and for them as well the opinion was mixed.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the Switch Black Cherry (even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak), but I can't be very enthusiastic about this flavor."

One can has 8.3 ounces, which is a bit less than most Americans are used to for a canned drink, but would be a good serving size for kids.  It does have 135 calories, which is a lot, when I could just drink a diet cola for either no calories or one calorie.  Sure, there would be a lot more unnatural additives, but this drink isn't even organic, which many others on the market are.

Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this kiwi/berry, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called ""Kiwi Berry"", but there is NO kiwi fruit even listed on the ingredient panel. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars. For only 8.3 ounces of liquid, we are drinking 135 empty calories;however, this is a high level of vitamin C.

First off, it seemed rather syrupy, but then I realized that's just because the sweetness factor is, apparently, set to eleven. It wasn't actually a struggle to finish it, but it was so cloyingly sweet it makes the average episode of ""Full House"" look like sour, cynical crap. It made me want to reach for insulin, though I don't take any.<br /><br />I suppose this might be a good drink for young children who don't have well-developed palettes, but if you're past the age of, say, nine, this probably isn't the drink for you."

16689,B001LGGH40,A2AQUIHJELUVLE,3/20/09,0,0,2,Much too sweet,"This drink would have gotten 4.5 stars from my kids but as an adult, this drink was much too sweet for my husband and myself.  We would never drink anything this cloyingly sweet.  It's made with fruit juice concentrates and flavorings reconstituted with filtered sparkling water.  What I'd rather have, and what I make at home frequently, is a normal fruit juice, such as pineapple (no sugar added) and sparkling mineral water.  It cuts the sweetness of the juice, has just enough flavor, a little fizz and is even good for you.  Switch, I'm afraid has none of this, it's just too sweet and has too much fake flavoring.  We tried the Kiwi Berry and it tasted like overpowering strawberry fake-flavoring, like strawberry flavored candies.  Sorry, Switch, but you could make this simpler and better very easily."
16691,B001LGGH40,AR9GZ8B7NJJPN,2/23/09,8,10,2,I like the can,"The can is pretty, a vibrant carnation pink. But although the can purports to contain 100% juice, a quick inspection reveals that apple and grape, not kiwi and berry (strawberry, raspberry) get top billing on the ingredients list.  Unsurprisingly, the flavor seems a little muddled, a little tangy, awfully sweet.  One family member described it as bubble gummy, another noted that it tasted metallic but ""maybe in a glass bottle it would taste okay.""<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this product is heavy on fruit sugars, though I appreciate the absence of that cloying corn syrup sweetener that contaminates so many popular soft drinks.  There is nothing particularly nutritious about Switch, but maybe some parents (presumably the target market) won't be able to figure that out.<br /><br />It's not the worst carbonated beverage I've ever tried, but it's nowhere near the best, nor does it have the fresh wholesome flavor that we spoiled consumers expect from our fruit juices.  I'll stick with water."

The carbanation level of the drink is low.  I think I was expecting this soda to be somewhere inline with Jones Soda.  This would certainly not be an item I would want to purchase again."
16723,B001LGGH40,A28CCN6VYHRUKS,3/17/09,0,0,2,Too sweet for my tastes.,"I have reviewed three different flavors of Switch. This one, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Of the three flavors by favorite, by far, is the Black Cherry. It had a much more mild taste and didn't seem nearly as sweet as this one. If you like a lot of kick in your juice, and an almost over powering flavor this one may be for you. However, that is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />I much prefer the Black Cherry over the other two."
16724,B001LGGH40,ABNMD6670TV53,3/17/09,0,0,2,Lots of calories and carbs,"This product is labeled ""100% of what you want"". But one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree. While it contains 100% juice and vitamin C, no preservatives or sugar, it contains 135 calories, 15 mg of sodium, and a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrates. All this in a tiny 8.3 oz can! I also thought it was too sweet for my tastes, but I normally drink a diet carbonated beverage, so the sweetness did jump out at me. Just okay. I won't add this to my shopping list."
16727,B001LGGH40,A2CIQEY05SPHTZ,3/16/09,0,0,2,Where is the Kiwi?,I got this drink expecting the carbonated taste combined with kiwi and berries. Well I could taste the berries but no kiwi. I did like the carbonation with real fruit juices without the added sugar but it is not low cal. I think that I liked this drink better than the tangerine drink but still is not for me. The drink is way too sweet for me to enjoy it.
16745,B001LGGH40,A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,3/13/09,0,0,2,Sweetness Overload,"My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Kiwi Berry was the least desirable of the two.  It tasted like it had way too much sugar, even though the can claims to have no sugar added.  The strawberry flavor was predominant, overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely.  In all, it tasted like strawberry candy.  Even worse -- it had a kind of chemical-y bitterness to it.  If you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy, go ahead and try Switch.  But if not -- avoid this.  I would especially not want to buy this flavor.  There are better ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix."

It neither seemed too ""berry"" or too ""kiwi"" -- it was a nice balance. I would compare this to a strongly-flavored carbonated water product. The flavor is clean and crisp, and not overpowering.<br /><br />The product provides 100% of vitamin C -- a definite plus. However, the product has 34g of carbs, 33g of which are sugars. Granted, these are not processed sugars and are only natural sugars from the fruit juices the product contains. However, this results in a product that has 135 calories in an 8.3-ounce can. This results in a poor substitute for soda.<br /><br />It's an all-natural product, and tastes great, but has entirely too many calories for such a small serving."

Also, at 135 calories in an 8.3 ounce can, it actually contains a lot more calories than regular soda. I know it is all natural and doesn't have HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup), and I appreciate that, but it also doesn't have much actual kiwi or berry juices. The drink is VERY sweet, but sweeter than 100% fruit juice, sweeter even than your average can of soda. I can't say I would ever buy this product or recommend it to anyone else. There are better natural sodas on the market, as well as better 100% natural juices."

I could drink a regular can of soda. Going forward, I probably would not buy this beverage because I do not like to drink that many calories (135) or sugar (33 grams) in one sitting."
16773,B001LGGH40,A20QDPC3E3WQI6,3/6/09,0,0,2,Sickening sweet,"This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a ""diet"" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option."

The drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this 8.3oz can won't be enough.  The cost is too way expensive to enjoy this drink on a regular basis.  The cute can and unique drink combination doesn't make up for the sweet/tart taste, small skinny can and high price.  Save your money, drink water."

I drink allot of water, which does not have 135 Calories for 8.3 oz.<br /> It says, No surgar added, No preservatives..Believe me, it does not need anymore of a sugar taste..<br />33 Gr. of natural sugar!<br /><br />If your a soda drinker etc. you might find this a better choice."

I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.<br /><br />The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.<br /><br />The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.<br /><br />I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really. Do yourself a favor: eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water. You'll enjoy it more and your body will thank you.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009"

It's lightly carbonated, which I like but too sweet for my taste (think strawberry candy). The mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it. It's made from juice concentrates and carbonated water and there are 135 calories of sugar in the small 8 oz can. I wouldn't call it a healthy beverage and whether it's natural or not doesn't matter to me."

It's also a bit expensive for what your getting.......need I say more?......I think not!"
16840,B001LGGH40,A1E110L9ZKX6FD,4/22/09,0,1,2,Good tasting but bad for you.,So how does it taste? Well depends on how sweet you like your drinks. It is tasty but it's not as the container would leave you to believe that it is good for you. This is no better then drinking a soda filled with corn syrup because of the amount of calories and carbs it contains. It's all sugar and it shows not only going in but around the mid section if you pounded these things for a few months straight.<br /><br />Pass.

But the Kiwi Berry flavor was too sweet for me.  While the ingredients are only juice and carbonated water, I think that not enough water was added to reconstitute the juice to a good balance.  With 33 grams of sugar in the 8.3 ounce bottle, despite being natural, there is still a lot of sweetness here."

Do people who consume this think they're drinking something healthy, or indulging in liquid candy?  Or is this supposed to be used as a mixer, e.g., for making daiquiris?"

Flavor-wise it's not bad, though. Maybe it's only fruit sugar and supposedly fruit sugar isn't as bad for the health, but still... way too sweet for something that's supposed to be ""healthy.""<br /><br />Maybe little kids would like it as a treat.

At 135 calories per can, it's slightly higher in carbs than an average soda.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because although it is refreshingly free of high fructose corn syrup, it claims to be ""all natural"" -- not sure what's natural about juice concentrate. And, like regular soda, it is chock full of ""empty"" carbs -- like eating raw sugar. I get the feeling from the packaging we're supposed to think it's a healthier alternative, and this seems disengenious at best.<br /><br />It tastes OK, but really isn't anything special; it doesn't taste like kiwi fruit and only vaguely of strawberries."
16887,B001LGGH40,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,2/25/09,1,1,2,Tastes like bubblegum,"I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.<br /><br />Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.<br /><br />So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.<br /><br />Not very good."

They both begin with : 'Filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates'... What? Not to mention, the first 2 main ingredients are apple and grape-both not the 'flavour' I ordered. Anyway, I rarely read labels to begin with, but for something supposedly 100% juice, I was curious...<br /><br />Ok, now for the taste, or lack thereof. It was slightly fizzy, nothing like full-blown soda, but jeez was it sweet. Like, nasty mediciny sweet. I could not finish the can. I couldn't even taste what flavour it was suppose to be. That's all there is to it. I am giving it 2 stars because it supposedly has 100% Vitamin C, which is a pretty much the only redeaming quality to this not juice but not soda type drink."

Part of it may be the other fruit jucices mixed in (Apple, Grape, Raspberry, and Strawberry)with more Apple and Grape than Kiwi. For me it was too sweet and did not taste too much like Kiwi fruit."
16895,B001LGGH40,A3QD59N3M7O7KB,2/25/09,1,1,2,"Tastes pretty good, BUT....","We got this in the mail and were eager to try it.  I am a huge fan of Izze Sparkling Juice and figured this would be similar to that.  It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.<br /><br />TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.<br /><br />BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.<br /><br />VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.  The benefits just aren't there, not when I can get 100% real fruit juice at the store for 3 dollars a gallon, and add a bit of soda water myself for another buck, if that.  Save your money"

The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.<br /><br />No thanks."

At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.<br />I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.<br />Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the ""Switch"" carbonated fruit juice drinks.<br />Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don't care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also. Both during and after you swallow it."

Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.  While this is 100% juice (from concentrate though) and nicely bubble (I shook mine up prior to drinking, no massive explosion or anything and I'm at altitude), I'd rather drink something something with either a little more flavor or a little more of it."
16912,B001LGGH40,A26KHZE0HTS057,2/27/09,3,4,2,Not enough Kiwi or Berry and too much filler juices,"The initial taste does hint of something, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after- taste.  Comparing this to the Black Cherry drink, Kiwi Berry has a better taste and after taste.  However, if you would have told me that this was the Black Cherry flavor, I would have thought that to be true.  I could not note any significant difference between flavors.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation."

I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting.

One has to read down PAST the legal disclaimers to find what flavors are included.  And even once one gets to the Product Features section which reveals the included flavors, one must first get past the hype:<br /><br />Product Description<br />Every refreshing variety lets you add flavor to you water without adding calories. These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate<br /><br />Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light ""Natural"" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />""Natural"" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, ""natural"" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does ""taste"" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical. (Yeah, I know, I don't ""have"" to buy it.  They don't ""have"" to be greedy ba$t@rd$ either.)"
17279,B007ZQMJA6,A1GVCV406I5SNV,9/11/12,1,1,2,Not like yoo-hoo,"I love yoo-hoo.  it's one of my favorite 'gas station' buys...meaning, i don't buy it from the store, but if i'm going on a trip or something, i'll pick up a yoo-hoo.<br /><br />I was super surprised to find this drink mix.  It was cheap and I thought the kids and i would like making our own yoo-hoo at home.  i was totally disappointed.  it does not taste like yoo-hoo. it tastes nasty.  almost too sweet?  and it doesn't dissolve well in milk.  you can stir and stir, and you still have nasty clumps floating on the top of your milk.<br /><br />i did give it two stars because...well, it's drinkable.  and my kids kind of like it."
17283,B000EVIDUY,AE7MO1SL2EVC5,9/10/07,28,31,2,These USED to be the best out there! Now they're just OKAY.,"WHY, OH WHY would Gluten Free Pantry mess with a great thing? The reviews of this product are ALL from pre-recipe change. I wonder what everyone thinks now that the recipe has changed. The FIRST ingredient in these brownies used to be DUTCH COCOA and OH, were they decadent! But NOW, they don't stand out above any other mix out there. They are just ""okay"", where they used to be FAR superior, heads and shoulders above the competition! I'm extremely disappointed. They taste so BLAH now. I won't be buying them anymore."
17331,B000EVIDUY,A25ETVRL1LE4LN,4/3/10,0,0,2,Disappointing,"I bought the six pack case and after baking the first two boxes I am confident that I won't be purchasing this again. If you are looking for chocolate decadence, you won't find it here. The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter/margarine as directed. Maybe then I'll get that chewy, gooey richness that this products claims. There is a strange aftertaste, not one that I wish to linger. Betty Crocker G/F brownie mix is by far a better tasting brownie and less expensive. My vote is G/F with Betty C!"
17357,B000EVIDUY,A3U3OPFXKE9G4Z,3/9/08,0,0,2,what am i doing wrong?,This brownie mix came to us in a gift box and we loved them so we bought a case.  Since then we have problems with them.  Are they supposed to be oily and come out bubbly and liquidy? i don't remember them doing that the first time. It's like they separate- baked on the edges and goo in the middle- and it doesn't matter how long they are baked.  We still eat them but i wonder if there's something wrong or if we're doing something wrong?!!
17374,B000UJW0W2,A4LD7404KMX2A,9/19/11,2,2,2,Creates a bigger mess..........,"This mat is worthless. It is tiny and doesn't stay put so the cat still gets litter every where. Like others said the mat is uncomfortable and the cat just jumps over it. So instead of having litter right in front of the box, she tracks it all over the room. Don't buy!"
17375,B000UJW0W2,A17ED9J0J0UJ9G,5/17/11,2,2,2,Regret buying,"When I bought this mat I initially thought it was fine but it actuality is too small and at the beginning my cats didn't like stepping on it either.  Because of it' small size, I end up with daily litter on either side of this mat.  Disappointed and now looking for a replacement that catches more of the litter."
17376,B000UJW0W2,APPJNVNF4BFLB,3/20/10,2,2,2,Not the best,"Cute, inexpensive litter mat.  However, the side curled up and will not flatten down, plus it will not stay in place on our Linoleum floor."
17379,B000UJW0W2,A309PFW8T6DMMZ,10/9/12,0,0,2,It is not large enough,"This product is very cute - I have it in the tan color and the cat graphic is nice. However, it does not cover enough square footage. The narrow end is particularly troublesome. However, it is durable - mine has lasted for two years. Yet because of the mess that inevitably winds up near the mat but not on the mat (because the mat is too small), I will be replacing this item.<br /><br />Additionally, if you are neat freak, you probably won't like this item because certain debris can become tightly lodged in the prongs of this mat - you can clean it with a power hose outdoors, but that will be a pain to do every few days. Just a paper towel and/or a dust pan are not sufficient to thoroughly clean this item."
17380,B000UJW0W2,AOHP92YTT6I21,9/26/12,0,0,2,"Good idea, but WAY TOO SMALL!",Needs to be at least twice the size it is to be effective. When the cats did manage to step on it after leaving the box it did a good job of collecting litter that I could dump back into the litter box.
17383,B000UJW0W2,A3K2F03FWDOBHO,3/22/12,0,0,2,Not Big Enough,"The thick plastic that this mat is made of is really easy to clean, as you can just vacuum up any excess litter.  Some cats may not like the pointed surface of the mat; my cat doesn't seem to mind.  The main problem is that the mat is so small that most of the time my cat ends up exiting from a different side of the litter box, and thus the mat doesn't do any good.  I'm looking to purchase a different mat, because the small size of this one renders it all but useless."
17385,B000UJW0W2,A9QYV26DWB333,11/30/11,0,0,2,If only my cat liked it...,"This mat is just fine... by me. My cat, on the other hand, avoids it like the plague. It must feel funny to her little toes. I don't think she has stepped on it a single time. Her entire room will be littered with litter (sorry, couldn't resist), but this mat will remain perfectly clean, because she avoids it so religiously. I find myself wondering why I keep using it. I really should just throw it out.<br /><br />I'm sure there are cats out there who might not mind. But, for my cat, this was a no go."
17388,B000UJW0W2,A12RXIGI4Z7U4A,4/30/11,0,0,2,Cheap Price - but save your money,"This mat is so small, and as others have noted, the ""turf"" is pointy - so it probably hurts cats' paws (it hurts my knees!)  My cat jumps right over it and I end up with litter kicked up all over the place.  Seems like a good concept, but I would bet it doesn't solve most people's problem of trying to contain the litter.<br /><br />I just bought an extra large Petmate Litter Catcher that has 4-1/2 stars.  Hopefully, I'll have more success with that!"
17389,B000UJW0W2,AELPZZW84KV7D,4/17/11,0,0,2,not worth it,Inexpensive little mat. But it's so small and doesn't help when my cat kicks litter out of anywhere other than right in front of the box. And like others have written its got little spokes poking out so my cat didn't even like to step on it so it made even more of a mess. It needed to be cleaned daily and it was just overall more hassle than the small price tag.
17391,B000UJW0W2,AMXEQE0T3VYOV,8/9/10,1,2,2,Mat is too stiff!,I have older mats that have a ribbed surface and work great. These have small stiff points and actually hurt to lean on or kneel on. I can imagine that they hurt my cats paws ad that is why they tend to jump over them when exiting the littler box.
17396,B001THQ7YQ,AEHLZWSA5XM9K,4/23/12,1,1,2,It's not what it seems...,"I ordered this product for my wife who remembered these things from childhood. Originally she wanted some Circus Peanuts, but upon seeing this product, she remembered the enjoyment she had as a child. At any rate, the Brach's Chicks & Rabbits was $9.99 for a 10.5 ounce package. I thought this was a little pricy, and could not easily determine how big of a package this actually was, but bought it anyway.<br /><br />We got the candy after a few days with Amazon Prime, but when it came, I was thoroughly disappointed. The package (not shipping material, but actual bag of candy) was in battered condition, but not being punctured, we kept it. The candy itself was very stale - and exactly like Circus Peanuts candy (just a different shape/color).<br /><br />In short, go for the $1.00 package of circus peanuts before spending $10 on this. My recommendation is to buy this product for nostalgia, not enjoyment."
17409,B000Y2LYCC,AOA41F1EHBDT0,2/17/08,5,8,2,Walnuts don't work,"I was looking for a non-peanut mixed nut that was pre-packaged in a small quantity for taking to work as part of lunch or for a snack.<br />Overall, this met the criteria, but there were problems because they used walnuts. Walnuts are less stable and go rancid faster than other nuts typically used in ""mixed nuts"". So, after the first few encounters with bad walnuts, I just began avoiding the walnuts. The mix would work better with pecans instead of walnuts. They hold up better.<br />I'm not likely to buy this again"
17421,B0045Z6K50,A2SXFV8EHCMY5F,12/17/11,0,0,2,Newman k cup,I have ordered this blend several times & liked it.<br />This shipment was bitter. Maybe it was just a bad batch or maybe old.
17462,B0045Z6K50,A1JFKMK7CKWMR,2/25/11,1,2,2,Extra Bold?,"After buying my Keurig, I've done a bit of experimenting with different varieties of coffees available.  I've enjoyed other Newman's Own products, so this one caught my eye.  I was disappointed.  I'm not sure how they came up with ""Extra Bold"" in the name, but I found it relatively weak.  I ended up drinking a couple, saving one or two for potential guests that might like weaker, smoother blends and gave the rest away."
17467,B0045Z6K50,A3QX821NK7QSGQ,12/2/11,0,1,2,Not so Extra Bold as stated,"My standard for a good cup would be Green Mountains Extra Bold Expresso which has been hard to find for around sixty cents or less a serving so I tried this brand after my friend gave me a cup at the office. My batch was a lot weaker. Not sure if the coffee content was less than my friends batch, but I ended up packing my own Expresso coffee in the K-cup which filled the bill.<br /><br />George S.<br />Oceanside NY"
17468,B0045Z6K50,A2I927UM7KJ6GV,3/18/11,0,1,2,too mild,"i like a darker roast i guess. Its ok, prob would not buy again. i brew it on the middle selection on the keurig, not the full cup."
17495,B0045Z6K50,ALOCJ67KRE6G1,5/5/12,1,1,2,Nothing bold about this flavor,"There is nothing ""extra bold,"" or even ""regular bold"" about this coffee.  On the other hand, if you like your coffee meek and weak, you may well like this.  This comment isn't meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, I'm just stating that this is not ""extra bold"" at all.  If you want your coffee ""slap your face"" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example."
17498,B0045Z6K50,A3T5S5CEEBMVTT,2/28/12,1,1,2,Definitely not my favorite,I have tried quite a few K-Cup products and this one left me longing for something else. It kind of has a burnt taste to it. I have tried Newman's coffee via a McDonald's and it did not taste like this. Overall I was disappointed and have moved on to the likes of Wolfgang Puck. These tend to be a little more smooth.
17503,B0045Z6K50,A35CTQ1GDTOE8S,1/17/12,1,1,2,Definately not a Medium Roast Coffee! Too bold and bitter!,"Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks you'll like this stuff."
17570,B000CMIYWM,A1N528KKQDJLB6,1/1/11,1,4,2,Made my heart pound ?,I bought this tea at Stop and Shop and it clearly has warnings on it but I didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. I don't fancy the flavor of this tea.  Yogi makes a sampler with this one in it.
17623,B000CMIYWC,A1BKHICYQ1RGVI,8/24/12,0,0,2,It's ok...my issue could be something else,"I bought this (herbal) tea for relief from (a couple months of) breathing issues. Thinking that I may have asthma (I've never been diagnosed). At first it was grand, helping my cough, soothing to my throat and chest. Then surprisingly my stomach started to gurgle and I was frequenting the loo, stopped taking things were fine. Finally, last night I tried nettle (2 caps) and some ginger with honey added tea..ahh relief, sleep! Tonight I will try angelica root and see if that helps."
17639,B000IHXML4,A2Z9VE09ZBS4YE,10/6/10,0,0,2,not good enough,i wanted something that had enough meat so my mini schnauzer would want to bite on it however i needed something that could entice him to chew on this rather than my apartment. THis bone was not the solution. There is practically no meat on this bone and after two minutes of chewing he lost interest in it. I threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again.
17641,B000IHXML4,A2JCKLHCJI1DLN,5/10/09,2,4,2,Bone,"I was very disapointed with this item.It does not look like the photo shown,In fact when it came I thought they had made a mistake.The only (good?)thing about this thing is it is indestructable.Make sure it is put away after it has been chewed? on,hitting your toes on this in the middle of the night might cause you to throw it across a room."
17653,B003QWN6B4,A2S5U9OIV6VAKG,1/17/12,4,7,2,Warning - contains Soy,"For those who are looking to avoid soy, this product contains soy lecithin which is not listed in the product ingredients in the Amazon description.  The candy packaging does not indicate ""organic non-GMO soy"" so it likely derives from (as does most soy) genetically modified sources. Soy lecithin is a waste product created when crude soybean oil is ""degummed"". After some searching, found some outstanding chocolate with no soy lecithin - Alter Eco.  This chocolate has a variety of flavors - midnight crunch with quinoa, dark chocolate mint, cacao, etc .  I have tried all three and they are excellent.  I do not think they have a coconut - which is why I bought the Oskri.  Alter Eco is USDA organic, fair trade, vegan, gluten free, soy and GMO free, no chemicals at all, no emulsifies.  Very good - should not be this hard to find food that is pure, simple and has no nasty additives.  Oh,before I read the fine print on the wrapper, I did try this, good flavor, fairly tough and chewy consistency but not bad flavor."
17655,B004A9GIGM,A2BGO838YJ2YO,3/11/11,1,4,2,nice idea but WEAK!,"First, I'll give the manufacturer some credit for making a no-additive, sucralose-only product. The problem with this product is: it's just too weak, in flavor that is. 1 gram of this ""pure sucralose"" tastes about as strong as 1 gram of a Splenda packet, for comparison.<br />If you don't mind spending a lot for a little bit of pure sucralose taste, then maybe this is for you, but cost-conscious customers might want to look elsewhere for a no-carb, non-calorie sweetener."
17665,B002VAU9DU,AEBNDH4XLB81V,3/10/10,0,0,2,Weak,This coffee was extremely weak and did not taste well. I do not recommend wasting your money on it.
17691,B002VAUBII,A1SMFZ8HH136LG,1/6/10,5,7,2,Nasty After Taste,"I had been using Green Mountain MILK Hot Chocolate, which is good (my kids love it), but weak for a true chocoholic like myself. I thought since I like dark chocolate in general, I would try the DARK Hot Chocolate. Thankfully, I only bought a small quantity because it has a really nasty after taste to it that lingers. I'm going to stick with my weak milk hot chocolate and just make a smaller cup."
17714,B003YBJ9JA,A2SWVRWMDLGOHM,2/5/12,0,0,2,Too much sugar,"My baby likes it but I think it's too much sugar. It's made from concentrate, so it tastes artificial. Try fruitables instead. It has vegetable and fruit juices, less sugar, and tastes much better. Good price on Amazon."
17727,B000LKTSZ2,AFQRD8UY20DJ7,7/27/11,1,1,2,Disappointingly thick and crunchy,"What I like about wafers is the lightweight effect. Thought these would be similar to Manner wafers, with many exceedingly thin layers, however they are very different. The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper-thin. In addition, the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air, so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor, they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members don't like them either, so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again."
17751,B000Z978SS,A221XWNYJZX863,9/4/10,6,9,2,Overhyped and rather tasteless,"I decided to purchase this product based on a blog by one of the<br />supplement oriented doctors on the internet, hyping erythritol as<br />superior to xylitol, which I use regularly and find the closest<br />to sugar in taste with almost no aftertaste and no side effects<br />to my knowledge.  The problem I find with erythritol is its lack<br />of flavor.  On cereal, I barely notice any real sweetness, even<br />when I put as much as a tablespoon and a half on a normal size<br />bowl.  When I use Ideal, the name of the xylitol brand I use, it<br />has the same sweetness as sugar in the same proportion.  Don't get<br />me wrong, erythritol isn't unpleasant, it just has very little<br />sweetness relative to how much you use.  Not worth the price unless<br />you want just a hint of sweetness compared to what you get with<br />sugar or xylitol."
17755,B000Z978SS,AHRP5S5H6ES4V,2/5/09,2,3,2,Powdered and granulated not interchangeable!,"I bought this expecting the ""powdered"" form as it specified and ended up paying for a product I cannot use. The two, granulated(which this IS) and powdered(which it clearly is NOT) are NOT interchangeable within recipes. I felt like I was tricked into buying the wrong product!"
17761,B000Z978SS,ABOPNPT9833VX,4/30/10,5,11,2,This is the first time I tried Erythritol,"GROSS. Tastes like salty menthol sugar or something. Might be passable if you're hiding it in something you're baking...but for coffee? NAH. If you don't own a dog, use Xylitol, because Xylitol will kill your dog. If you do own a dog, just be a man and either quit sweeteners all together, or enjoy sugar. Unless you have diabetes, the truth is that most of you will try this sweetener, that sweetener, and eventually end up back at sugar. Sugar CRUSHES Erythritol."

17813,B000EVMNO6,A1U79Q8XAN2584,8/30/06,0,15,2,Not for everyone,"Haribo makes a wide range of candies, including some world class goodies, but this is not one of them. The frogs are made of a hard gummi, and are all green except for a thin white layer on the frogs' bellies. You might not recognize them as frogs unless you're told. There is no discernible taste or texture difference between the white and green substances, and in any case, the flavor is unidentified, unidentifiable, and not very good. It definitely is not lime, as advertised. Maybe somebody likes this stuff, but I didn't. I set the bag out at the office after my first sample."
17861,B002Y2QSY4,A29EMQSXN4KYL6,1/4/11,1,1,2,Disappointing,"This was purchased as a ""Warehouse Deal"" and there was a noticable lack of aroma when opening the package.  I do not know if it had just been sitting aroung too long (brew by 3/5/11 on package) or if the lack of flavor/character is normal for this product.  Two stars because it is still drinkable but boring."
17863,B001EQ5PRW,A35OJZH63LRG7I,1/29/10,10,12,2,Not very hot.,I bought this to replace a large container of Schilling red pepper flakes that I bought about a long time ago. The old stuff served me well for cooking and pizza topping over the last decade. When I first tasted the new stuff I was a little disappointed that it was not as hot as the Schilling had been. It also seems to be losing its heat quickly -- there's less heat there than there was when I got it a few months ago.
17866,B001BMDEZY,A20G1KEZ9QZ6Z6,2/15/12,2,2,2,They Taste Like Misflavored Corn Chips,"Ok I bought these, thinking they'd be along the lines of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQX6QK"">Terra Sweet Potato Chips, 1.2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>, just with carrots instead of sweet potatoes. Or maybe like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUZYWQ"">Sensible Portions Veggie Straws Original Sea Salt, 20 Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. These chips taste like odd corn chips. They are very bland, and have only a *hint* of the carrot taste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, they aren't so bad that they are inedible. They just were NOT what I expected.<br /><br />Also, they are greasier than I would prefer.<br /><br />If you're looking for good tasting chips that taste like carrots, I would not recommend these. If you are looking for corn chips that kind of taste like carrots, then maybe these are for you.<br /><br />I still have like 4 bags of these unopened because nobody in my house wants to eat them :-("

It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first."
17880,B001EO653M,AKW867T7C6HF8,3/23/10,4,6,2,Mostly a bag of sugar,"To me it seems like too much sugar, not enough chocolate, a little heavy on the spice. Sugar is the first ingredient. But if not for the sugar problem I wouldn't complain about the spice. I tried adding 1/2 pound of powdered cocoa to the 3 pound bag and it was still too sweet. It's amazing to me how far this is from ""the best hot chocolate ever"" like other reviewers rated. Def try a small bag first to see who you agree with."

But when it arrived it was a huge let down. Maybe if I were to add it to smoothies like some reviewers did I would have liked the taste. But using it as regular peanut butter was my plan. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok, the color a little pale, but all that aside, the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried."
18148,B008ZRKZSM,A14LJM5U5PKCNT,10/21/11,2,4,2,Not a great peanut butter substitute,"I had heard quite a bit about the PB2, and being a lover of peanut butter, I thought I would try it. But, it just didn't do the trick. Taste was not what I like, though the consistency was OK. I prefer Better'n Peanut Butter."
18152,B008ZRKZSM,A1YE8EU6KGQ3Q6,9/5/12,4,8,2,Just know what you're getting,"The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as ""PB2"" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again)."
18155,B008ZRKZSM,A3BMY42WTQRSMQ,3/20/11,2,8,2,Yuck!,This tasted so odd. All I can say is it tasted like aspartame. Gave me an awful headache. And the Chocolate was Worse! Dont waste your money.

I guess for people who like sugar added to peanut butter will like it, but I do not like it. I don't get it take out 85% of the fat and add sugar. Why?? Hopefully waiting for them to take out the sugar."

If it were cheap, maybe I'd force myself to eat it, but there's no way I'm paying a premium for this stuff.  I am trying to find ways to cut back on fat & calories, but this isn't going to be it.

But upon opening the bag it reeked of a very strong chemical smell that completley overpowered any of the sweet smell of nutmeg, I thought it smelled just like insecticide. Was immediately turned off.<br /><br />I went ahead and grated some up. It still smelled awful to me, so I compared it to some preground nutmeg I have in my cupboard for probably at least 8 to 10 years. The preground still smelled great, especially when compared to what I had just grated.<br /><br />So I took about 15 of the nuts and scrubbed them with scrubrush in hot soapy water, rinsed, dried, and then stored in new fresh storage container. They definitely smell some better now, but I am so turned off, I don't know if I can even try to actually use them. Yuck.<br /><br />I'm sorry I wasted my money."

I still haven't used very much of it and I bought it some time ago, and no it didn't go bad (unless it was shipped bad), as it was very subpar when I first got it.  Quite bitter and lacking any maltiness whatsoever (at best it tastes slightly above Lipton bagged tea).  Do yourself a favor and order from teasource.com or uptonteas.com both are far better then this.  Heck even Teavanna is better than this.  Extremely disappointing....can barely make passable sun tea out of it."

I had been used to drinking the Assam from Teaism in DC and was looking forward to buying this variety of Assam in bulk to save money but it ended up being a waste of money. There is no flavor no matter how long you steep it or how much you use. It gets two stars because it does not taste bad, there just is no taste."

I normally drink Twinings Ceylon OP, English Breakfast, or PG Tips, and those are all much more flavorful. Even using twice the tea I don't get as strong or dark a cup with three minutes of steeping. The tea itself looks fine and seems appropriately packaged. Davidson's seems like a great company (check out their website) and has lots of organic and Fair Trade teas, so I'll give them another shot with a different variety."

Perhaps if they wrapped it in an airtight container it could change my opinion but by the time I got it it tasted as if it been lying around gathering dust.

Not the best but very good for the price.  After I ran out I decided to order two more bags of the English Breakfast and Assam Banaspaty.  To my great dissapointment, both are old and flavorless.  It seems like Davidson's did not store them properly.  They become bitter quickly if I brew them long enough to get any flavor out of them and I've resorted to mixing it with other tea just so it isn't a total waste.  The reality, is that I wasted $32 on tea that is only really good for making water brown.  : (<br /><br />The quality control issue and randomness of getting a good batch from Davidson's make it not a good value.  I'd rather pay more to know I'm getting consistent quality and not something that might be a total waste.<br /><br />I was really excited when I first discovered Davidson's because I drink a lot of tea and they have attractive pricing but my second order was such a huge let-down that they've lost me as a customer."

These ""dried"" fruits (more like sopping wet with oil...and not just this brand) are far too oily.  I don't want sunflower oil fruit globs.  It's actually disgusting.  Hate to give something a terrible review, but it's just yuck. I like oil fine, where it belongs (french fries, maybe a salad?), but not in dried fruit.  They've managed to get rid of the sulphur and whatever else just to jam them full of sunflower oil (a preservative).  I'd rather just have the fruit dried, in a fruit drier, or sun dried.  I'd even rather the things just crumble to dust in my mouth than this.  Organic or not, it's just oily junk food."

I bought it to make grow grass seeds for the cats to chew on.I would spray it with bug spray but for the fact that I don't want to poison the cats. I've had some of the soil in planter for 2 months and its still making gnats.  I didn't have that problem with the soil that came with the Chia novelty cat grass seeds and soil.  The Miracle potting mix has a lot of wood chips in it.  I would prefer 100% soil instead of 25% wood chips that cause the gnats.  I guess Potting Mix is different than Potting soil.  I used to sell New Era potting soil that was good dark earth with nothing else added to it. Live and learn.

I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun - that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well.

Thought these would be similar to Manner wafers, with many exceedingly thin layers, however they are very different. The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper-thin. In addition, the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air, so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor, they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members don't like them either, so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again."

I thought it would make an elegant, classical gift; the picture looks all elegant, prettily-packed with a  bow.<br /><br />Well, the box I received looked nothing like the box in the picture. It came in a cheap-looking blue cardboard box with the same inside wrapping you'd find in a McDonald's toy. Worst of all, some of the candies had jack-o-lantern wrapping. That's fine in October, but by New Year's, it looks like old Halloween candy! I couldn't use it as a gift because I didn't want them to think I was giving them leftover Halloween candy.<br /><br />If you're ordering the box for yourself, by all means, go for it. The quality of the candies is just fine. But if you're ordering it to give as a gift, watch out! I think they just ship you the oldest (sometimes out-of-season) box they have.

18760,B001534R00,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,3/30/10,4,5,2,"Celsius ""YES"", but Orange Flavor is a ""NO"" for me","I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts, and have found Celsius brand to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.  Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.<br /><br />Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!<br /><br />Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.<br /><br />I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM"">Celsius, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG"">Celsius, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product."

REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon/lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.  But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.

You get a lot of clear gel bait in one tube and that's about the only good thing I can say.  The gel comes out insanely fast and sloppy and I could never manage to moderate it to a slow and steady release.  Once set, the ants barely even noticed it was there.  If I had to guess, I'd say that maybe 5-10% of the ants coming in and out of my house ever fell for the trap.  Some would just go near it and then walk away.  It managed to kill off a few, but not the colony.  Not even close.  The guy who gave it a 5-star review must not have heard of Combat.  MUCH better bait.  On the plus side, Hot Shot still makes great killing sprays.  But their bait is very disappointing."

Way too astringent for me - yuck.  I've tried various weights and water temps to no avail.  The first steeping is not good, the second is more drinkable for me, 3rd steeping is not worth the effort.<br /><br />I've choked down the first can and a half.  I'm going to gift the 3rd unopened can to someone who might enjoy it more than myself.<br /><br />This tea is so bad I wonder if Rishi is all marketing, packaging, and setting price points to brand a sub-par product and then have a team post positive reviews all over the net.

Cold-pressed, it tastes like end-of-the-day convenience store coffee that has been watered down.  Absolutely terrible.<br /><br />Trying it hot only yields marginally better results.<br /><br />The only reason it got 2 stars from me is because I'm impressed with the Krups process.  However, I still cannot fathom why a great manufacturer, Krups, chose to partner up on this project with an instant coffee company (Nescafe).  This flavor is the worst so far BY far."

As with another reviewer of Libby vegetables, I have found significantly dented cans all secured and packaged upon delivery. It does not appear to be damage sustained in Amazon's packing or shipping. (I finally got around to cleaning my pantry to unpack and store my veges when I saw large side dents in four of the 12 cans.) These cans must have been packed dented at Libby's because the dented cans were not even noticeable until they were removed from their original cases. As a result of this damage, I no longer am subscribing to these canned goods on line. I don't save anything when there is a possibility of being poisoned. Sorry Amazon, you need to be aware that you are selling Libby's damaged products. I have to buy locally so I can be sure the cans are not dented and the food inside safe to consume.  It's nice that some customers did not get dented cans, but, I did get them in several cases."

19543,B000084ETV,A105BOR5D5S7CJ,2/25/09,0,0,2,"After feeding for 5 years, we're done","We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com."
19544,B000084ETV,A21DU12R94VZP5,2/19/09,0,0,2,Another bad reaction. Why risk it?,"We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?"

Now he's a mess digestively.  I'm on an email discussion group for greyhounds and have seen lots of complaints as well as confirmation that the formula has changed.  Definitely not working for my dog anymore.  Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for.  I know everyone's hurting financially, but I think in this case the dogs got sold down the river for a few bucks.  Disappointing."

That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it ""Canidae"" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip"

Sometimes it doesn't work at all.  Other times it works like a charm.  When it works like a charm, it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well."

I was disappointed with the plastic after taste and smell as well as watery flavor. the k cups do not have instruction of cup size. Not a good experience for me. keurig has discussed on their site that they are working on an alternate packaging that would also be recyclable. Until then I'll make it in the pot."

All you who would like to be thin, I can recommend the IBS diet--as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal), no dairy, no nuts, no chocolate, no caffeine, no decaf, limit wheat flour, no red meat, no heavy meals, no empty stomach, and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.<br /><br />This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.  They add $1.47 for shipping, but even so, that's a much better price than Amazon's offering here. If you like these, or have a lot of kids and family who do, you may want to check out that source."

It was only $5 so I figured I would try it. When I did, wow, it was amazing! The best chai I've ever had. I looked all over for other cans but couldn't find any. I eventually it at William and Sonoma but it was $10 more and tasted slightly different; less sweet. Anyway, I decided to order the Tiger Spice thinking it would be just as good. I WAS WRONG! It was horrible! It tasted like it had an artificial sweetener in it (my opinion). The texture of the powder was also different from previous David Rio teas I had purchased. Unlike previous teas that had a sugary crystal like texture, this one was very powdery; a fine powder.<br /><br />I will try my luck with some of the other David Rio products but definitely not the Tiger Spice Chai.

After all, they love the Cesars food. However, the treats are far from gourmet as the packaging, price, and picture would suggest. In fact, they're really no different than the run-of-the-mill soft dog treats that you can buy for half the price. One thing I always loved about the Cesars line is that their dog food actually smells palatable. It doesn't just have a meat-like aroma but a meaty aroma...a big difference. The same difference in quality can't be found in the treats though. Upon opening, I was at once overcome by a strong, acrid and chemical-like aroma. Upon examining the treat up-close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it. I gave the package to a neighbor who feeds her dogs Ol' Roy treats which resemble these in texture and smell and they loved them. Nothing wrong with Ol' Roy btw...but why pay three times the price for the same thing?"
20279,B001BDDTB2,AF74UAKV3Q3W0,12/15/08,0,0,2,The cats weren't impressed!,"When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!"

Of course my cats loved it and each devoured a whole can. I felt it was quite overpriced for tuna and will not purchase again. I think it's much more cost-effective to buy a can of Phillip's crab meat from the grocery store so my cats and I can both enjoy it."

I was sure my cat would like it because it came in those cute little cans. She does like the can and she'll meow and whine until it's opened. Once in her bowl, she'll lap up the broth and then grudgingly eat the chunks of meat but the smaller ones have to be dumped. I'm signed up for a shipment once every six months but I'll have to rethink that. It was supposed to be a treat for her but if she doesn't like it, it isn't much of a treat. You think?"
20379,B001BDDTB2,ACQB8FMHUZSY3,12/17/08,0,1,2,Uh-oh,"Okay, the bottom line for this food is that my cat, Buster, wouldn't eat it.  He LOVES canned cat food usually, but is 13 1/2 years old and rather finicky now.  He likes just about any kind of Fancy Feast, though once in a while, being a cat, he will turn up his nose even at that.<br />But I couldn't get him to do more than lick some of the gravy off the first serving I gave him of these chicken-flavored items. Subsequent offerings were met with the floor-scratching response (cat owners usually know this, but the cat is using the same gesture he uses in the litter box, effectively saying ""This stuff is c***!"").<br />My friends who have cats don't give them canned food - so I have most of this stuff left in my basement awaiting a hungry, interested feline consumer.<br />The product is made in Thailand, which is too close to China for my comfort, anyway.  We all know about recent deaths and problems with Chinese-made pet food (and baby formula!) ingredients.  I considered not using this product at ALL once I noticed it was from Thailand.<br />But Buster made the call, so I didn't have to."
20381,B001BDDTB2,AT96TYI24GKXH,12/16/08,0,1,2,Mostly Just Sauce,"The variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food. Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out. it seems to be little square bite size (for cats) pieces of a chicken-like item, in a broth, mostly broth. Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the ""soup"" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it). And frankly, even with the manufacturer's recommendation of what would amount to 6 or more cans a day for my larger 12 lb cat, just not enough food there to satisfy him, mostly liquid.<br /><br />Chinese Chicken: Once again, fairly saucy, but with a much higher meat:sauce ratio, with what looked like a fair amount of shredded chicken. Once again, my picky eater just lapped up the sauce, and my other big guy, who eats anything, really was not interested, no matter how hungry he was.<br /><br />And please tell me why there are little tiny chunks of carrots in each of these? Cats have no interest in carrots, do they have some need for Vit A that is not fulfilled in the supplementation of this food? I doubt it, that is in there for us humans... stupid.<br />I gave this two stars instead of one, because one of my cats quite liked the sauce."
20382,B001BDDTB2,A105S56ODHGJEK,12/16/08,0,1,2,Good... If your cat will actually eat it.,"I have to admit, it's nice that Petite Cuisine doesn't have the standard nasty canned cat food smell to it. It actually looks and smells decent, compared to the stuff I'm used to. It also has an overall healthier list of ingredients than most canned cat foods. Normally, that would add up to a five-star meal. The problem is, our cat won't eat the stuff! Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff! Overall a disappointing experience on this end, but it's worth a try because every cat is different. You may find that it suites your cat's tastes just fine."

One cat is part Maine Coon and weighs about 28lbs, one is 17-years with a thyroid condition and constantly wants to eat, the third is the Coon's twin and she is a bit of a glutton.  ANyway, each of these cans has about the equivalent of two tablespoons of food and the rest is all liquid.  That was a reall turnoff for my guys.  The actual protein content LOOKS good, but they all three pretty much turned their noses up at it.  I have been using it as my ""emergency supply"" but have to say, I would never buy."

Wrong. the Raspberry and Irish Creme keep piling up because I don't like them. But some reviewers have given me a few ideas. I merely tolerate the hazelnut and vanilla. Love the caramel and chocolate. What I would really like is to be able to select my own sugar free variety pack and or be able to purchase one that has coconut (my absolute fav), white chocolate, almond, caramel, peppermint, and gingerbread syrup (I am addicted to this flavor).

To compare, i have just finished a caribou blend box, a newmans organic dark roast box, etc. I tend to like a medium strength coffee and i find the darker roasts work better for me-i tried the tullys black with sugar, and immediatly got this burnt cigarette aftertaste- long time coffee drinkers know this taste-ugh. I havent gotten this aftertaste with the other brands. I tried the tullys again, with milk and sugar, which is my usual preparation-i thought this might mask that flavor, but i can still taste it. I am dissatisfied with this brand, and i wont buy it again, too much wasted money with the boxes being 10 bucks each."

The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs."

I think it is all according to your taste and what you are expecting for this price. I ordered packets from two different web sites and they both taste ok just like a frosty/rich shake ordered from a drive thru window. It was ok but I wouldn't pay the price for it again. I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix."

The packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn't help when giving as gifts.  Saved 2 packages for our family Christmas Eve treats. I can't say they are horrible but it tasted like any old chocolate shake.  It has a very strong chocolate taste so I added more milk to tame the taste.  These are pretty exprensive so we expected better.

The packaging needs improvement.  The dal looks OK, tho I haven't cooked it up yet.<br /><br />QUANTITY INCORRECT/UNIT PRICING:  The product which arrived was ONE 64-ounce pouch, NOT a pack of four 64-ounce pouches, which is what the website said:  ""Spicy World Chana Dal, 64-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4).""  This makes it $5.72/pound, not $1.42/pound.  Amazon should correct this and should post the price per pound or per ounce for grocery items, like the stores do - ""unit pricing.""  This would help us compare prices on these items.<br /><br />AMAZON SELLER FEEDBACK:  Because amazon.com is the ""seller"" I can't leave ""seller feedback"" from my order on the amazon website!

I only got very light crema from Lavazza Tierra! also I don't smell any aroma. I tried pulling a shot with a bottomless portafilter, it looks very awful. I think the bean is old."
20786,B000SDMFC0,A51J9JE0EB3GS,8/5/11,2,4,2,Old coffee,So when you purchase beans of a reputable brand you would expect to get fresh beans. They tasted old from the opening of the bag and so even if the date was well in advance of it's expiration I can only surmise that quality control was an issue in the storage or shipping of the beans. But I won't be ordering any more espresso beans from this company unless they can correct this.

The traditional basted American Turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted.  The aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses, exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy.  This cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy, deaden in wine, brown onions and thyme. Maybe the old world tastes are more astute, but my American gravy will remain simply traditional.  The Glace De Volaille Gold Roasted Old World Gravy recipe, well it went into the trash."

I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either."

I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.

Ive always given him the correct size greenie for his weight, and have never had to take him to the vet. (yet I never leave him unattended with his greenie) The only problem I had with this particular seller was the picture on display, and what I recieved in the mail. Please don't make the same mistake I did, there are only 17 greenies in the box, would have been better off buying them at Petsmart."
21541,B002QWP89S,A2974R9BTPZPOJ,1/29/10,11,19,2,Not too thrilled,"I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing."

Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth...  just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie...  that's all."
21548,B002QWP89S,A2YCEKVUN1W5F1,4/18/12,0,2,2,I like Greenies but these are too tiny and snap in half,"I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up."

I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews."

I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago - at the time of this purchase - but have only received 5.<br /><br />First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other brands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others - I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved - I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils."

For reference, I've drank many brands of grape juice from the obvious Welch's to any old store brand.

The rope is not actually a rope, it's a plastic mimic of a rope and my dog can't seem to figure out that he can tug at it like he can his tug rope. He quickly figured out all the other busy buddy toys and the buster cube, so I assume the rope just seems too foreign. I am going to buy an actual tug tope that will fit and try that instead.

I wanted to give her something to stimulate her mind, so she didn't get too bored while I was away. I received many recommendations on this toy, and read many great reviews. Here are my issues with it.<br /><br />1) My dog may only be 16 lbs., but she's an extreme chewer. The product says it's durable, but it's not. She almost had it chewed through by day one.<br /><br />2) Apparently, my dog is a genius. She figured out how to dispense the treats, just not the way they're supposed to be dispensed. She unraveled the rope. Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.<br /><br />I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats. For extreme chewers, and smart dogs, it's not durable or stimulating enough for them."

She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough.  When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces.  While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does.  Especially for eleven dollars!"
21925,B000KV61FC,A1W67NB503WVQ9,10/4/12,0,0,2,Not a great toy for chewers,"I think my dog was just too smart for this toy.  I purchased one of the larger ones with the rubber rope.  After 5 minutes of frustration in trying to get the treats out, my dog chewed through the rubber rope so that she could just empty the treats out the hole.  It was a waste of money for my dog to try out.  With the fabric-type rope, the toy might have lasted longer for her."
21930,B000KV61FC,A3RU5LSPGFU5H4,8/16/12,0,0,2,Destroyed in a day and a half,"I bought this for my very smart lab mix rescue when she was about 6 months old. At first she wasn't interested, but once I showed her how it worked, she got down to business. She worked at that toy all day long the first day, thougth she wasn't able to get all the food out. On the second day I gave her the toy, partially filled with kibble and went upstairs. In the 25 minutes she was unsupervised, she got the screw cap off, ate all the kibble, and destroyed the bottle."

21959,B000KV61FC,A2MNPMBXU9062C,12/14/11,0,0,2,Not Durable,The item was delivered here in great condition. My 5 month old American Eskimo likes the tug a jug even without any treats or kibble inside. But after a few uses a small piece of the bottom lid chipped off. My puppy didn't even play roughly with it. It could have been dangerous if he ate it. Luckily I was there.
21964,B000KV61FC,A19XONKTYV8AKZ,11/21/11,0,0,2,Needs to be stronger,"I have two boxers, male and female. After about 30 minutes of the expected use, the male grabbed the end of the rope, shook and shattered the plastic threaded bottom right off the bottle against the corner of a door frame.<br /><br />Concept is intriguing for the dogs but the plastic is too brittle. They didn't have the toy long enough to get to chewing on the rubber ball at the end."
21966,B000KV61FC,A7KILT6HJ133G,10/17/11,0,0,2,Fragile bottom splits easily,"My dog loves the tug-a-jug. I've bought three of them and on all of them the bottom has split. The bottom edges and threads split and break off. My dog isn't particularly hard on the toy either, it's only used on the carpet and she doesn't swing it around into walls or furniture. She stands it up, knocks it over and drags it by the rope along the floor with her paws. I really want to recommend this product, but I can't afford to replace it every three to five uses."
21967,B000KV61FC,A2WCB04X1TTSDS,10/16/11,0,0,2,Broken Tooth,"Our dachshund LOVED this jug!  But once she really learned how to do it she wound up doing it so hard<br />that the jug would slam back and hit her.  She didn't apparently mind that but it broke her right canine tooth. Hence, this cost us $2500 for a route canal!!!"
21971,B000KV61FC,A3QTNS815YRIA7,9/20/11,0,0,2,Busy Buddy,"Ughh ..l I tried getting a toy for my puppy to play with to dispense treats.. it worked for a day.. my puppy was slammimg this jug around .. and the treats would dispense out .. he whipped it around he loved it ..but it cracked on the bottom and that's that.. so out of commission .. but nosey if you do not have and carpets or rugs in your home.. i have hard wood floor .. it was loud and nosey ,which was ok for a few minutes but then, i had to take it away .. good idea but my pup is 3 months old  pitbull/german shepard mix.. he is active so now i ihave to shop for another treat dispenser.. i will submit a video of what i am talking about .. i just purchased another toy I will tell you how it goes .. i ordered the squirrel that dispenses treats i heard it was strirdy !!"
21985,B000KV61FC,A3PWMZX1Y9OY2,6/27/11,0,0,2,Brain vs. Brawn,"So I am the proud owner of an almost 80-lb. 1-year-old lab mix whose sole mission in life is to seek and destroy.  I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size.  I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it.  This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart.  However, he may be too smart.  Gave it to my dog tonight.  It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied.  I walked away to leave him to his work.  10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle.  He cheated.  This had potential to be an awesome, time-consuming toy to same some of my sanity.  Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money."
21987,B000KV61FC,A3QI0HE04BR0RW,6/27/11,0,0,2,Plastic can crack from a strong  chewer,"I have a three-year old lab/chessie mix. She's a fast eater and a strong chewer so I bought her the Tug-A-Jug to slow down her eating (and give her something to chew on).<br /><br />It does slow her down. It can take her up to a half hour to eat a meal instead of two minutes.<br /><br />I've given her food a couple of times without the bottle, but she prefers the bottle now.<br /><br />Updated section!<br /><br />As she become a strong chewer, it's fairly easy for my dog to chew off the bottom part that's screwed on. This leads to the possibility of her swallowing a sharp piece of plastic.<br /><br />It's a great toy, but only for dogs that aren't extremely strong chewers. My dog loved this, but it's too much of a safety hazard for her to have again."
21992,B000KV61FC,A2WE3BMGEFP7V9,6/6/11,0,0,2,"If it's hard for ME to get the treats out, I don't think my dog's going to have much luck.","I was really rooting for this toy to work out, because my Frenchie Tobias loves playing with plastic bottles and he loves treats. The Tug a jug should be the perfect combo, right? The one I purchased had the rope, not the rubber thing. In theory, when you tip the toy treats should fall out relatively easily, according to various instructions and videos I found through internet searches. But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.<br /><br />He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.<br /><br />I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part. He did leave scratches all over it, but hasn't yet managed to crack it. However, I think it's only a matter of time."
21996,B000KV61FC,A7T3EGPBVMO6Y,4/26/11,0,0,2,Not For A Strong Chewer,We bought the large one for our dog thinking it was a neat idea to keep him occupied (and it is a really good idea for a toy) but apparently our 20lb dog has jaws of steel because the plastic broke the first time he played with it. He's not not a monster dog by any means but this just couldn't hold up to my dog.
21998,B000KV61FC,A2L11XFJ1W0AV1,4/24/11,0,0,2,not worth it,I have yet to figure out how to get the bottom off to place treats into the toy. So I put them into the top which was difficult and they are hard for the dogs to get out. There are better toys than this one.
22000,B000KV61FC,A3FPJDEDIX7HIT,3/28/11,0,0,2,"Clever idea, but...","The rope is made of rubber, and after about 30 minutes my little 20 lb. terrier had chewed up the rope, thereby eliminating the ""tug"" part of the toy. I wouldn't be surprised if she ingested some of it. For $10, this toy needs a more durable rope."
22008,B000KV61FC,A2CZ9R1CAU7S9I,1/17/11,0,0,2,No Match for a Boxer,"My 3 yr old 75lb boxer is a heavy chewer and has a really long attention span to toys that give him a challenge. So at first this seemed like a promising toy.  It lasted maybe one week before my boxer figured out that picking it up in his mouth then dropping, no slamming, it on my hardwood floor gets pieces of food out. The end cap, which screws on and is plastic, never stood a chance. it broke off and I was able to screw it on once more before bits of plastic shards were on my floor and victory was his.<br /><br />It now sadly sits in the dogs toy box he doesnt like it anymore now that it doesnt dispense treats. lol. I wish I could get my money back or get a new plastic screw cap for it."
22010,B000KV61FC,AWN3KOKDIDN0P,1/11/11,0,0,2,Quickly spills out the treats,My 12 month old lab puppy can grasp the bottle in her mouth and shake out all of the treats.  It took her less than a minute to figure this out and eat all of the treats.  I was very disappointed in this dog toy.
22012,B000KV61FC,AL8WV8BE0ISZQ,1/8/11,0,0,2,Can be dangerous,"I have purchased many Premier brand products and liked them, especially the Busy Buddy dog toys.  However, the Tug-a-jug is not one of them.  The treats do not dispense as easily as some of their other products so some dogs may get discouraged.  My dog stopped playing with it due to that.  The  tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass.  If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by.  It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges.  Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that!  I did buy it in 2009 but my dog hardly ever played with it so I am not sure how long they would last if a dog played with it frequently.  Premier has so many other wonderful dog toys to chose from."
22017,B000KV61FC,ARCMU0E7A8HNP,12/26/10,0,0,2,Did not last long.,"The container itself is very strong, but our 40 lb springer spaniel chewed the rope apart in less than 15 minutes so she could get all of the treats."
22026,B000KV61FC,A7DX7BMWACQPS,9/24/10,0,0,2,frustrating,"This toy is very frustrating, for a dog and for the owner. It makes my dog rather hyper and makes her bark too much. There's nothing wrong with the manufacture of the toy; I just don't think it works well as a device to keep a dog happily busy."
22031,B000KV61FC,AFN2DFCI8ZTHZ,8/28/10,0,0,2,"Great concept, but my dogs find little interest in it","It's a sturdy jug and easy to fill with treats.  My dogs, however, do not find it interesting and have spent little to no time playing with it."
22065,B000KV61FC,ALIL6GECW4VE1,10/2/07,6,7,2,Good idea... my dogs are not interested.,"I don't know.  Maybe I'm just not putting the right ""yummy goodness"" inside.  This toy, though durable and a novel idea, doesn't hold either of my dogs' interest.  Not even our beagle (who tells everyone she's STARVING and we NEVER feed her... EVER!) seems to be interested in this for any length of time."
22066,B000KV61FC,A3W37DL6P9WZHC,10/4/08,3,3,2,Nothing special,"This product seems to be torturous for my dog.  She sees the treats inside, but being such a small dog, even the ""small"" sized bottle is too big for her to thrash around and get the treats out. I love how busy it keeps her, but in the end, I have to take a treat or two out for her because she can't do it on her own.  Probably better for bigger dogs."
22081,B000KV61FC,A2HT1DKZARTZPC,12/4/09,0,0,2,"Cool, but my dog quickly destroyed it","I wanted to use this as an alternative to a Kong, to fill with lunch for my dog on days when she would be alone all day while I was at work, and my husband was out of town. The product arrived with a rubber ""rope"" with a ball-like bulge on the outside, and a cone-shaped plug on the inside, rather than the actual rope pictured on the page. For the first 3 days, it was wonderful. She was very excited and interested in how it worked, and it seemed to keep her occupied. On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber ""rope"". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat. I would only recommend this product if your dog is a VERY weak chewer."
22083,B000KV61FC,A2MXME0QLYZB67,7/23/09,0,0,2,"The ""rope"" is actually rubber. Chewed through it in seconds.",The rope part of the toy that the dog is supposed to tug on to get the treats out is rubber and not rope as shown in the product pocture. My 45lb border collie mix chewed through that in almost record time.<br /><br />He really likes the toy. He just picks it up now by the knobby top and drops it to get the treats out. I will probably try to put an actual rope and stopper in to fix it. I am just disappointed that it wasn't as shown.
22118,B000KV61FC,A3CIFBFBMY5GEU,5/12/08,3,5,2,Use a Plastic Coke Bottle Instead,"So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out.  So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle."
22121,B000KV61FC,A23FG04WAXU8WQ,6/7/12,1,2,2,Too much for pup,I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him.  He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.
22125,B000KV61FC,A1ITKSZ9ZQFTGK,4/12/12,1,2,2,"Great Toy, Impossible to Clean","Purchased this for my 3 year old Dalmatian who suffers from separation anxiety and boredom when my husband and I leave for work.  We put his breakfast in the Tug-A-Jug, and he went from howling when we left, to happily chasing his toy around to get his food.  He isn't a major chewer, but has ripped things up in the past.  This toy shows some minor scratches (we've had it for about 6 months), but they are all cosmetic-nothing structural.  So that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news?  The rope gets super smelly.  Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.  For me, this is too much work.  We're ordering a kong to see if we can save on some of the clean up time."
22129,B000KV61FC,A2T89T26FO5Q8J,9/4/11,1,2,2,Not for a large puppy or chewer,"I bought this for my 6 month old lab puppy. He figured out how to get the treats and it was his favorite entertainment. However, he swung it around from the rope (it's made to do that) and within weeks had broken the plastic top by hitting it against the floor so it could no longer be used. For a $20 item, I expect longer use, and to have plastic shards around a puppy is just dangerous! Great toy/food dspenser in thoery, but just too fragile!"
22131,B000KV61FC,A1FHXN6HBHVZ8E,5/30/11,1,2,2,Great idea - poor quality rope,"Well this certainly didn't last long with my german shepard mix puppy.  It less than an hour she had shredded the rope, splitting it into two pieces.  Once the knot in the jug dropped to the bottom she was able to empty all the treats quickly.  I used it again with larger treats inside and no rope.  That worked for about 20 minutes until she ripped the nub coating off the neck of the bottle and started crushing the neck portion.  I had to take it away and toss it, getting only 2 uses and less than 2 hours out of it."
22132,B000KV61FC,A1OA06LPHX3HGG,5/21/11,1,2,2,Broke the first time it was used,"I wanted to like this item and had seen the generally favorable reviews.  I loaded it with some liver treats and opened our front door to offer it to my dog-- she grabbed the rope and released it...and it fell about two feet onto the step and cracked!  I was pretty surprised it took that little to break it.  The crack was on the screw-in bottom so it spread and basically the bottom broke and it was useless...back to Amazon, sorry!  Maybe a rubber guard for the bottom would make this a better product?"
22138,B000KV61FC,AHZR11DB40FG4,2/14/10,1,2,2,I was frustrated watching her try to get the treats!,"I was very excited when the Tug-a-Jug arrived.  I was looking for new toys to keep my 1 1/2 yr old Lhasa busy.  This did keep her busy.  It kept her busy trying to get at the treats that she could see and smell without any reward.  The treats only come out when I turn it upside down and play with the rope.  I felt bad watching her trying to get the treats, and she tried so hard for such a long time. There is no way she would be able to turn it upside down.  It is also SO loud.  We had to take it off her the first day because my husband and I could not hear each other talking!  It was a waste of money. We will stick with Kong dispensers."
22139,B000KV61FC,A2SH39LS6LNTO3,2/5/10,1,2,2,Busy Buddy Tug a Jug,"This toy does not entice my pet at all.  I am ""underwhelmed"" and actually regret purchasing it.  I could have spent my money better purchasing nylabones which my pet loves."
22141,B000KV61FC,A1GT5JFPQPT8AC,2/2/10,1,2,2,Too heavy and only for food motivatewd dogs,"I bought this based on a friend's recommendation, but was disappointed.<br /><br />Although I checked the sizing chart, the item seemed too big and heavy for my dog. I recommend going one size down from what they recommend.<br /><br />Also - although my dog loves playing with her stuff-a-ball toy, she will barely go near this thing. So - the one doesn't necessarily imply like for this item.<br /><br />I suspect this would work best for a dog with strong food motivation. My doesn't like it at all.<br /><br />As a toy, it's not much fun, unless a dog really wants food badly and is willing to put a lot of work into it."
22147,B000KV61FC,A1XIGRUJRVVG58,10/15/09,1,2,2,Not Lab durable...,My 7 month old lab mastered the toy in about an hour.  He managed to chew through the rope and render this toy about as useful as a gatorade bottle with no top.
22148,B000KV61FC,A2QZHU6R7UE8ZI,10/14/09,1,2,2,NOT for tough chewers!!!,"We have a lab who is a TOUGH chewer...this lasted about a week.<br /><br />I got the first one with the rope top, and our dog chewed through the rope in 5 minutes and had the purple ball off in another 10 minutes. I made the mistake of using Gorilla Glue to put it back on, then realized that its really bad for dogs so threw that one away.<br />Ordered another one--this time with the rubber rope--and our dog was through the rope in about 20 minutes, again got the purple ball off in another 10 minutes, and went to work on the neck of the bottle. A week later we had to toss it because he had chewed off the neck of the bottle and it was cracked all down the sides.<br />He did LOVE it while he had it...but $10 for a week of entertainment is a bit much..."
22154,B000KV61FC,A3SKIW3YE18RBT,2/16/09,1,2,2,Too smelly? Dog won't touch it.,"Despite several washings, I can not get rid of the industrial plastic smell on the soft rubber parts of this toy, and our dog (lab mix) has absolutley no interest in it, despite favorite treats inside. I can only assume she finds the smell offensive/repellant.<br /><br />If she does ever take an interest in it (I keep trying), I will keep a close eye on the rubber ""rope""- seems like something she may chew through fairly quickly."
22155,B000KV61FC,ARNGEQEP7G56U,12/2/08,1,2,2,Don't understand the problem,"My one year old boxer is a big goofy, playful dog.  He adores chewing on water bottles, stuffed toys, milk bones, you name it.  I really thought this toy would be a terrific idea for him but he is absolutely terrified of it.  He growls and barks at it, won't even smell it.  Sounds terrific to me but I guess if you're considering this toy you should probably bring your pup to a pet store to introduce him to it first."
22157,B000KV61FC,A24WL4AZ1SXTZF,12/8/07,1,2,2,Not all dogs love it,"I bought this because of all the great reviews, but unfortunately neither one of my two dogs were at all interested."
22158,B000KV61FC,A20RTZ6I5ADGRL,8/14/07,2,4,2,Expected more...,"I bought this for my Puggle (Pug/Beagle mix) because he loves to chew on empty soda bottles. The bottle part is very tough, but he had the rope part destroyed within an hour. I expected more from it than that. Without the rope, it's just not the same. I consider this to have been a waste of money."
22162,B000KV61FC,A1N2UHFTS2KP33,7/5/12,0,1,2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"My 10 month old Golden Doodle had chewed through the rope within 30 minutes.  The ""bottle"" part is hard plastic and very loud when bounced around.  The knot on the rope (when we still had a rope) fit too tightly into the opening making getting treats out of the bottle close to impossible.  I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more.  And for the price, think the rope would have been somewhat tougher to a chewer like mine.<br />If your dog is a chewer I can't recommend this.  Not what I expected or hoped for....."
22166,B000KV61FC,A1BEMKOWN1TJK4,4/13/12,0,1,2,"Good idea, dog enjoyed it, broke immediately",Our dog enjoyed this for 10 minutes and the bottom broke. The part that screws in the bottom cracked. I'm very disappointed.
22178,B000KV61FC,A877WMJ8EME9X,1/24/12,0,1,2,Dog won't touch it!,"I have a 7 pound miniature poodle, and she is terrified of this toy. She tugged it a couple of times when we first gave it to her, but it made so much noise she has never messed with it again. I have tried to get her to play with it, but as soon as I get her to tug it, she gets scared. I think she feels like the bottle is following her. Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue. Most of all I would just say this toy is probably not for dogs that have a more timid tendency or are scared of loud sounds."
22185,B000KV61FC,A17YPMCHJ10PEZ,12/2/11,0,1,2,Good while it lasted ... but it didn't last!,"I started feeding my chocolate lab his dinner in this toy and it worked well.  I really enjoyed watching him figure out how to dump this kibble out and he seemed to enjoying the challenge of getting every last piece out.  He took to picking up the empty jug and dropping it, as if to ask for more food ... and after 3 or 4 instances of this, the lid broke.<br /><br />If the lid were better protected from this type of damage I would definitely buy another one.  It's not dog proof enough for us."
22187,B000KV61FC,A1GVVDWW9MWRFG,10/18/11,0,1,2,Nice toy but our Vizsla puppy is just not interested,"Another love it or hate it toy.... It's a bottle, it's a spiky ball, it's a rope, it's a treat dispenser! Apparently, the choices are too overwhelming for our Vizsla puppy because she passes this one up. In addition, the hard plastic bottle makes a racket on our hard kitchen floor, so maybe it's a blessing after all :)"
22189,B000KV61FC,A3RLO7U7WA53LB,9/15/11,0,1,2,Plastic Is Not Durable Enough for a Dog Toy,"My dog really likes this toy, and it occupies him for quite a while. The big problem is that the plastic cracks at the top where the lid screws on if it dropped on the floor. My dog is Jack Russell, so he's not dropping it from a very high height, yet it still breaks, so I can't imagine it with a larger dog. We have returned this toy twice, and already the third on is pretty much unusable."
22191,B000KV61FC,A1OO934ZB172BG,8/25/11,0,1,2,"Good concept, brittle plastic","I bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. My dog loved it, but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one. Good concept but plastic too brittle. Company does stand behind it, just not good for my dog."
22192,B000KV61FC,A1RN9FGWEUHDPS,8/11/11,0,1,2,Dogs not interested,"My dog are so uninterested in this that it might as well be invisible.  I even put liver treats in it and tried to show them how to play with it.  Neither dog would bother with it at all. (One is Female 4 yr old greyhound/lab/shephard mix, other is female 4 month old lab/border collie mix - both are very playful & love treats)<br />Very disappointed."
22195,B000KV61FC,A2OL546DEHMANA,5/10/11,0,1,2,Hard Plastic,"This is made out of hard plastic. I bought this for my Shepherd that loves to chew. She's not interested in playing with it at all. It's made to be a educational for dogs,  I guess she just got bored with it. On the plus side your human kiddos will like it."
22197,B000KV61FC,A34GJ3Z9HPKXL2,3/9/11,0,1,2,The lid cover broke within 5 minutes,"I thought this dog toy would perfectly fit my 11 month Samoyed and provide the durable playful time. Unfortunately, my Samoyed was not just rolling the bottle, her chewing on the knots caused the bottle to fly around and when it hits my fragile ceramic floor, it broke (both the lid cover and my newly set floor).. *sigh*<br />Maybe this product should be used in a carpeted environment only."
22198,B000KV61FC,A27F8IL8F7F3BD,3/9/11,0,1,2,Not for a smaller dog,"This gizmo is HUGE!  If it weren't so much trouble I'd send it back.  Looks like a great product for a St. Bernard, but for my 13-pound Shih Tzu it's overkill.  There may be a smaller version, but I can only imagine what the hard plastic would sound like on my tile floors!"
22199,B000KV61FC,A33ONOZAT1DP8P,3/4/11,0,1,2,didn't last long,"My pup and I really enjoyed this in the beginning.  She very quickly learned how to hold the rope with one paw and tip the bottle with the other to get food out.  We were starting to learn some other things (adding balls inside to change how the food fell out, etc).  Screwing the cap on was always difficult, with it needing to be lined up exactly right.  Soon, however, the threads broke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the ""cap"" on.  Now it is useless."

Within one week, she broke the cap into 3 pieces anf got all the kibble, Superglued it back together which lasted another week.<br /><br />I would not purchase again.  I went for the hard plastic Kong that dispense hard kibble.  They have barely scratched it although they can get the food out more quickly.  I throw larger treats in to slow dispensing action."
22202,B000KV61FC,A3JV9ZSRZF6MMD,2/18/11,0,1,2,Not recommended for tough chewers,"If your dog isn't a chewer/destroyer-of-toys like mine, this might be fine. But my lab destroyed the rope and ate the plastic stopper very quickly. Also, keep in mind if you live above someone and don't have carpets, the dog will repeatedly drop the bottle on the floor to get the treats out. So had my dog not eaten this toy, I still couldn't have used it very often because it's very loud."
22203,B000KV61FC,A2ABVC0UAKHR89,2/2/11,0,1,2,"Awesome food toy, but not durable at all!","This toy is phenomenal.  It keeps both of our dogs (1 silky terrier, 1 boston terrier) busy, and actually keeps my boston's farting problem at bay (I'm serious).  The only downside is the plastic top that you have to screw off/on to put food into it is NOT durable.  I called customer service and they sent me a new one, but they sounded surprised because the tug-a-jug is apparently made of ballistic plastic (I don't even know what that means).  The 5 jugs I've gone through say otherwise...<br /><br />Note: I will continue to buy these anyways."

The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the ""scent holes"" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately."
22210,B000KV61FC,A1G78GAMWL1AOL,11/11/10,0,1,2,Great--for two days,"My puppy is under 40 pounds, and loved this toy.  He chewed the rope apart in one day.  Well, I unscrewed the bottom and inserted a golf ball.  It did the job of the rope and made it tough to shake out the treats.  Kept the pup occupied for two hours.  Then he figured out that tossing the bottle would shake loose the treats.  the plastic bottle cracked in minutes.<br /><br />This would be an excellent toy if the plastic was tougher.  the design is great, especially with the ball addition."
22216,B000KV61FC,A1SLIK12FO8420,1/20/10,0,1,2,not for a chewer,"My 10 month old Lab needed some brain toys, and this seemed like an ideal option. There is a problem to solve, and the reward is food - what could be better for a Lab? The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope - which also made it way easier to get the food out - she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.<br /><br />And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy - but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total."

I would have, but it was a gift.<br />The first time I left this toy in the crate with my smart, 6 month old blue heeler mix puppy, I came home to find she had somehow managed to unscrew it and eaten all the treats. The second time she played with it all over the house, and the noise drove me crazy. Bang, boom, bang. She kept rolling it down the stairs, off a ledge, and knocking things over when it rolled behind them. But she was thoroughly entertained, so I let it be. The third time she played with it while I was cooking. A few minutes later, I looked down to see she had unscrewed it again, and was chewing on the various pieces happily. I didn't stop her since the brochure said it was virtually indestructible material. When I picked it up a bit later, her chewing had apparently ruined the threading so I could no longer screw the lid back on.

I'm not sure if they're making it with the plastic rope anymore, but I assumed that since that was what was shown, that's what I'd receive.) I'm not really happy with this bait and switch because I have to closely monitor my dog with this toy to make sure she doesn't shred the rope and render it useless."

I tried it with a friends dog four times and the dog could not connect that kibble came out when he let go.  All he wanted to do was tug.  The rope was so stiff he couldn't really get a grip on it and the rope also smelled of chemicals.  Between the BPA in the bottle and cap and the inflexible rope, we found it was unusable and sent it back."

It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions.  I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy.  They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought.  AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes.  It's a good idea but I wouldn't recommend this toy...they need to work out some kinks first and/or up the quality of this product."

You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!"

Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online."
22435,B004EJVWGY,A3SDXIOLSPVVHJ,7/2/12,0,0,2,Strange chemical peach flavor - is this natural?,"I'm almost on the fence with this one, but more body weight is leaning toward the ""no"" side.  The tea-leaf flavor itself is quite nice - the subtle flavor of South Carolina's black tea is interestingly different from what I drink on a daily basis, and I like that change every once in a while. Also, the tea leaves seem very fresh.  I like the Governor Grey and Breakfast teas for a simple, linear-tasting black tea, but there are still other brands I gravitate toward for more complexity (Mighty Leaf has a wonderful Earl Grey with stronger bergamot flavor).  The problem with this particular tea is that the peach flavoring is strange and sometimes reminds me of chemically scented plastic (a warning sign of artificial flavoring).  I did double-check to make sure the ""peach flavor"" mentioned in the ingredient list is natural, and the website for the Charleston Tea Plantation affirms that a natural essential oil is used in all of their teas, but the peach tastes so chemical compared to other, more natural teas I've had - you know, the teas that have visible bits of fruit in it.  When I checked the reviews on the Charleston Tea Plantation website, I noticed that someone else had left a review mentioning the same chemical taste.  This tea is refreshing and easy to drink, but I just can't get over the weird peach aftertaste that lingers just a bit too long and too strongly.  Maybe it's just a personal preference (many other people seem to love this tea), but I'm going to stick with Green Hill Tea's peach apricot loose tea because it is much better, and the ingredients seem better (taken from their website: black tea, natural dried papaya, freeze dried peach + apricot, blackberry leaves, sunflower + calendula petals, natural flavours)."

I hate, hate, hate how they put Stevia into it. If I want my tea sweeter, allow me to put my own sweetener in it. Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea, but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird, not yummy, sweet taste. I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is, but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink, I use conventional sugars that don't taste terrible.<br /><br />It does give a bit of a relaxing feel, but the Stevia really ruins it.

And I wasn't really expecting authentic Vietnamese Pho noodles with this item, but it wasn't even remotely close to resembling that or any other Asian noodles.  I guess it's a matter of individual taste and preference with these things.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste good either.  Not a lot of flavor, and what little flavor it did have I wouldn't describe as Vietnamese (or even Asian for that matter).<br /><br />I've also read a few reviews describing the portions as big, but it definitely was not.

There are also separate small bags for the liquid flavoring and dehydrated vegetables.  This is a high quality product but for my personal tastes, it was simply too bland and delicate.  I did not enjoy this soup but will definitely try the other flavors.  The Korean kimchi had much more flavor and thicker noodles."

I don't have any problems eating whole wheat pasta and neither does my son, but we couldn't eat this.  I am a firm believer that food can be both healthy and delicious at the same time.  This may be healthy but it is not tasty which means to me that it is not worth eating.  Try the Hodgson Mills whole wheat macaroni and cheese instead.  It is so much better."

No, I'm not stretching the truth; I still have it, and I'm considering sending it back. It smells like cut grass, and tastes like cut grass. Maybe I have a defect? Either way, the taste is absolutely putrid for a tea, and I think someone just mowed some grass, and put the clippings in a container.<br /><br />Again, I tried to like it after all of the hype. I steeped at the proper temperature for the proper amount of time, and even tried multiple attempts. Nope, tastes/looks/smells like grass clippings.

It was getting so bad, that I figured I'd spend the money and try one of these sprays knowing that the reviews for pretty much all of them seem to be split.  I figured I had nothing to lose.  So I applied as per the labels instructions.  I did not have any issue with the spray damaging any of my flowers or plants and it did seem to work initially.  I had almost a week with no new damage. There was also no rain of any note that may have washed it away.  I don't think the rain since has washed it away either though, as I can see a residue on some of the leaves on some plants that were sprayed and left high up in a place where rabbits couldn't get to them.  Unfortunately, the happiness was short-lived. Again I was coming home to check on my plants and finding more bitten off leaves and decapitated lilies. I stopped checking before leaving for work because it would put me in such a bad mood every time I'd see more ""victims"".<br /> I just hate spending almost $20.00 for something (I was so desperate that I paid the extra 3.99 for 1 day even though I am a prime member) that in the end did not work as it should have. I just planted replacement bulbs for the 22 of 25 lilies that were beheaded and now I am here looking for a different kind of rabbit/small animal repellent. It's difficult to choose, as again it seems many products work for some and not for others.

That's why I was excited to try the Puroast Low-Acid Coffee-French Roast. Finally, maybe I would find a less-acid-y coffee that tasted like coffee without the side effects. Unfortunately, this one wasnt it. When I set it to brew, I was waiting for that pungent aroma of coffee to waft through the kitchen. I waited. I waited. Finally, a small hint of coffee aroma. OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste-test, one would be hard-pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant. I thought it might 'grow' on me-and even forced myself to drink a second cup. It didn't grow on me, sorry to say, although I didn't feel any acid after-effects like I often do with regular coffee. Puroast upheld the low-acid portion of the bargain admirably . . I just wish they'd have upheld the coffee part as well. I wont be buying this as a coffee substitute; I'll either deal with the acid-and have both the taste and smell of coffee-or do without."

She didn't have heartburn, but she also didn't drink very much either - due to taste.  She thought it tasted a little stale and bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but seems the process to limit the acid also limits the flavor.  Too bad, I had hoped this was going to be a big winner."

I prepared the Puroast in a Technivorm Moccamaster, though I did back down to a bit less than the full three ounces against 10 cups of filtered water.<br /><br />The result was disappointing.  The brew was strong enough, and certainly presented a low-acidity.  That said, the flavor is fairly flat, with almost a chemical or plastic undertone.  There is no complexity to the brew, where even a run-of-the-mill Folgers offers some flavor signature.<br /><br />For someone who cannot tolerate the acid in a typical cup, it is coffee.

The answer is, at best, nothing special.<br /><br />While billed as a ""dark French roast"", the fine grind of the coffee was more suggestive of espresso, and for best results one should not make espresso in a standard automatic drip coffee pot. The coffee had an acrid aroma and initial taste, which quickly gave way to an empty and hollow flavor, such as one might get when drinking the melted ice from what was once an iced coffee or making instant coffee with cold water.

I've never tried a low acid coffee. I just modify my diet to manage my heartburn and take the occasional antacid.  I made this coffee in the morning before work so I was sort of rushed and forgot to stop and smell it before I put it in the coffee maker.  But really, a good coffee with fill your nose with that delicious coffee aroma and one shouldn't have to make an effort to remember to smell it.  I'm glad I didn't though because as it was brewing my kitchen was filled with a combination of woodiness, smoke, and campfire....from coffee!<br /><br />Now I love my morning coffee so even the less than appetizing smell was not going to deter me (that and I had to get to work)!  As I usually do I poured a cup for myself and poured the rest into my huge thermos.  Drinking the coffee was slightly less unpleasent than the smell suggested it would be.  While sipping I was reminded of drinking a too heavily oaked Cabernet.  Yes, I enjoy red wine too, perhaps that's why I get heartburn? As this coffee cooled in my cup it actually tasted better...not good but better then the first couple of sips.  The manufactures claim this coffee is not bitter..I disagree.  In addition to wood, smoke, and campfire, bitter was the extra added layer of flavor.<br /><br />I tried this coffee black first, then with cream, and then later in the day I took the rest and mixed half coffee with half skim milk on ice.  The overwhelming woodiness was present each time.  I'm giving this coffee two stars instead of one because I did have three cups instead of throwing it out after the first sip...hey sometimes caffeine is caffeine...but I would never buy this.  I usually buy my coffee from Dean's Beans online but I also enjoy the lower end coffees like Yuban and Kirkland (Costco brand).  So I'm definitely not a coffee snob.  Good coffee is good coffee.

Pretty much anyone else can easily skip it, however, as the taste and smell are both frankly supbar.<br /><br />Clearly other reviewers have enjoyed this coffee, so individual taste reactions may vary, but I'm baffled at why this is advertised as being less bitter than standard coffee. It has a very strong and unpleasant chemical taste that is significantly more bitter than nearly any other coffee I've had in recent memory.<br /><br />This may not be an issue for everyone, but it's worth noting that the Puroast low acid variety doesn't create that wonderful brewed coffee aroma at all. You have to put your nose directly next to the cup to smell it at all, and then the result is an off-putting chemical scent to match the flavor. Having my kitchen fill up with that distinctive scent to let everyone know the coffee is ready is a major part of the coffee drinking experience, and this brand doesn't offer that.<br /><br />It seems like Puroast may be an acquired taste, but after four cups and trying the coffee both black and with different creamer options, I certainly didn't acquire it and can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious heartburn problem."

But because I truly love a coffee indulgence, I had sincerely hoped this low acid coffee would be the answer to my problems.<br /><br />Sadly though, I have to say, this coffee is BITTER!  - I for one, am a fan of a smooth roast.  Now if you're a Starbucks fan, you may disagree with me.  I, in particular, am not at all fond of Starbucks and their coffee, and the best I can say to describe this coffee, would be to compare it to Starbucks' most bitter blend... and then some.<br /><br />If you were to ask only my taste-buds, they'd say ""no thank-you""  ...but as far as acidity is concerned, this coffee is spot-on."

But I'm not a fan of the Puroast Low Acid Coffee, French Roast.  It leaves a funny taste in my mouth that I can't quite identify, and I tried this coffee black, with sugar, with sugar and skim milk.  That unidentifiable funny taste was still there.  As I've never tried a ""low-acid"" coffee before trying this product, I don't know whether to pin it on Puroast as a brand, as something they do with their beans, or if the strange taste is a trade-off in low-acid coffee.  In the days since trying this coffee, I've had other brands/kinds of coffee and have not had that weird taste, so I don't think it's me.

It's not like it is too strong to drink - in fact it's very light. But the taste is weird.<br /><br />Having said that, taste is a personal choice so some people may love it.

I wanted it to be good, but after the first few sips I got bitter after taste. The idea of it is good, French Roast is usually sweet and tasty. This has this bitter undertone, not sure if that has something to do with the removeal of acidic properties. Also it's pretty expensive for it not to taste like a fine brewed coffee. Overall I don't think I could pay for this, even though I like the idea of a less acidic Coffee. Maybe if they could lose the bitter taste, but after two pots of it that taste is prominent. So a no go for me."

French roast is typically my favorite type of roast. The aroma is nice after brewing, but smelling this coffee right out of the pack it smells plastic-like. Also, I found that this coffee had a quite strong bitter taste.<br /><br />Though, I did notice that this coffee did seem to be easier on my stomach. I'm sure this might work well for someone who loves coffee, but, has a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />Overall, a basic French roast nothing too spectacular. Might be good for someone who wants a low acid coffee who is willing to sacrifice the typical French roast depth of flavor. Though in my opinion this coffee is way overpriced as the flavor is lacking and it still manages to be bitter."

Not the case with Puroast.<br /><br />First, the smell upon opening the bag of Puroast dark French roast was underwhelming to say the least.  It was nothing that I could attach an adjective like ""rich"" or ""inviting"" to but rather made me think ""what an odd aroma for coffee.""  Not a good start.<br /><br />The quantity in the bag seemed small in the filter so I brewed with 10 cups of water and not 12.  I think it was a good choice because I could still see too much light through the brewed coffee for my taste.  And speaking of taste, I found this coffee to have an ash like character.  Not rich, smoky or full bodied like I anticipate a French roast to be.  The aftertaste is unpleasant and really lingers.  Overall, not a good coffee experience.<br /><br />Because taste is subjective, I will mention what coffee I find tasty so you can get an idea of what the other end of the spectrum from Puroast is for me.  Peet's Major Dickason's and Ola's Organic Uganda Bugisu are two of my favorites."

I had to give up regular coffee about 10 years ago, much to my dismay.  The only type of coffee that I've been able to drink is Folger's ""Simply Smooth"" and it can be difficult to find in my area.  So, I was pleased to see another low acid brew on the market.  I brewed a pot, drank one cup and promptly poured the rest of it down the drain.  I gave this product 2 stars because it did not aggravate my stomach in any way, so it did live up to its claim, but, the taste of the coffee was awful.  Since taste is subjective, I hesistate to dissuade others from trying the Puroast, but I have to caution buyers about the taste.  In my former coffee drinking days, I was never picky about brands, and I find the taste of the Folgers low acid coffee to be almost as good as their regular brand, so again, I would caution coffee lovers that Puroast, while it's definitely easy on the tummy, is not as pleasing on the palate."

The coffee advertises as low acid, but after two cups, I was feeling the acid. I'm sure it is most likely because of the dark roast rather than any extra acid in the coffee. The flavor is good when fresh brewed, but it doesn't sit in the pot well. It would be best for company when the whole pot will be served rather than as a daily pot for one person. It is very strong, and reminds me of New Orleans coffee without chicory."

So I tried the Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast one morning (on a morning without any tummy issues so I wouldn't skew the result) and sat down for what I hoped would be a new coffee find.  It wasn't.<br /><br />Unlike most dark roasts that have a rich aroma and flavor, this had a flat bitter taste that was more like coffee that had been left in the pot too long.  It wasn't horrible ... I've actually had much worse ... but it wasn't very good and combined with the price point should give even those with terrible acid reflux second thoughts.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this product but, while not terrible, it is just a very mediocre cup of coffee.  Given the choice, I'll just deal with the acid until something more palatable comes along."

I normally brew dunkin donuts brand coffees at home and really enjoy their flavor.  There are a few other brands that I will buy when they are available in this town, though that is rarely.<br /><br />I did not care for the flavor of this coffee.  It was very wooden tasting and almost had an old burnt coffee flavor to it.

So, I was excited about the product.  Sure enough, true to advertising, it is not bitter.  So far, so good.  And, I'm going to take their word for it that the coffee is low in acid.  However, for a low-acid coffee, it has a strangely acidic-tasting quality about it.  Can't quite get a handle on it, some kind of funny after-taste that is not pleasant - maybe it's actually an alkaline aftertaste that I'm not used to in a coffee.  At any rate, this has an ""off"" taste to it, like some type of chemical residue has been left in the coffee.<br /><br />One star for taste, 4 stars for being non-bitter and (presumably) low in acid.  Strange product."
23097,B004ZIER34,A141INO5311NA,7/31/11,0,0,2,"Very strong coffee, burnt-tasting.","I'm not sure most American coffee drinkers would go for this. I tried it several times at varying strengths, and even using half what I normally use, it tasted way too strong and burnt. It has very little complexity--whatever is there is drowned in the harsh burnt taste that reminds me of mud for some reason. I don't have an issue with regular coffee though I did once have trouble with acid reflux; I didn't notice much difference in acidity levels and the sheer overwhelming strength of the coffee gave me a stomachache that normal coffee doesn't.<br /><br />I understand that some foreign drinkers might like this and suspect that's the market the manufacturer is going for. I gave two stars because some people might actually really like that strong taste in their coffee. I don't think it's bad coffee, just really really strong. It makes me wonder what their normal roasts and blends might taste like."
23100,B004ZIER34,A19GSC3QMK694Q,7/31/11,0,0,2,"too strong & tasted yukky to me, smelled bad too.","I don't know if its because I used too much of it, or its the coffee, or its just my taste, but this was way to strong for me. As far as the acid free part, that seemed to be true. It didn't flip out my stomach with too much acid like some coffee's do. I just didn't like the flavor of it. When I first opened the bag of coffee I didn't like the smell of it either. It just didn't have that nice coffee smell. Not sure what it smelled like, but it wasn't coffee and it was a really dark black fine grind that didn't look much like coffee either. I assumed that the package was supposed to be for a single pot of coffee and used the whole thing in my Bun Coffee brewer. It could have been too strong because my Bun Coffee brewer has a smaller pot than my old Mr Coffee does. But it doesn't seem to make that much difference with my usual Folgers coffee. While it was brewing it didn't smell much like coffee either. I tried a couple cups and it was so strong that after I dumped the grounds out of the basket I ran a couple cups of water through it to dilute the pot of coffee a little bit. Didn't help any, it still tasted way too strong for me. If I had some more of it I might try using half the prepackaged amount but I don't think it would change the taste of it all that much. Would I buy some of this coffee anyway because its acid free? No. Wouldn't matter how cheap it was either. Would I recommend this coffee to somebody? Not if they were one of my friends! Who would like this coffee? Maybe somebody that's used to having the very strong espresso coffee or the super strong coffee I've heard they drink in the middle east. But I don't think anybody that I know would like this particular coffee."
23103,B004ZIER34,A2UQIQUOAB47OT,8/24/11,2,2,2,It does have the low acid going for it...,...but that is about all.  It appears a lot of taste was sacrificed to achieve the low acid.  I think the reason it is French Roast was to try and add some flavor.  I would rather do without coffee than to drink this.  Not recommended.
23105,B004ZIER34,A3GYY4CBRUZRSO,8/21/11,2,2,2,Ehh..,"It may be low acid, but the trade-off isn't worth it. The odor & the flavor are both poor, and the coffee is relatively weak, which I guess I shouldn't complain about - if I'm going to drink a cup of foul-tasting liquid, I'd prefer it to be as weak as possible!"
23113,B004ZIER34,A1YZEKPPMXG1YJ,7/30/11,0,0,2,Too strong,"I brewed a pot of this but found it too strong. Stronger than Starbucks even. Even with extra milk it still had that too strong taste. No acidic aftertaste, but I don't think many will enjoy its taste."
23114,B004ZIER34,A100ZQDV7L8PVV,7/30/11,0,0,2,pH near neutral but so is the flavor,"I have tried this coffee hot and iced,with milk and black and I tested the pH.  Frankly it won't qualify as a great cup of coffee.  The flavor is burnt (like Starbucks dark roast) but is flat and it lacks middle notes and vanillins (unlike Starbucks.)  Perhaps flavors other than French Roast would be better at providing complexity as that frequently comes from Colombian roast in a blend. The aroma is underwhelming.<br /><br />The pH of the Puroast coffee tested at 6.5, slightly acidic (neutral is 7 on a scale of 0-14.0) but less so than normal coffee.  Normal coffee ranges from around 5.0 - 5.1, more neutral than beer or any fruit juice and similar to carbonated water. If you can drink those, then your stomach isn't reacting to the acidity but something else. So normal coffee, whether it irritates you or not, isn't all that acidic.  Acidity generally refers to a flavor note in coffee rather than pH and coffee without acid flavor notes tastes flat.  Irritation may instead come from the essential oils in the beans or the caffeine.<br /><br />(Having too much stomach acid has exactly the same symptoms as too little stomach acid and most people over 35 are slightly deficient in hydrochloric acid and 50% of people over 50 are seriously hypochlorhydric, but we are taught to regard the symptoms as being from acidity. Your Tums work by other mechanisms, beyond the scope of this review.)<br /><br />So while Puroast is attempting to solve an acid/base problem that doesn't significantly exist, the fact that the flavor is low probably means that the essential oils in the beans are lowered as well, making the coffee less irritating.  Frankly I'd rather add about 20% chicory to good coffee, which slightly sweetens the taste and is less irritating.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001M11HI"">Frontier Natural - Chicory - Roasted, 1 lbs</a>Is it worth giving up flavor to drink coffee?

The smell was not that of a good strong smelling, fair trade bean that I am use to.  It is hard to describe but the smell was slightly better than my tennis shoe.  Despite the smell, I still gave it a fair chance.  As I sipped on the first cup, I kept saying to myself, ""this will get better.""  I thought I just needed to get use to it.  While I was able to finish two cups, I cannot say that I enjoyed them.  I cannot describe the taste other than to say that it was an original coffee taste.  It's something I have never tasted before in a coffee.  And the aftertaste was super long lasting.  In fact I brushed my teeth twice and was still tasting the coffee an hour later.  As far as being easy on my stomach, it was no different than other coffee.  I still had to use the toilet after I finished my second cup.  I would not pay money for this product."

Would I be able to form an opinion with such a small amount?  Yes, Yes, Yes, definitely yes.<br /><br />Upon opening the envelope I was overwhelmed by the aroma and checked the envelope again to make sure I hadn't opened a package of loose tobacco. The brewed coffee didn't smell any better as the kitchen was filled with a smell like a dirty ashtray. The taste is not better. I dutifully drank three cups so I could give it a fair assessment, and the last cup tasted as bad as the first. I even added a spoonfull of chocolate powder to the last cup to make it palatable. That only helped marginally.<br /><br />I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It may be low acid and make one's tummy feel better, but it's a big price to pay for the comfort. Now I'm disappointed that I still have a little of this stuff left. Definitely don't recommend this flavor.<br /><br />Why didn't I give this foul tasting brew one star? I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because evaluating taste is a subjective thing, and after all there is that low acid factor to consider."

I'm afraid that the Puroast fits into a similar category. I do prefer low-acid coffee, but I was hoping for less bitterness as well. No amount of milk or sweetener was able to render it palatable for my tender taste buds. I would suggest that, if you like strong, bitter coffee, it may be worth a try - but y'all can have my share."

It smelled bitter and almost sour and sure enough that's exactly how it tasted as well. I am used to strong coffee but this is was just a travesty. In order to not waste it, I added some cappuccino and milk to it and managed to get it down but even through that, the sourness was still evident to some extent."
23205,B004ZIER34,A3SZXYX9YEDGT6,8/31/11,2,3,2,Seriously Foul Coffee,"I'm not picky about coffee. I'll drink just about any dreck that's been sitting in a pot, mug or carafe for a day or two. Just heat it up and serve me. Normally, I use a one-cup instant bag with boiling water and I get a fairly decent cup of coffee from Folgers using theirs or any store knock-off.<br /><br />Those taste like gourmet compared, and are certainly much better than the ""coffee"" I made this morning from Puroast's French Roast 3-ounce bag.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have stated it tastes like gas, ashes, fuel and I agree. Add to those descriptions a hint of motor oil, old basement and a sprinkle of dog dander.<br /><br />I opened the container and was greeted with an ashy, somewhat mildew-like odor. Oh well, keep going, I say. I boiled water and let a bag steep in the pot for a while as I don't like drip. I feel you get a much better full flavor from steeping. It took a while for the dark color to appear, but soon it looked very coffee-like and I put some in a mug. I smelled it first, noticing that it lacked a standard coffee scent. Then I tasted it with exactly the result I was expecting, a decidedly un-coffee flavor. Stale, with a hint of dried leaves? That's the best I can come up with. So, I added sweetener (stevia) and my usual cream (vanilla soy milk). It still tasted nothing like real coffee to me.<br /><br />I didn't give the mug a chance to comfort my stomach, poured it out and made a regular cup of joe that I could drink. Seriously, this is simply not a good product in my estimation. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I guess in a dire emergency this drink could possibly give you enough caffeine to limp, crawl or otherwise slither out to a store to buy actual coffee or at least be served something warm by the Red Cross."

We opened each box, finding all cookies in the same condition -- messed up chocolate sticking to the package, cookies overtly sticky.  If I can find these in a b&m store, I'll update, but won't order online again.

My oven was at the right temperature, and I baked for just over 12 minutes (around 157 degrees according to my tests).  And I tried it with some center-cut pork chops with the bone in, which should have made the resulting dish better than if I'd chosen plain old no-bone pork chops, but 100% of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all.<br /><br />One person said that the one part of her chop that I missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took.  Another tester said she wished I had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether.<br /><br />I myself appreciated the crunch of this coating, but every bite had an off flavor that I would prefer had not been there.  I too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops.<br /><br />In case you're interested, here's the ingredients list.  ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SALT, CANOLA OIL, SUGAR, SPICE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, DRIED ONIONS, DEXTROSE, YEAST, EXTRACTIVES OF PAPRIKA, ASCORBIC ACID.  I think you can whip up a reasonable substitute -- except for the caramel color -- by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika, and I'd add some pepper if I were you unless you don't want me to.<br /><br />Why shake?<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip-top bag and shake them, especially since you must supply the bag, and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product.  Why can't you just dump the 2.25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge?  I get the bake part of Shake 'N Bake, but I don't get the shake part.<br /><br />The package says to buy four to six half-inch-thick pork chops, and I bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of -- just a moment while I whip out my spreadsheet here -- four.  As you can see from the photograph I've thoughtfully added, they were pretty big chops, and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one, not to mention a fifth and sixth.<br /><br />This morning for breakfast I fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating, and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night.<br /><br />As a result, I conclude that this product needs improvement, and I rate it two stars.  I'd rate it one star, but that means that I literally hate it, which is a bit strong.  I just have no immediate or even long-term plans to use it again.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, as I can attest from having run the experiments for you, this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca, a mocha latte, or vanilla ice cream (or probably any other flavor, but vanilla was all we had).<br /><br />-- Update: I don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page, so I take back what I said above about ""the photograph I've thoughtfully added.""

There was not much flavor nor texture added to the pork chops.<br /><br />It was certainly easy, but it doesn't take much to fix up your own breading so saving an extra couple of minutes is not worth the lack of flavor in my opinion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product and will likely stay away from other Shake 'N Bake products."

I didn't expect it to be as good as 'from scratch', but I expected it to be edible.<br /><br />If you were alive in the 70's, you know that Shake n Bake is a pre-made coating you put in a bag along with your meat.  As you may have guessed, you shake the bag, then bake your meat.  It's simple, and it's a low fat alternative to stovetop methods that need oil or butter. But the result is pretty pedestrian.  The coating doesn't crisp very well; it was downright mushy in spots, and the 'spices' in the mix were bland bland bland.<br /><br />Pork is already low fat and bland.  It needs a little bit of fat for flavor.  I don't fry any meat, but I do sautee my pork chops (coated with Panko & my own spices)in a splash of olive oil , which makes them moister, tastier, and crunchier.  To me, the baking just didn't work well.  Maybe if the SnB coating was actually, you know, flavorful, it would have helped.

Hearing that they have good coffee, I went and found my latte to be marvelous, better than anything at Starbucks or Caribou coffee.  Since then, I gone in on numerous occasions and had their full range of drinks, including their drip coffee.  Thinking that I could save some money, I bought this coffee to make myself a fresh cup in the morning.  I was careful to get the right grind size for my french press.  My homemade coffee does not compare with the illy's made coffee.  I dunno if they use fresher beans or what, but I found this coffee from Amazon to be dull, flavorless and definitely not worth the $26 price.  I only used 1/2 of the canister before switching over to Peets.  If you're in the mood for illy's, you should just go to their cafe to get a cup, otherwise brew something else at home."

I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, ""potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)"".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best."

If you have ever eaten ""Funyuns"" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try ""Grandma Utz"" potato chips, a true potato chip."

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."

When I tried the original popchips, I was surprised by how good the taste and texture was, so I bought this in bulk, thinking it would be excellent because of the company and because I love sweet potatoes of course.<br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For some reason, the sweet potato chip they've created tastes like cardboard despite having the same texture (cross between rice cake and chip), added with a dash of salt. That's it. I can't describe it any other way than a ""bland blah taste with salt""<br /><br />I wish I had gotten the parmesean garlic or the original instead."

So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."

I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice."

This product reminded me of them, not the same but similar. My son wanted me to try them and then invest in the company. I am glad so many people like them but I will pass on eating them and it looks like it is a private company.... So no stock either."

There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag."

The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the ""modified"" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said ""I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again."" My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain."

With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips."
24196,B0013NUGDE,A1YGDKJ7CAOQN3,9/16/10,0,4,2,why did the price go up for these popchips,that is so unfair. I was a faithful customer now i have to go buy them somewhere else . Why Amazon!!!
24197,B0013NUGDE,AQNLG42HPS5KD,4/18/09,1,6,2,Packaging is misleading,"I bought a big bag of these and I don't mind the strong pepper taste. What I do mind is the bag implies these are Potato chips.<br /><br />There is absolutely no potato taste left in this snack; if you like eating extremely salty onion powder this snack is for you.<br /><br />Going by the bag I expected: REAL potatos, a little oil and baking, finally sprinkled with salt and pepper only? Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.<br /><br />If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!<br /><br />--VS"
24199,B0013NUGDE,A1B2UXUU1H9CPT,7/15/10,0,5,2,Not so good,"After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree. About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos, but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet, these will probably due."
24225,B0013NUGDE,A28WXDXJA1P0MC,1/24/12,1,1,2,"These definitely taste like ""diet"" chips","After reading several reviews from people apparently on diets I now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good. These are bland, have a weird texture and aren't very good. I will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away. I ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry. They are low in calories and low in taste. Pass."

It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!"
24277,B001E0T29K,A3SP3F4YQYDPZ2,9/13/10,0,1,2,Not the best,"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."

But the product is so inconsistent, even within the same bag.  Many of the apple pieces are chewy and some have no cinnamon flavour while other pieces are overpowered by it.  I don't appreciate the toughness of those of the pieces because since theyre already dry by nature, they have a tendency of sticking to one's teeth.  Some even taste stale.  Furthermore, there seems to be a lot of scraps of peel (in this way it reminds me of pig slop).  I don't know if it's the season or what, but these apples are very sour.  I begin to notice after eating 1/3 of a bag.  I bought this because it promised ""crunch.""  At best, this is a lackluster characteristic of the Bare Fruit CInnamon Apples."

While I like the crunch factor, it can be hard to keep the chicken from getting soggy on the bottom. It's really a glorified breading which is about as easy to make as boiling water.

24459,B004R8J8EK,A2QCE7L6GRE3MT,8/7/11,0,1,2,Don't understand this product,"If I were going to make breaded chicken my first thought would be to use generic breadcrumbs.  Shake N Bake does have a few pros - it's finely ground so it sticks to every surface of the chicken, and it does leave the chicken moist.  However, it's more expensive than generic breadcrumbs and is less flavorful.  The whole shake and bake concept could also be used with breadcrumbs... I am a little baffled as to why anyone would spend the extra money for Shake N Bake."

This appeared to fit the bill, so I bought a six-pack!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy cooking - Very easy to cook, finished in under four minutes, and requires no additional materials (except about a cup of water).<br />2) healthy - is fairly healthy (all things considered).<br />3) Contains meat - this is a debatable pro, however I've found it difficult to actually find microwave meals (that require no refrigerator/freezer) that contain meat. This does, although not very much...<br />4) Acceptable serving size - given that the base of the dish is rice, the serving size is acceptable for a light lunch. I certainly feel full for most of the afternoon if I eat this meal with an extra snack during my lunch hour.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) low-average flavor/taste - I've definitely had better microwave meals (even microwave easy mac beats this). I usually love sweet and sour, but this flavor profile tastes more like an artificial pineapple flavor fused with minute-rice. I will not be re-purchasing this item solely based on it's poor execution of flavor.<br />2) Uneven rice texture - The base of this dish is quick-cook rice, and the method that Healthy Choice chose was basically rehydration of cooked rice in a microwave. The result is unevenly cooked rice with either too firm or too soft texture.<br />3) Very sparse serving of veggies/meat - despite the fact that this meal contains veggies/meat, the size of the serving is very sparse. Whether it was to cut production cost or to cut caloric cost, the result is a very meager portion of flavored rice with bits of processed chicken/veggies.<br /><br />All-in-all, this meal has some pros that I was really looking for in no-fridge/to-go meals, but the cons just outweigh them too much. I won't be purchasing again."

Although the convenience and nutrition and pluses, the flavor just leaves a lot to be desired.  To be honest this one would be better if you ate it blindfolded, as the chicken chunks and sauce really make it look like you are eating cat food.  Ignoring the visual appear, or lack thereof, the flavor still doesn't compare to the Zesty Marinara Penne, Rotini Meat Sauce and Southwestern Chicken.  I will not be reordering."

Black tea should be black, not red.  This tea was also quite cheap at Whole Foods, only $3.99 for organic tea.

I come back to Amazon to buy more and notice something I missed the first time: someone has written a review saying they're made in China.

Alas, the hype didn't live up to the reality.  The product is essentially a wasted purchase, as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff.  I'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry.<br /><br />The ingredient list drew me to the product, being grain-free, and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood, plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler.  Upon opening the can, it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high, with little seafood scent detectable.  It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.  Have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff, and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them.<br /><br />I realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything, but when none of my nine will touch the stuff, I can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi-finicky cat, as a number of my gang will eat most anything, and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye-popping.  If you're cat is very picky, but you know s/he likes beef, then this flavor will probably appeal to him/her, but otherwise, I wouldn't spend your hard-earned moolah on this stuff.  Save your money and your frustration.<br /><br />I give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list; I'd otherwise give it only one star."

If you like coffee with body/""legs"", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz ""cup"" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder.

We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to ""spin"" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't ""Paw-centric"" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw.

I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead."
25117,B0081XIA1E,A11IDK9L74LPT1,5/4/12,10,11,2,Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.,"I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning ""nosework"" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective ""nosing the flap"" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10"" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4"" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4"" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2""x2"" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1"".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could ""find"" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2"" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she ""finds"" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-"
25119,B0081XIA1E,A1G6H7SAKTYZZJ,4/29/11,5,5,2,Good idea however....,"This toy is not that great for my pug. He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it."

It takes me longer to hide the treat in it than it takes for him to solve the puzzle. Pieces made of thin plastic. My dog had more fun chewing on the pieces than looking for the treats.

He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles."

Actually, I'm sorry I bought it. However, I bought two of the squirrels in the tree trunk toys, one for me and one for a friend, and we're very happy with them."

I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the ""spin"" and ""flip"" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a ""cheater"", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a ""project in the works"", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!"

It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.

My Mensa-smart Cattledogs figured out the game immediately, opening the flaps just fine.  But after a couple good retrievals the older dog looked at me as if to say, ""Are you kidding me?"", inserted a toenail into the top hole of this thing, and flipped it over to get the treat.  I'm going to try gluing it to a board so he can't cheat.  But overall, I'd say this is for very small dogs or slow ones."

An average can of soda contains 45 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened mango puree, but I can't find it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake.

It is too much of a hassle to return all 6 cans because of one damaged can.  And I need one can for mango cupcakes that I'm making this weekend.

I have tried other, non-organic decafs before and was dissatisfied. I thought maybe an organic version would suit my taste buds. Considering that I always find decaf coffees less than enjoyable, please do not take my review as ""gospel"". I would recommend that anyone who is trying to reduce their caffeine intake should try this product and make up your own mind. I only drink 1 1/2 cups of coffee in the morning. So, I'm not abusing caffeine. However, I think I just enjoy the flavor of ""real"" coffee too  much to enjoy the taste of straight decaf. Currently, I'm doing a scoop of regular organic coffee and a scoop of HealthWise. At least I'm getting closer to my ""caffeine free"" goal. :-)"

I think the last time I made it I cooked the noodles for 5 1/2 minutes (the box recommends 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 minutes) and they still fell apart.

So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans).

25426,B001TGX88U,A2A8E70X0VXJT0,5/3/10,5,7,2,"mediocre taste, hilariously misleading packaging","I admit I bought a box of these at an Organic Sensitive Aware Health food grocery store, so I expected it to be expensive. However, this one deserves to be an entry in Consumer Reports' last page, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of at the moment.  Each month, the last page of CR's magazine has pictures people send in of scandalously absurd ripoffs, ad goofs, typos, etc, such as a picture of a six-inch tall pill bottle with the 1/2 cubic inch of actual pills that came in it --i.e. making the packaging look real big so the sucker customer will not realize the contents are so paltry.  Enjoy Life's marketing department did its job well; the box is 5 1/4""H x 6 1/2""W x 1 1/2"" D: the actual food item, once you unwrap the (5 1/2"" inch long) foil packet is just under 3"" long, less than 1/2"" wide, & 3/8"" deep.  I was driving when I ripped open the packet, & almost drove off the road when I beheld the veritable rat-poo dimensions of the bar.  Yes, it is sold by weight (5 oz; the things are dense), but the packaging is ridiculously misleading.<br /><br />Oh, the taste.  It's okay; vaguely sunflower seed-ish, merely the barest rumor of a whisper of sweetness or salt; as with most GF food manufacturers, Enjoy Life seems to feel that those of us who must forego gluten, or dairy or nuts or whatever also have no interest in flavor.  It does have a nice chewy mouth feel to it, which would have been nicer had there been more to feel.<br /><br />In a (presumably) unconscious self-satire, in big letters on the back of the box, it says ""Still Hungry?""  Well yes, and I know several people who would answer same if they ate the entire box of bar-lets, particularly if they'd been expecting something appropriate to the size of the box."

BTW, you can't see inside the package, or any other Enjoy Life package for that matter. Then, the Perky's Rice Crunch I purchased and enjoyed for months changed, the label had the Enjoy Life logo on it--and 2 ounces less product at a higher price! Okay, the times they are a'changin' and I moved on. Last week I purchased the ""Chewy on the go Bars, Sunbutter Crunch."" The taste was good; what more do I deserve! However, it was a marketing triumph: four dollars and forty nine cents for 5 diminutive bars, at least compared to the packaging. The bars are about two thirds the size of the foil wrap they come in! Add in the dead space in the box and you got what used to be referred to as ""a rip off."" In a health food store no one can hear you scream."

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.

Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed.

First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close.

I won't be getting these again."

Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer)."

I did like the fact that it has a meaty texture, but not a hard leather texture that I tend to avoid in jerky. It was hard enough so that I had to floss my teeth to avoid irritation to my gums, but that's true with all meat. Besides texture, it also tasted like meat. However, it also tasted like someone was trying to make a BBQ flavored candy bar. Way too sweet, and just an overall bad taste. My dog goes nuts for them though, so they're not completely wasted."

Instead it is the regular version of GMC's Hazelnut. The regular version is weak - I knew it was from past experience, so I would not have bought this product if I had realized it contained their regular hazelnut coffee. Amazon has a terrible time with keeping up with accurate information on their website at least as it pertains to k-cups. (I called in w/a question about product count for packaging on another occasion due to the price point for the qty shown - their C/S people couldn't confirm one way or another. The result - I didn't buy the product from Amazon) You have to change out descriptions and product information and keep it up to date - but instead, I see they put a disclaimer that they are not responsible.

These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.

They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again.

I now believe what the breeder had given me was something else that looks just like these puppy chews.  Maybe it was an edible dog chew.

Next, I tried it in some tea and my dislike was confirmed.  The taste is tepid and to me it does not come close to sweetening using a 1:1 ratio to regular or turbinado sugar.

Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal, though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this brand."

Whole Earth Farms is supposed to be an affordable way for responsible pet owners to feed their pets Merrick quality, but it seems Merrick has decided to up the ante based on this food's popularity.  I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous brand.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi-gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it."

Although it does not cause the gas ""problem"" that can occur with large comsumption of Honey Tree, I believe I will stay with Honey Tree. Note: I have used Honey Tree as a base for pecan pie (instead of Karo syrup) and it was just okay. Excess gas was a definite problem as I always eat a large slice of pecan pie. I intend to make a pie with the Natrazyle. If it is better than the Honey Tree I will report back."

27585,B000FK52B2,A2UL567RGQCF38,7/16/12,5,6,2,"Not what it was cracked up to be, for me","I've used the European style drip sprouters by Bioset, now called the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N03EK0"">Victorio VKP1013 Round Three-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, for over ten years, with good results. There was room for improvement, but overall I was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure, and now I also grow micro-greens and baby greens in trays. When I decided to take the Bioset on an extended trip and it cracked (silly me), I thought I'd ""upgrade"" to this one, on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there, which maligned the Bioset-style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them. The Sprout Master was billed as the best sprouter in the world, a breeze to use, handy, yadda yadda yadda. The best thing since sliced (sprouted-grain) bread.<br /><br />This was not my experience. I guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style, with the exception of increased inconvenience. The Sprout Master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour-and-drip system. This did not bother me in and of itself, however, as I enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them. I was happy to put in more work for better results. Also, with this sprouter, you have to soak your seeds first, which the European style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds. When they are unsprouted, a bit of the water sits in the trays, allowing a mini-soak. Once they sprout, more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle. If you are really concerned about too much water sitting there (one of the complaints from the sprouting site), you just give it a few quick shakes, and off goes the water. Here, again, I was unperturbed: I like the process of nurturing my sprouts. Nevertheless, I began to wonder whether the results would be much improved.<br /><br />They weren't. It seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions. First, the holes for dripping, which I really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing, are too large to hold alfalfa, mustard, and similar small seeds, even after soaking overnight. You lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two. Then, unless you mist the seeds, rinsing tumbles them all around, in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase. This means that you don't get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber-careful. Were that not enough, my first batch just got rotten, moldy, and nasty--something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters. So I resolved to try again, thinking that maybe I didn't pay attention to placing the lids on properly (necessary in order to allow for air circulation). But first I had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter (the build quality is not encouraging), and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow, which I'd also never had to do with the drip sprouters. The second time around I got somewhat better results, but they still did not begin to compare to my standard Bioset crop, even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds. Far fewer seeds sprouted (and I'm using the same mix as ever), and they were a knotted mess. I could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth.<br /><br />Perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically. It may be, too, that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me, but I did not see the point. I knew I could do better, and the 30-day deadline for returns was glowering. So I sent it back, and am now trying Victorio's updated drip sprouter, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVPP04"">Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, which, though still not ideal, I much prefer to the Sprout Master. The new model is BPA free, made of crack-resistant plastic, does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version (an admitted nuisance), and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge. At half the price of the Sprout Master. So far, my first set of sprouts (again, using the same mix) did just dandy, without loss of seeds, mold, rot, tumbled sprouts, marauding roots or seed-clogged holes. Plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there. (The Sprout Master is opaque, so you can't see the sprouts once they've grown--nor would you necessarily want to, unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically.)<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted to like this sprouter, and feel like a ""real"" kitchen gardener. But I just didn't. In the end, what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest, not a name brand."

It looks like regular chili, has some fat like regular chili, has a texture like regular chili, and it almost tastes good, if you can get past the salt.<br /><br />This is the second, and last, of this brand and type of veggie product I will try. They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat. A much better, IMHO, veggie chili can be made with some diced onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, a hot chile of your choice, garlic, oregano, chili powder, a little masa, tomato paste, and one or more types of beans, like pintos, kidneys, mayo coba, etc. Just a pinch of salt and your done, or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.<br /><br />I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.<br /><br />Edit: I'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me, so we don't eat too many of them. I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried, vegetarian or not, this compared favorably. But, I can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt. This was the deal breaker for me, as it is with other prepared, canned chilis."

If you are looking for the subtle taste and firmer texture of the original Delfa Roll you had when you were a kid, forget it.  This will disappoint you.  Obviously, there was some demand for the company to attempt to bring it back, but if they went to the effort to do so, how come they did't obtain the recipe patent?!?!"

First off the color of the one we received is way lighter than the one illustrated. I specifically want a color close to that shown to match our new kitchen cabinets. Right away upon using it AS a cutting board, small chips started coming off of the cutting surface and with just over a month of use, the board is now warped from being rinsed off under warm tap water so that it wobbles from side to side, definitely not what you want to happen when you are trying to cut something. Lastly, be aware that these boards are made of multiple pieces of wood glued together, ours is 4 pieces. I doubt this board will last half as long as the bamboo board it replaced."

When he's done, they get in line to steal the Kong and the lucky one will spend several minutes working on it just in case there's any left.<br /><br />By the end of the afternoon, I am choking on the odor that rises at regular intervals from under my desk in nearly visible clouds of pure dog fart stench. By the time we get home, even the puppy will stop in his tracks every few minutes and startle at his own rear end, not entirely sure what's going on back there but knowing it's probably not good. By the end of the evening I am swearing to myself once again that tomorrow, no matter how desperate I am to occupy him and get some work done, I won't give this stuff to the puppy and turn him into a 6.5lb tactical nuke.<br /><br />I think today was the last time he'll be getting it, and the rest of the can is going in the trash.

Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"

I have eaten various flavors including the brown sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.<br /><br />The maple flavor was bland and chemically, and although it was sweet-ish, I really couldn't detect the flavor of brown sugar. It did, however, have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.<br /><br />In addition, the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for breakfast. It requires, at a minimum, two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.<br /><br />I was not enamored with this product, and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However, as part of a variety pack, I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal, but do not have the time to cook it from scratch."

One packet barely does anything to put a dent in your hunger.  The taste was just okay and not as good as other instant oatmeals I've tried.<br /><br />You can cook quick oats in the microwave in about the same time, add your own brown sugar and cinnamon and a bit of salt, and it will taste worlds better.  Make it with milk instead of water, and it will be even richer.  I might use these instant oatmeal packets on a road trip, but other than that I'd rather make my own on the stovetop.  For the extra few minutes, it's worth the greatly improved taste and texture."

I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.<br /><br />First of all, it tastes different. More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken. Next time I'll try Strawberries & Cream and see if it's still awesome."

Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is ""bad"" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of ""real"" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be ""artificial"" and ""thick"".  ""Thick"", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent ""real theaters"" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste."

I feel that the hazelnut additive was more dominant than the taste of the coffee, and even that was quite weak.  I did not find the flavoring nutty either; rather unnatural tasting.  I generally have my coffee with the addition of half-and-half only; it is quite possible the people who enjoy this are accustomed to using syrups which might compensate for the blandness of this coffee.  Speaking of syrups, if you like hazelnut then I'd recommend instead a hazelnut syrup or liqueur added to a better coffee.  I found no advantage to the whole-bean either; I've certainly had better pre-ground Folger's coffee.  This is the second time I've both tried and been disappointed by the Eight O'Clock brand, and so I am beginning to suspect that I was not merely the victim of an old or otherwise bad batch."

We have three people who drink coffee here, it was gone in 2 weeks.<br /><br />I was upset about it gone so soon, but felt some liquid left behind in the bottle; unfortunately the nozzle can't be removed due to a lock system it has; once it's on, its on for good!  I took a butter knife to open the cap and to my surprise there was enough liquid there for at least 5 more cups of coffee!<br /><br />On top of that the second bottle kept clogging even with twice daily use.  And now Amazon had raised the price!  I decided to go with the plain creamer this time, much more economical.  I will test and review it as soon as I finish the first bottle I hope it works better for us.<br /><br />It very pricey, sure no mess, no hassle if you've got loads of money there's really nothing to worry about.

The first sip was good, and I would probably have given it 3 or 4 stars... but then the after-taste kicked in.  Maybe it's the Ginseng or maybe it's the Guarana, but whatever it is...it's bitter and kind of chemically-tasting.<br /><br />One co-worker added flavored creamer, and it was tolerable, but not good enough to accept a 2nd box free.<br /><br />Our box did not include any over-packed or poorly sealed cups, as the other reviewer experienced, although we have experienced that from time to fime with other manufacturers."

Because I bought them and 4 out of the first 10 cups used blew open inside my Keurig brewer, blowing hot water and coffee grounds all over the inside of my brewer and all over my countertop.<br /><br />I can't say what the problem was - maybe I just got a bad batch of K-Cups, but for there to be that many defective cups in one box was very odd.  I've never, ever had that happen with any other K-Cups by Green Mountain or any other company.<br /><br />Anyone wanna buy a box and a half of these?  :-)"

However, it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I couldn't grow accustomed to.  I ate three boxes, trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me, before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories weren't worth it.  I added butter, flavorings, parmesan cheese, but no luck. Too bad you can't return unused boxes!<br /><br />I ended up giving the rest of it away.  A very expensive taste test!"

I couldn't really taste the nuts or the fruit because of all the glucose syrup (the second ingredient on the list - honey would have been a much tastier sweetening option, but they only used a tiny bit of honey) and all of the bits of puffed white rice (again just another form of sugar) overpowers any other tastes. All I tasted was sugar and bland white rice. I did give it two stars because the bar did have a lot of nuts. Too bad I couldn't taste them. A much tastier option is the Kind brand fruit and nut bars. Theirs are also gluten-free, and they use honey as the primary sweetener and use the sweetener more sparingly, so that you can really taste the nuts and fruit. Amazon sells that brand too, and I'll be going back to that brand. These two are my faves from them:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYF0"">KIND Bar Nut Delight, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYEQ"">KIND Bar Almond & Apricot, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />Thought I'd give the Eat Natural brand a try just for variety, but it reminded me that just because something is natural, doesn't mean it's good for you. Too much glucose is not good for anyone. And remember, hemlock is natural too. That's certainly not good for you either... :)"

After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend."

The Gold Medal Seasoning Flavacol is much better. I will not get again. I have adjusted by not cutting the salt portion then adding the Gold Medal Seasoning by hand that Works better. also others have talked about old maid. that comes from the Popper design. I also had issues with those Cheaper poppers & 4oz. poppers -That's why we upgraded to the professional Brand, Gold Medal, you will pay a tad bit more, but its worth it because parts can be replaced & fixed easily + it can pop ALL day with out issues + better product (popcorn)"

Just looking at it made my 50 year old heart slow down.  Plus, we did not hear a choir of angels singing the Halleluja Chorus when we ate it; it was mediocre popcorn with many unpopped kernels. My own fault - I should have known that, like sausage, its better not to know how ""movie theater"" popcorn is made (hint: yellow food dye is essential). We cannot bring ourselves to eat this again."

The popcorn is great and the convenience of having pre-measured packs is very handy, it lowers the risks of contaminated product and guarantees freshness. However, something is wrong with the case I received. I just went through my remaining stock and threw away another 5 packs that were leaking oil. I then washed the oil mess off of what was left and tossed one more that wasn't sealed on the popcorn. This is after I tossed 7 away a month after buying the case. I had started organizing my pantry and noticed oil everywhere, the source being the corner of box of popcorn. Not a fun clean-up job. I had forgotten about it until today, when I had noticed oil all over again.<br /><br />The bottom edge of the packaging seems to weaken and develop points that ""crack"" open.<br /><br />So out of my case of 24, I've thrown away 12 and used 3, that's ridiculous in my opinion. It just might be cheaper to buy it elsewhere and avoid the waste."

You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;<br /> - Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.<br /> - The generic term ""natural and artificial color"" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.<br /> - No ""best by"" or expiration date on the package<br /><br />For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley-Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you."

After reading some of the reviews about the quality of the popcorn, I chose to give it a chance, price being one of my primary reasons for ordering and the automatic re-order feature.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  Only about 2/3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size.  The product tastes really good, what you're able to get from the package.  By the time you figure the amount of unpopped kernels, you would be much better off spending a little more money for a premium product."

The taste of the popcorn is great, but at least 25% of the popcorn does not pop. The kernel cather is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch. I will try other brands because to Me that is just too much unpopped kernels."

My initial thought was that it was ""stale""  though in date, and both of us (hubby and self) got an upset stomach from eating it, like you do at the movies if you add their ""butter"". I would return this if I could I've had it since July, and just opened the pack last night) and would not recommend it, at least not for the big home popcorn machines. AND, has a higher calorie count and fat count than the Countrytime, too! (Sort of explains the upset stomach, I guess!)"
29626,B000PDY3P0,A1O0TDF3ZLR46Y,2/16/12,1,1,2,Poor Quality,I believe that this product is old/expired or being stored incorrectly.  Only about half the kernels popped and the kernels that did pop had an odd chewy/stale texture to them.  I would not recommend buying from this company.

These will certainly clear your sinuses, but quality is poor.  These would best be described as one part tiny, stale peanut and four parts crunchy wasabi coating dumped into 2 one pound bags.  Learn from my mistake: pay a little more and get less for higher quality in a tin.<br /><br />On a positive note, the vendor was prompt with the shipping.  Their other products are probably good, but this one is not."

This tea just does not deliver the mint like other brands do.  I find this to be problematic when I bought the tea specifically for this purpose.  I confess, it could be that this tea just does not like cold brewing, but that would make it unlike every other tea I have ever bought.<br /><br />If you wish to enjoy the tea as a cold brew, look elsewhere."

What about a warm flat red bull? IMO, That's pretty close to this flavor, except it not nearly as syrupy as a red bull. Some may like that, others may not... I'll be surprised if the odds are better than 50/50 in either direction."

I thought that it wouldn't be too much of a reach to try the ""Green Thunder"" Mio Energy. I really, really did not like it. While I appreciate the caffeine and the B vitamins I greatly prefer the Black Cherry flavor. To me ""green Thunder"" tastes like green apple flavored medicine... very bad medicine.<br /><br />So of the flavors that I have tried<br /><br />Lemonade (Mio Liquid) - Very good - it has become one of my preferred drinks - easily 5 stars<br /><br />Fruit Punch (Mio Liquid) - Good but not great flavor - a little too artificial tasting - 4 stars<br /><br />Black Cherry -(Mio Energy) - I like it but I have had better tasting cherry drinks - I prefer it over ""Vitamin Squeeze"" 4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />Green Thunder - (Mio Energy) - Tastes like medicine - easily my least favorite flavor - 2 stars (I added a star because of the caffeine)"

Much to my surprise it tasted like an energy drink. If you think Mountain Dew and Red Bull taste the same you are nuts. I am not a fan to the taste of energy drinks that is the reason of the low score. To finish the bottle I have mixing it with Jagermeister.

29985,B000GB25LA,A1CB7TWXNEWBPJ,12/22/07,0,0,2,Disappointing,The rooibos is fine but the Early Grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed. Tastes more like a perfumed tea than a balanced blend emulating the classic black tea version. I've had very fine rooibos versions of Early Grey so I know it can be done.
29993,B000DZFMEQ,A1ASH1LE6HZ3Y3,10/30/09,1,1,2,Dated,"I purchased a case of this bread mix because my daughter has celiac and I find it so hard to find products at a reasonable price. I have made 3 out of the 6 packages and only 1 turned out.  There is no date on the yeast packet so on the last one I finally decided to use my own yeast and that did rise properly.  My packs are dated May 22, 2010 but like I said the yeast has no date on it like other products I have bought.  My bar code is 93709 30060.  So needless to say when I thought I was saving money it actually cost me just the same price as when I show at the store.  I will continue to look for products on the website.  Thank you for letting me vent a bit."
30009,B000DZFMEQ,A1YAREUKQU7KLX,3/17/10,2,3,2,Tastes Great BUT check out the SUGAR content,"Yes, people will like Pamela's gluten free bread mix.  I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix.  9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)!  This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.  I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes.  I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable.  Just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up.<br /><br />:-)"
30024,B000DZFMEQ,A1MWEPZ2KS2NFM,7/31/11,0,0,2,No longer the baking mix that I used to love!,"When my son and I were diagnosed with Celiac's Disease, I was on the hunt for a bread mix that would make good bagels. I finally found it with Pamela's baking mix. Always enjoying the texture and taste up until January 2011. When I baked up some bagels with the new batch something changed in their mix...and I just couldn't quite figure it out. The color was lighter and the bagels would no longer rise as they used to. The smell was nauseating while it baked and left me with a bad aftertaste and sour stomach. The texture was not chewy and the bagels did not have that beautiful golden brown color to them anymore. I was so disappointed and upset that they changed their mix which was Amazing just the way it was!  The company may receive their flour from another manufacture or they may have changed flour ratio. Whatever they have done, PLEASE change the flour back to the way it used to be! You have lost a dedicated customer! Such a Shame! =("

GF Pantry had all the attributes of white bread, unlike Pamelas, first it was actually white, it's fluffy and it tastes like white bread.  So anyway I will be buying GF Pantry from here on."

When I looked at the ingreadents it did say say wheat free, but now where did it say that there may be some dairy.  When I got the package it said it may contain dairy."
30231,B000DZFMEQ,A15CKILZAJWWIZ,1/11/09,2,2,2,Disappointed,"Since learning my husband has celiac disease, he hasn't been able to eat pizza with us on homemade pizza nights. It used to be a treat. So I was excited when I first tried the bread mix thinking he could enjoy pizza again. However, the dough never seems to bake throughout; it always turns out gummy. We've tried letting it rise even longer than the hour recommended, even that didn't help. I still have a few bags left so I'm going to try something other than pizza."
30270,B000DZFMEQ,A3ROM407ZIPKAS,9/18/10,1,1,2,Too sweet!,I don't understand why Pamela's has to over compensate by using so much sweetener in their bread mix.  If I wanted a sweet bread I would add my own sugar!  This is not a bread to have eggs and ham with.  It taste more like a dessert.  There are better brands of gluten free bread mix out there. Don't waste your money on this one.
30313,B005DDCKJ8,A1MK24P9SUXC39,8/5/12,0,0,2,Not So Good Bars,"I have tried these bars in the past but was very disappointed with this product, I ordered, went to eat the bars and they were covered with a white film and crumbled.  Amazon was great and understood my problem and sent another order.  This order was also covered with a white film and crumbled.  I wasnt going to do a 3rd time.  Kind of turned me off on ordering this kind again, not sure what the problem was - the date was 8/13 so i dont understand unless it was that batch."

30333,B005DDCKJ8,A38T11B8942QS7,11/16/11,0,0,2,Terrible taste,"I noticed that some people said that eating one was enough, but that's probably because of the taste. I've tried two other flavors of it before, one was chocolate, and I never liked them at all. I don't understand why some people say that it tastes like a candy bar, it looks really pretty, but then when you actually it bite into, it's terrible, b/c it's all mushy inside. Maybe buy one to try it, but don't buy in bulk unless you're sure you like it"
30344,B005DDCKJ8,A13F33RF9FEJCV,7/16/11,0,0,2,Found these really tasteless,This product sounded great.  I ordered a box and really could only eat one.  I took the box into work and found that my opinion was shared.  They just tasted empty of flavor.  very disappointing.
30356,B005DDCKJ8,A2UUG9XN31XLU6,2/26/11,0,0,2,There are better flavors,This is my least favorite of these bars.  The white coating is dry and way too sweet.  Stick with the peanut butter and chocolate varieties.
30363,B005DDCKJ8,A3AZLDHN6JF8YW,10/4/10,0,0,2,Disappointing,"Might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor. Maybe the other flavors are better, but definitely steer clear of this - not worth anything near $1+ a bar."

30393,B004LOJGBU,AFR0HC8Y1KB37,1/30/12,0,2,2,Not for Me,"A famous TV doctor recommended using Turffle sea salt on popcorn as a healthy snack. I tried this but just didn't like the taste. Guess I am not a truffle lover. Others may find this a wondeful product. It is a matter of taste, not anything else."
30399,B003X7S45U,A1A36OARN9HW4V,10/31/11,1,1,2,has a bite to it,"This isn't nearly as good as the Dunkin Donuts Pumpkin Spice coffee I've been getting at Wal-Mart.  I particularly didn't like the bitter aftertaste that I couldn't adjust out of it.  No matter how I brewed it or what I put in it, that bite didn't go away."
30402,B003X7S45U,A2BI8390N0S75Q,10/18/12,0,0,2,Sadly not what I was hoping for,So I'm a deployed soldier and there's a disappointing lack of any pumpkin here. I bought this so I could have that nice fall pumpkin coffee experience. I was sad to discover that this tastes not evenly remotely like pumpkin. The shipping time was the only thing that pleased me about this order.
30419,B003X7S45U,A1Y33TIS90NSIK,11/16/10,0,0,2,No pumpkin flavor,I was so excited to order and receive this coffee but I was disappointed once I brewed a cup.  The Vanilla flavor came out but I tasted no pumpkin spice.  There was no aroma of pumpkin...nothing.  It has a unique flavor which is good but it just was not what I was looking for.

Being Maine Coons with crafty little paws and ambitious little brains, they managed to pick out the Avoderm bits and eat those first.<br /><br />Yum, a hit! It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.<br /><br />But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.<br /><br />So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down."
30448,B007M833A2,A15JT52I2XKUY9,10/13/12,1,1,2,BACK-ORDER,I have been a loyal POP chip customer for a while now and wanted to try some of the new flavors. I ordered the variety pack on Sept 15th and it said in stock. Now exactly a month later I have still not even received and ETA on when they might be shipped. I am very disappointed!!!
30453,B007M833A2,A1VQVOI82NQ341,8/25/12,0,0,2,I'm just not a fan of the flavor.,"What can I say, I gave them a shot. The assortment of chips they send with this pack is well shipped and stored, however I just wasn't a fan of the taste of the product. I tried many times to eat Pop Chips with salsas, dips, tuna, etc... and I just couldn't get used to the taste. In my opinion they are extremely bland, even when well seasoned. Again, I was impressed with the product packaging and nutrition, just not the taste. I'm a chip junkie, so I was pretty bummed when I didn't like them. I can suffer through baked chips, but Pop Chips aren't for me."
30465,B0026PENE6,A36T0VWWSI373N,7/4/10,3,3,2,Like eating a candle.,"My wife bought a ""Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate"" bar while on vacation in DC. Opening the package brought forth a waxy looking bar with no chocolate (or any other) smell at all. Tasting the bar was like eating a brown candle without a wick. Not good at all. Biting the 'chocolate' has about the same consistency as biting, I don't know, perhaps an old dried out bar of soap. Doesn't seem to melt in your mouth at all.<br /><br />Poland may be notable for a lot of fine products, this sadly, is not one of them. The label states ""Simply the Finest Chocolates on Earth"", but at best this could only be promotional propaganda from the bad old Warsaw Pact, Soviet domination days.<br /><br />The label also notes that the product is ""Imported Exclusively by: Global Brands LLC"" whose website states ""You won't believe it retails for $1.00!"" Well, I do, and even at a dollar, I would have been dissapointed.<br /><br />On the plus side, well, you do get a lot of it."
30471,B0026PENE6,A852I21I0KLM0,5/23/12,0,0,2,Meh,"I will not buy this again. This tasted more like milk chocolate than dark chocolate to me. It was way to sweet! It is not ""quality"" chocolate in my opinion. It tasted like that cheap chocolate they put in those colorful dots that come thin plastic holders. Actually, I prefer that chocolate to this. If you are looking for real dark chocolate this is not for you."
30478,B004P7V8VE,A2Y4S4CNGKF21S,10/24/11,1,2,2,They changed the recipe,"I used to get these a few years back, and they were amazing. Now I've bought them a few times and they taste different, like they're now skimping on something. They taste really... dry, kinda plain. I have a feeling this recipe change had something to do with the fact that the flavor blasted ones are now available in the huge boxes. I'm sure they're wanting to save money on some ingredients when they're selling in bulk. Will not be buying again."
30491,B000GFYRI0,A2FP2CXLX5BVJ3,8/27/11,1,2,2,Not a fan - weird spice in it,I don't care for Bigelow's version of their Spiced Chai. They don't list their ingredients on the box - but this definitely has something strange in it. I bought it because I couldn't find my regular brand - but I'll be giving these away. :(
30492,B000GFYRI0,AHKPZ11JT110F,4/25/11,1,2,2,Does not taste like a true Chai,"This is a really nice dessert tea. It is reminds me of Celestial Seasonings' ""Vanilla Hazelnut"", but with a much stronger nut bouquet and flavor. It also has a very strong caramel type smell.<br /><br />Since I wanted a more authentic chai flavor, this particular tea does not ""pass muster"". My first thought upon smelling this was ""does this have chicory in it?"" It could also have the roasted carob found in the vanilla hazelnut tea mentioned above, but chicory is more likely. It should not be advertised as chai.<br /><br />Currently I brew two different chais together (Tazo and India Tea's Cardemom Chai) together. After that I  put the seeds of two cardamom pods, one star anise, a chunk of ginger and a little freshly ground pepper before adding milk and honey. I was hoping I could just one tea bag upon receipt of this order. I'll keep this, but my search for the perfect Chai in one bag is still on!<br /><br />This tea also seems very sweet. I don't know if they added Stevia or something similar, but I didn't need to add as much sweetener as I add to my other Chai concoction."
30518,B001EQ59W8,A9M84KC79ZH9Q,1/6/11,0,3,2,texture is great but the flavor? uuhh,"Wow. I had bought it wondering what turkish delight was after watching narnia of course. I ordered it through a turkish grocery website but figured the review here would be more helpful as it's the same brand. I love the smell because I like rose scented things, and the texture i thought was good, but the taste? It was, like other reviewers have said, eating rose potpourri. I just can't get past it. I'm sure it's an acquired taste but I don't think I'll ever get used to it. Even an hour later I could still taste it faintly and I keep shuddering lol. My 4 year old wants to eat the whole box. But then again, she's positive she's a princess so she should be eating flowery stuff. :P Maybe sometime I'll be brave enough to try a different flavor, but I'm afraid the lemon will taste like a lemon peel."
30525,B002PH1WB2,A2WOB6TD0DHM23,8/14/12,2,2,2,Arrived spoiled,"I like the Maruman brand and was thrilled to find that this miso was organic, so I didn't hesitate to order. However, the product arrived spoiled, probably due to warping during shipping of the ultrathin plastic tub. Disappointing."
30527,B00080ODWI,A3PRABNQ31OVBS,5/9/07,1,1,2,ok but a bit too strong in fragrance oils for my taste,the tea seemed fine but the fragrance oils were too strong for my taste.  i could not taste the tea.  they need to be more subtle with a green tea.  too bad because i am really looking for a good one to replicate the one i usually drink from france which i cannot get any longer.
30529,B006WJHOX4,A2N7V6NY8ZXGMA,9/12/12,1,1,2,Not as fresh dated as I get at the Stores and made in Mexico,"I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the ""Use By Date"" at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it.  I bought Kellogs Rasin Bran at Sam's Club last week, and it has a date for June 2013.  The boxes I just got from Amazon are dated for February 2013, so I will have to use them up first.  It is mid-Sept 2012 now, so there is still time to use the 3 boxes.  But dissapointed that they are closer dated than at the stores here. Also, the Box from Sam's shows Battle Creek, Michigan - and these from Amazon show being from Mexico. Based on this and other reviews here mentioning Kellog's ingredients being altered, I think I will change to another brand and cancel my Subscribe and Save."

No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging."
30707,B007M83302,AWB39CSUQXSB3,10/2/10,1,1,2,On the strong side,The flavors of these are a bit on the strong side. Wish I hadn't bought so many...I thought I would love them since parmesan and garlic are two of my favorite flavors. Oh well...

I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, ""potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)"".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best."
30768,B007M83302,AOZ2O1XRJKWI3,8/3/10,2,3,2,Not A True Potato Chip,"Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to ""Pringles"".  If you have ever eaten ""Funyuns"" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try ""Grandma Utz"" potato chips, a true potato chip."
30775,B007M83302,A3H4FFQ4AYZORO,9/30/12,0,0,2,Not my cup of tea,Salt and vinegar is just ok to me.<br />They are not in the same league of utz Salt and vinegar potato chips.<br /><br />Just ok<br /><br />Not enough taste to them.
30805,B007M83302,A2YDU3RZB63VXW,1/25/11,45,52,2,"Holy SALT, Batman!","We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."
30810,B007M83302,A25BDPF8J9WA21,6/23/09,4,4,2,Decent,"These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like Lays. The cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health."
30836,B007M83302,A350NHMBGYXEDP,2/26/12,0,0,2,so disappointing,"I love sweet potato and especially sweet potato chips. When I tried the original popchips, I was surprised by how good the taste and texture was, so I bought this in bulk, thinking it would be excellent because of the company and because I love sweet potatoes of course.<br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For some reason, the sweet potato chip they've created tastes like cardboard despite having the same texture (cross between rice cake and chip), added with a dash of salt. That's it. I can't describe it any other way than a ""bland blah taste with salt""<br /><br />I wish I had gotten the parmesean garlic or the original instead."
30880,B007M83302,AJ2FDNZ3COBFN,1/30/12,0,0,2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I had been eying the Popchips brand for some time but I they seemed too expensive and I passed. So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."

Way too much sodium.<br />The cheddar flavor is kind of like different-shaped cheetos, quite tasty.<br />Parmesan garlic on the other hand is terrible. Extremely garlicky with no parmesan taste at all, and too salty."
30939,B007M83302,A2O7EQPGUWFS7H,8/9/11,0,0,2,Taste good - but not as good at Weight Watchers Brand,"These pop chips are satisfying and good for a snack, but not what I expected.  They do not taste as good, crisp or as light as the Weight Watchers brand that is so hard to find in stock.  I wish Amazon could carry the actual Weight Watcher's Brand chips - They are the best snack out there."
30960,B007M83302,A36YQLW5FDZG68,4/24/11,0,0,2,Didn't satisfy the void of baked salt & vinegar chips for me,"I was really excited to try these out as salt & vinegar has always been my favorite flavor. I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice."

I will not purchase this original flavor again. However I can't complain because I got the 3 ounce bag for only $1.00 at the store while they were on sale. I tried the BBq flavor and they are delicious. I bought the sea salt & vinegar, and cheddar but haven't tried those yet."

But unfortunately I don't like them... at all!  I've tried Salt & Pepper, Original, BBQ, Salt & Vinegar; but these are just awful!  I've loved all the other flavors and I like Sour Cream & Onion chips normally, so I'm not sure why I dislike these so much.  I'm hoping I can somehow return them."
31175,B007M83302,A39H72H8NPM0R,8/8/10,0,1,2,Family loved them but this is MY review,"I have to be upfront and tell you my family loves these but I do not. I do not like baked Lays or Pringles either. This product reminded me of them, not the same but similar. My son wanted me to try them and then invest in the company. I am glad so many people like them but I will pass on eating them and it looks like it is a private company.... So no stock either."
31191,B007M83302,ABSFFH7ECSE49,1/26/12,0,2,2,Lacks flavor,"Because I like sweet potatoe fries, I thought I would like these.  But, I found them to lack flavor.  There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag."

31203,B007M83302,A3A90CELVLOUP6,6/8/11,0,3,2,Did NOT like the taste of these.,"I like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips. The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the ""modified"" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said ""I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again."" My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain."

It's been over 2 weeks since I made this purchase and it hasn't even shipped yet; and when I bought this it said it was in stock, so I don't know what's taking so long.  I don't think I'll buy this again because the wait is ridiculous."
31208,B007M83302,A16UH2O4UVYOJZ,2/23/10,1,5,2,Dissappointing,"To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips."
31209,B007M83302,A1YGDKJ7CAOQN3,9/16/10,0,4,2,why did the price go up for these popchips,that is so unfair. I was a faithful customer now i have to go buy them somewhere else . Why Amazon!!!
31210,B007M83302,AQNLG42HPS5KD,4/18/09,1,6,2,Packaging is misleading,"I bought a big bag of these and I don't mind the strong pepper taste. What I do mind is the bag implies these are Potato chips.<br /><br />There is absolutely no potato taste left in this snack; if you like eating extremely salty onion powder this snack is for you.<br /><br />Going by the bag I expected: REAL potatos, a little oil and baking, finally sprinkled with salt and pepper only? Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.<br /><br />If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!<br /><br />--VS"

I disagree. About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos, but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet, these will probably due."
31238,B007M83302,A28WXDXJA1P0MC,1/24/12,1,1,2,"These definitely taste like ""diet"" chips","After reading several reviews from people apparently on diets I now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good. These are bland, have a weird texture and aren't very good. I will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away. I ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry. They are low in calories and low in taste. Pass."

I did this because I was having trouble with the waffles I made being soggy. I don't think it would work with out eggs, or egg replacer, as it's just rice flour.

I tried using it as a spread on a ham wrap and it was too much for one wrap. Too salty for me but then I use Mrs Dash a lot so I guess I'm kind of sensitive with salt. It's nice though that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so you can take it with you. I thought the taste was okay and the texture thin, not watery, but just thin.<br /><br />Take care all"

You cannot return this item, so your stuck with 10 boxes of them.  $30 down the drain.  2nd food item I've received from Amazon in the last few months that was stale tasting.  I think your local grocer is a safer bet for this type food item.  That is, if you can find it locally.  At least you can try a smaller quantity and return it if neccessary."

Unfortunately I didn't have time to go out to pick up lunch, so I turned to the vending machine.  Luckily, a Hormel Beef Steak and Peppers was available!  It did its job, it filled me.  However, it was disgusting.  It was a globby, mushy, brown mess.  I did not taste like beef and peppers.  It was more like a beef gravy that was put over way overcooked noodles.  But, like an earlier poster said, it's GREAT for dieters!  I often eat Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers.  Usually they're pretty tasty, but they're very tiny.  The Hormel meal was only 210 calorie and significantly more filling than the Healthy Choice one."

But they're too sweet.  The sugary taste and texture of this brand of dried strawberries makes me feel like I'm eating candied strawberries.  This wasn't what I expected from the description.  I should have paid more attention to the other review that complains of over-sweetening.  Don't buy these, unless you want to eat strawberry candy; buy another brand which lets you enjoy the natural strawberry flavor and texture more."

It was so good and it rivaled the chai at my favorite coffee house (NOT Char-bucks).  I always LOVED it, and enjoyed a cup each morning as I braced for the coming day.  I did, that is, up until several months ago. They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe, but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.  I even thought that I had detergent stuck in my mugs from the dishwasher, so I was very diligent in cleaning them before I made a cup.  It didn't help.<br /><br />The flavor was stronger with the spiced chai, so I started getting only vanilla.  Unfortunately, I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.<br /><br />I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening, I have reduced the amount I use even more.  That horrible flavor is still there, so I know it isn't related to the way it's mixed.<br /><br />I am very disappointed because, like I said, it was my favorite beverage in the morning.  After trying so many different things over the last 4 months, I have finally selected another brand to try out.  I hope it is as good as this one used to be."

I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order.  I don't think this was an Amazon fault, since the flat was pre-packaged and I think Amazon simply shipped the flat as they received it from the manufacturer.

That said--my second shipment had two VERY badly dented cans--but the rest were only slightly dented.  (This compared to my first shipment where every can was moderately dented).  Since I am using this for dog food--I have no problem using.  I just don't like to see this product sold as if it has no problems.  I am glad it is available though since there is such a pumpkin shortage.<br /><br />I'd like to update--my third shipment had only a couple of cans slightly dented.  I don't know if I just got lucky this time, or whatever issues there were have been worked out.<br /><br />That said, I am upping my review to 5 stars--however as other reviews have noted, the pumpkin is more watery than other canned pumpkin I have used in the past.  For my purposes that is fine.<br /><br />Taking my review back down to 2 stars.  I just received a shipment with extremely dented cans.  Too much trouble to return--and I will use them to feed my dogs.  I really hate that I don't feel like I have another choice right now."

They were packed together so it didn't look like the damage took place during shipping.<br /><br />Edited note:<br />Today is May 30, 2009 and I just wanted to post that Amazon wrote to me and told me this problem has been rectified. I'm happy about that because I need to get these for my dog and at times they are hard to find. Plus it's a great product."

It's likely less watery than fresh pumpkin puree, but definitely more watery than Libby's or the generic brand at my grocery store.<br /><br />The texture upon opening this organic one was smooth while the other was irregular. It made my pies taste a bit bland as well, but I also made a mistake with the crust (too much water) so that had a hand in my pie disappearing in two days rather than one.<br /><br />I really liked the art, though. The label. It's nice.<br /><br />Basically, it won't make a fantastic pie, but it'll do. Especially if you would like organic. I suggest straining through coffee filters (placed over a mesh colander) overnight or longer."

I read that dents aren't a big deal unless they are at the seams of the cans (which most of these are at the top or the bottom). Would have been a good deal, but I'm definitely disappointed.  Like other reviews said, these dents don't appear to be from them being shipped as cans that were even packaged in the middle were dented, makes you think they are selling the companies ""seconds"" or something."

You also know that one can only stash so many cans of pumpkin, and that somewhere in the spring most supermarkets start running out of canned pumpkin and can't get more or stop ordering it (understandably).  So, I was happy to see this product on Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers experienced, many of the cans arrived dented. In fact ALL 12 CANS were dented, most severely so.  Thing is, unless Amazon wrapped the cans to the case flats, this was not an Amazon issue.  The case pack was well buffered in a larger box that was completely undamaged; neither the shrink-wrap nor the flat were damaged; and even the inner cans in the case were bashed up.<br /><br />This clearly indicates that the manufacturer -- or whomever wrapped the cases -- shipped already and obviously damaged cans.  I checked the product listing and there is no mention of these being seconds.  My message to manufacturer, distributor and/or Amazon: check the product or change the description so people know they are taking their chances.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon customer service came through with an offer to replace or refund.  I'm giving this one more shot for my dog's sake, and will hope for the best."

WRONG!  6 of the 12 were badly dented all along the upper rim seams.  Amazon did, however, make good on my order with an exchange.

The cans were obviously not bent or damaged in shipping.  The cans were crated, wrapped in bubble wrap, and packed in an undamaged Amazon shipping box.  It was as if someone picked through the cans and packed dented and bent cans.  I considered returning the order but needed it right away.  I use the pumpkin to moisten dry food for my dog which eats special food for severe allergies.  The pumpkin was fine but the impression created by the vendor with the condition of the cans was not acceptable.  I do not intend to order from this vendor again."

Just disappointing to receive something like this from Amazon.  I know it probably isn't their fault but they are still shipping it from their warehouse.  Would hate to receive other products in this condition. Farmer's Market should be ashamed of themselves. Having said that, I am pleased to receive them and so is my cat!

However, I don't think I would order from them again since 5 of the cans were really badly dented.  Not just a little ding here or there.  Bad dents to the point of being afraid to eat it.

Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation.  Yes, I was desperate for pumpkin.  It's watery.  It's not solid packed.  And using the same ingredients I always do in the dish I used it, it was sub par.  I have since sent the product back mainly because of the dented situation - otherwise, I probably would have given it to a food bank or something - they don't take dented cans either and rightfully so!  Amazon took it back and I'm sure will be crediting my money.  I WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER COMMENTS before I purchased this.  Beware of dented cans."

The consistency is, well, for lack of better word, inconsistent.<br /><br />Sometimes we received firm canned pumpkin like the kind I grew up baking with, and other times we received a runny, really messy sort I would call puree.  I contacted the company and they said something about having an extraordinarily wet season.  Never did figure out what that had to do with the processing of the pumpkin...<br /><br />I do not know how other organic pumpkins fare or even if there is competition in the line of product.  Some cans were badly damaged in shipping which was a surprise and quite unfortunate.  Amazon's Customer Service was stellar as always and replaced what was damaged.<br /><br />As far as the consistencies go, if I still have the photos I took of the runny stuff, I will post them.  It's quite different from the firmer canned pumpkin!  I would recommend this for buying a lot of (for cats and dogs when it's a really good price), but honestly I don't use this for baking anymore because I never really know what I'll get."

The sugar free version averages 12.5 calories per piece or 50 calories per 16.5 grams, which about 4 pieces. Thatt's 20% fewer calories per piece.<br /><br />They are slightly softer as the regular Rios and much less sweet and much less flavorful. In terms of flovaor, there is no comparison -- the regular are rich; the sugarfree are bland, emphasis on the ""bla"". Eating these is a big sacrifice for 20% fewer calories. If you want to reduce caloric intake, the if you can work up the discipline to skip one piece for every 4 you eat, you total enjoyment might be much greater with the 20% fewer calories.<br /><br />They are made with real coffee and milk and Splenda sweetener, and other things.<br /><br />If you have partial fillings or crowns or braces, etc. you will want to avoid chewing these even though the are sotftler than the sugared version.<br /><br />For more general review on the Rio coffee candy, se my review of Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels."

Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle?

Though it to mushy to be beef. The inside is brown and does not taste like beef.<br /><br />Anyways the beef is little chunks of beef in the SAUCE (not in the ravioli).<br /><br />This is not worth it. There is no cheese BTW.

The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere."

Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand."

I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!

32618,B002JWZVWO,A2TYX3SLJWI610,10/4/12,1,1,2,Disappointed by the New Formula Change,"I loved this product and participated in the subscription service. However, my last shipment came in a newly designed box and the formula of the coconut/guava mixture had changed.  There is more guava juice now, which I find overwhelming.  The sugar content has also increased.  I've had to purchase plain coconut water to mix with my last order to tone down the guava flavor.  I am not a fan of the change and plan to cancel my monthly subscription.  Beware if you were a fan of the old true splash of guava formula."
32620,B002JWZVWO,APVK8GGSSUDCE,1/27/10,1,1,2,Too salty for my taste,"Just to give this drink a good chance, I stuck it in the fridge for a couple of days, shook it really well, and tried it straight, without ice.  The color was okay, the consistency was okay, not much of a smell.<br /><br />Then I tasted it, and the first thing that came to mind was, it's salty.  I had my wife try it as well, and she had the same feeling.  I looked at the product info, and it states that it has 5% of the USRDA for sodium, which is too much for a drink, in my opinion, especially a ""Coconut Water"".  Something like Gatorade, which is for electrolyte replenishment, I can forgive, but not for this.<br /><br />I then thought more about the taste, besides the saltiness, and what I really had to conclude was that the the mix of flavors didn't do anything for me.  No real sweetness from the coconut, no sourness from the guava.<br /><br />Overall, Not crazy about it.<br /><br />Now, I do have something positive to say about the container, it held up well, and it's relatively easy to open, although I'd add a ring to the aluminum foil-like pull tab.  But at least the container's mostly paper and potentially better for the environment?"
32621,B002JWZVWO,A2ELZJRD7L5WQT,1/8/10,8,12,2,contains SUGAR and is SMALLER,"Unlike the other coconut water products I've purchased, this one contains sugar and the container is smaller.  These two facts must be stated in the description but I had not noticed till I got the order.  The drink tastes OK if one likes guava."
32641,B002JWZVWO,A2NXAV1SNXWA9H,4/27/10,0,0,2,Watered Down Sports Drink,"This is the latest foray into the ""all natural"" nutritional drinks market. Despite boasting ""real fruit juice"" on the packaging, the flavor is simply too watered down to notice. Having drank plenty of coconut water, this drink has barely more than a hint of it. Most likely, it clashes with the taste of the guava, which is also hardly noticeable. In fact, were it not for the label on the packaging, this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be. Speaking of the which, the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids, sans the accompanying straw. Also, this 8.5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost. Given the price for a pack of 12, it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck. The nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks, however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market. Overall, O.N.E. has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks. While it does offer fairly solid nutritional content, the bland taste and small size does not make this a good value."
32643,B002JWZVWO,A3JPFWKS83R49V,2/3/10,1,2,2,"Good Nutritional Value, but Essentially Flawed","Everyone should drink more water, or so we are told. The problem is that water is plain and boring. It needs some flavor, and many companies have responded to this demand. O.N.E. Coconut water with splash of pink guava is one such product. It contains coconut water along with guava juice for a unique taste.<br /><br />I like the taste of coconut but I am only so- so on the flavor of guava. Still, I decided this drink was worth a try because as long as it emphasized the coconut, it would be fine. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. O.N.E Coconut Water with a splash of guava is misleading in its naming, because you taste more guava than anything. Even then, the taste is rather unexciting. Even lovers of the flavor of guava will likely find this product a letdown.<br /><br />Nutritionally, O.N.E. Coconut water is very good, with low calories and a large dose of vitamin C and electrolytes in each serving, and more potassium than a banana. The sugar content is a little higher than some would prefer, but it isn't too bad and, unlike other sweet drinks, you get a good deal of nutritional trade- off for the sugar. Each time I take a sip and feel dissatisfied, I keep reminding myself of the nutritional benefits.<br /><br />Along with the bland flavor profile, there is one other problem I have with this drink, and that is the packaging. It is sold in a small foil box, which is ordinarily not a problem, but there is no included straw. There is an opening at the top that must be pushed- in to open, but the manufacturer doesn't include a straw. Thus, you have to use a fork or some other device to forge an opening. Then, you must carve out just the right shape for drinking from the box OR have another glass handy in which to pour the liquid.<br /><br />I wanted to like this beverage but when all factors are considered, I must rate O.N.E. Coconut Water with a splash of guava as a below average product. The coconut flavor is masked by the guava, the taste is unexciting, and the packaging is flawed. Yes, you get a good deal of nutrition so the product isn't a complete bomb, but there are other, better tasting products on the market with equally good nutrition, better taste, and more sensible packaging."
32646,B002JWZVWO,A2LDT9BIN9ZBYR,2/20/11,2,4,2,Not very good!!!!,"On the cover, pink guava and coconut sounds very interesting and tasty.<br /><br />It was the complete opposite.<br /><br />My taste is very good and i am not picky at all. I can eat most food on this planet without hesitation.<br /><br />But, the taste on this drink is different. It does not taste good or bad.

However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better."

I am not sure what is going on here as I have been using this dog food for some time now.... but the bag I just opened (from Amazon) is not the same as the last ten bag of this stuff. First off it is a different color??? and second the soft bits are hardly in this bag. The soft bits that are in the bag are hard and crumble in my hand. Now this may not be Amazon fault.... it could have been store wrong... or Purina has change the blend. Either way I am not happy nor is my dog. I will be calling Purina first thing tomorrow morning and ask for my money back and then buy a local bag and see what is what. So right now buyer beware.<br /><br />10/04/2012 Just an update .... called Purina and the are sending me a coupon for a free bag and an additional discount coupon for my trouble .... but it will take 7 to ten days. My wife went to walmart today to get a new bag so my dog will eat again ;-)

This makes me wonder if the plastic molecules will start their leaching process and then we'll be eating plastic :-/ I think I'd rather get glass bottles in a smaller size - the savings isn't that great."

It lacked much maple flavor.  So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked.  We hate it.  It has a very bitter after taste.  I don't know what to do now becuase we don't like the grade B, but the grade A isn't strong enough in flavor."
32732,B0083QJU72,A19RGDJPNZ7NZ,11/4/09,9,31,2,"Great stuff at first, but not for long (see my edit within review)","I liked the flavor of this syrup at first, as did my wife.  It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the ""store-bought"" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br /><br />Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />""People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?""<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking."

Upon receipt I immediately noticed that these are just large rawhide strips with a coating on them. They are not even particularly thick rawhide. Rawhide in any form is very dangerous and you must monitor your dog very closely when they are chewing on these. My Great Dane is not a ""swallow whole"" kind of eater - he tries to chew up even the tiniest training treats before swallowing them, BUT with rawhide strips like these he will chew on the whole piece until it eventually becomes soft, then swallow it. Whole. Then choke it back up, chew some more and swallow it whole again. Repeat until it goes down and stays down. This is not healthy and not very safe and I always have to be poised to remove the offending chunk of soft wet rawhide from his throat as he gags it up. He does love these chews but I have not seen any wonderful changes in his teeth so far with 2 weeks of daily use so it will not be worth the trouble or risk of choking for me to buy more once this bag is gone. I now wish I had gotten the smaller quantity bag so I could be done with these sooner!<br />Edited to add that I finally finished the whole bag and still didnt see any big changes to his teeth or gums. Also, the coating comes off on his white legs and my carpet and they make his breath smell weird (not fresh, kind of medicine like). I will never buy these again."

When I opened the 2nd bag that I purchased, about 1 month later, I found a clump of dirt (approximately 1/2"" in diameter).  I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was ""If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund"".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated ""we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)"".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.  Not sure if they will look into this situation more closely to prevent this problem in the future or not but check product for evidence of dirt if you are purchasing this product in the future.<br /><br />Update (2/27/12) - Davidson's did get back with me and sent me a new bag without charge when filling out the Amazon claim form.

The good ones usually great deep red clear drink with some acidity and a nice mild distinguished aroma. This hibiscus looks great from the moment you open the package. It is clean small flattened flower individual leafs.  The first thing I noticed is the absence of the hibiscus aroma. It smells like an old black tea that has been opened for long time.<br /><br />  Now for the drink, once added to boiling water, the drink looks good. It has a nice deep red color and the drink is clear.... Now for the taste: There was no taste what so ever. Juts a little acetic taste and that's it.<br /><br />  The drink has the expected effect of making your body getting rid of excess water but I couldn't enjoy it as a drink at all. I had to add more of the hibiscus with a lot of sugar to create a drinkable drink.... Well, that's not what I expect from hibiscus drink. I would give it only one star just because of the flavor. I am going to increase it to two stars because I used it as a tea additive to give a nice acetic flavor and the anti-oxidants.<br /><br />  My explanation of the lack of flavor is that they picked the younger hibiscus flowers that have the deep color and acidity but didn't develop the real hibiscus taste yet.  Or maybe they dried it fast in machines that caused it to loose flavor. But looking at the leaves and how thin they are makes me think that is the first one.<br /><br />  I tried other Hibiscus products from Amazon and there were some really good ones."

I wrote to the seller about this matter and through Amazon but I did not receive a response from the seller. In my case, I ordered 6 Equal dispensers which amounts to $17.34 but then I was charged $11.94 for shipping [$1.99 for 'each' dispenser] even though they were shipped together in a single package with very negligible package weight. I asked the seller to perhaps consider [no matter who orders the product] a more reasonable [read: equitable] shipping and handling charge based on the actual weight of the package and the fact that the multiple item order is shipped in one single package, but as I said, and to date, I received no response from the seller.<br /><br />So too, various of these dispensers have tablet jamming problems and you've got to often bang on the thing to get the small tablet out in one piece. Further, it's difficult to find these tablet dispensers in supermarkets, the why of which escapes me, but when they first came out, the dispenser had a small lid on the bottom and the tablets came out intact and freely but when the Equal folks moved to the newer tablet 'click' dispensers, the tablet jamming became a problem and this 'may' account for the Equal folks going with the sweetener 'granule' or sweetener 'powder' packets for their sweetener vs the hard tablet dispensers.<br /><br />I think charging $1.99 for 'each' dispenser but which is shipped in a 'single' package borders on shipping and handling fee inequity. In the future, I'll simply order the dispensers one by one and 'then' I can at least justify the seller shipping and handling charge even though I'll wind up paying the same but it would then have to be sent in multiple packages! I think the seller would do much better in 'adjusting' the shipping fee for multiple item orders that they mail out in one package and based on true mailing weight considerations.<br /><br />Doc Tony"
33319,B001E5E0IS,A35ABG7AY6MC3X,11/30/11,3,5,2,Not My Cup of Tea!,"I have tried many different types of Mate over the last few years. Flavored, unflavored, with herbs, with sweeteners, roasted, and organic. This is the first ""Unsmoked"" Mate that I can recall having tried and it has turned out to be the strangest Mate yet. My taste buds really hated me for sticking with this Mate. I can now say that the bag is finished, the damage is done, but man it really is bad tasting Mate. I gave this stuff and fair try and thought maybe it would grow on me, but like hell! This stuff tastes more like dirt and hay than it does Mate! As for why the taste is off, it is difficult to say what is actually going on. It is entirely different from the traditional taste of Mate. The bad taste has nothing to do with it being ""Organic"", that much I know. I've tried several ""Organic"" brands and this is the only one Ive had a problem with. I toyed with the idea that it may be a bad batch, but I know that's not the case as I've bought two bags of this stuff and it's the same taste. The only obvious problem with this Mate is it being unsmoked. So if you are looking to buy that traditional tasting Mate, look elsewhere. And another problem, perhaps, is a simple issue of it not being aged long enough? I don't know. I've heard that two years is the ideal length of time, but really don't know much about the subject of aging Mate. Anyways, I looked on the website for any information on how long it is aged but found nothing.<br /><br />As for recommendations on other Mate, and really I suggest finding another brand, here are some brands worth looking into; Titrayju (highly recommended), Roapipo (a personal favorite), Taragui, Cruz de Malta, Amanda, Nobleza Guacha, and Rosamante.<br /><br />Rosamante, Cruz de Malta, and Taraqui are all found on Amazon I believe.

I give it an extra star because my child seemed to like it.<br /><br />However, I wouldn't want my children eating these often because when I looked at the nutrition label, I saw that indeed, these cookies are highly processed.  Yes, the first ingredient is whole grain oat flour and rolled oats and whole wheat flour are up there.  So I suppose things could be worse.  The four grams of fiber per serving is nice, though it may come from the inulin rather than the whole grains.  What is not nice is the palm oil, multiple sugars (including corn syrup) and multiple preservatives in the ingredient list.<br /><br />The cookies are individually wrapped and the packaging is probably the most attractive part of the product.<br /><br />For myself or my children, a home baked cookie would be much preferable to these. So would a power bar or a handful of nuts, which would also be more healthy. Or a packaged cookie with fewer preservatives.  I wouldn't purchase these again."

Well, Quaker Oats got the TEXTURE right...<br /><br />These cookies were a TOTAL disappointment.  There's just NO richness to them at ALL - the flavor is mostly a sort of mechanical reference to the taste of oatmeal in a real homemade cookie. Even when licking one of the chocolate chips directly, the chocolate taste just sort of briefly tantalizes then evaporates, and the nut-bits are too small to be noticeable.<br /><br />I won't be looking for these in stores!"

The sugar content of each cookie is 9 grams, so not too bad. The carbohydrates are 26 grams, which is kind of high, at least to me, per cookie.<br /><br />Calorie wise they are 180 calories per cookie.

I like that they are soft-baked.<br /><br />Otherwise I thought they were rather dry and tasteless and they did a lot of crumbling.  The almonds were whole but small and the chocolate was in small chunks but there weren't enough of either to be a very strong taste.  I even thought it could have used more oatmeal which maybe would have kept it from being so crumbly.<br /><br />I guess I was just expecting more of a sweet taste from something with chocolate and almonds.

They do have a slightly chemical taste, but that's typical for this kind of cookie. I would have liked them to be a bit less dry. I found I had to drink a whole bottle of water while I ate just one of these.<br /><br />While they do have slightly more healthy stuff than, say, a normal packaged chocolate chip cookie, (I did like that they had 4 grams of fiber), I just felt myself wishing they would taste slightly better."

I don't know, but this did not taste like any oatmeal cookie I've ever tasted....no cinnamon or brown sugar flavor, just....well, kind of sawdusty.  I couldn't make out the almond and barely tasted the chocolate.  I think on every level this cookie was not a winner.  If I was absolutely desperate to eat something I would probably eat one I suppose, but I definitely would not buy these.<br /><br />Overall, no taste, terrible texture and a disappointment from start to finish.

33353,B007JFMH96,A1E7BYP6JGDUHD,7/23/12,1,1,2,very dry!,"For an oatmeal cookie I was very surprised at how dry these were; usually oatmeal cookies, and particularly commercially produced ones, are super soft.  Definitely needed a glass of milk to get it down.  On the positive side, there were quite a bit of almonds -- larger bits at that -- which are often promised but not delivered.  The chocolate chunks were not plentiful but I didn't mind that as much as I don't like big hunks of chocolate in my cookies; chocolate lovers might be a bit disappointed.  Due to the dryness of this cookie I wouldn't be likely to purchase these in the store as I really prefer a much moister cookie."
33355,B007JFMH96,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,7/30/12,3,4,2,Just make them yourself,"I don't generally buy packaged cookies.  I am of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964"">Michael Pollan</a> camp that says if you want to eat something unhealthy, then make it yourself.  It will taste better, and be packed with actual ingredients instead of chemical filler.<br /><br />And yes, these ""Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond"" are unhealthy, no matter that they are qualified with ""a wholesome way to satisfy your sweet tooth.""  There may be 10 grams of whole grains per serving, but look closely at that ingredients list and you will find a whole bunch of things that mother nature never intended to be used as food.  Each cookie carries a pretty hefty calorie count as well, so this isn't a carefree snack.<br /><br />They taste ... OK.  They have that same chemical aftertaste of most packaged cookies, and for a soft cookie they are somewhat dry and flavorless.  There are chocolate chunks and almonds,  which is a nice addition, but doesn't make up for the chemical flavor and dryness.<br /><br />For me, I will just stick with homemade.  Oatmeal cookies are easy and fun to make, and taste 100% better than these packaged ones.  Quaker Oats has some good ideas, and I think I will toss some almonds and real chocolate chips into my next batch of cookies, but I won't be buying these again."
33356,B007JFMH96,A3QE6W49BZY8YJ,7/10/12,3,4,2,Not so tasty,"These cookies have a very industrial, almost cardboard taste. Really nothing like any oatmeal cookies I have ever had. Somehow they managed to put almonds and chocolate in there without their flavors being detectable. What gives? The only plus is that you get 4 grams of fiber out of each cookie."
33358,B007JFMH96,A3EZHMGGWY74HY,7/31/12,2,3,2,Gritty and dry cookies,"I usually love Quaker products, but lately the two items I've tried have disappointed me.  These cookies are SO dry, the nuts and chocolate are so tiny, you can't even see them, and the texture is simply dreadful.  I doubt I'll get anyone in my family to finish this box, I'll probably bring them to my brother, he'll eat anything!<br /><br />As far as packaging goes, I love the individual wrapped style.  They would certainly keep them fresher than other sorts of packaging I've seen with cookies, but again, these just aren't worth the trouble.  Get yourself some Chunky Chips Ahoy if you are looking for a cookie.  If you want health food, buy some apples!  I hate when companies try to make a healthier cookie.  If people wanted health food, they wouldn't buy a cookie!"
33359,B007JFMH96,A1NN8Q1DLAYPGH,7/28/12,2,3,2,Soft but very dry and practically tasteless.,"If you are expecting Grandma's soft and deliciously moist cookies, you will be seriously disappointed. 6 small cookies come in the package. Out of the six, two did not have even ONE chocolate chip on them. For size and content, please take a look at the pictures I have uploaded.<br /> The flavor leaves a lot to be desired. While they are soft, they are very dry if that makes sense. You feel the need to drink a LOT of milk or water with them. Out of our family of four, two of us thought they were horrible tasting and two thought they were okay. Price wise - just not worth it."
33360,B007JFMH96,A2F09EWKV3MTO2,7/25/12,2,3,2,Not worth buying,"I didn't find these to be particularly good. I don't expect them to be the same quality as homemade but these were not even good for a store bought cookie. As other reviewers mentioned, they are very dry and bland.<br /><br />The quote on the back that says ""Try one, you won't believe it's that good!"" is kind of laughable.<br /><br />I also thought it odd that they come individually wrapped packages of *one* cookie each. You'd think if they were going to be individually wrapped they would come with at least two. Seems like a lot of packaging waste and expense for cookies that aren't even that good. I could get better cookies from the grocery store bakery."
33368,B007JFMH96,A2NNH35DIY658,8/30/12,0,0,2,Sadly Disappointing,"These were just not good cookies. They were dry and bland and certainly not worth the calories. They are high in fiber but they're not a healthy cookie, per se. There just was nothing to recommend these cookies."
33369,B007JFMH96,A3NO9NOCWLFAAJ,8/25/12,0,0,2,Not so great!,I was disappointed in these cookies. They are expensive and I should not have looked at the nutrition label . I guess we tend to associate Quaker Oats with  good nutrition can't say that about these cookies!  One cookies is 1.48 ounces has 180 calories and  8 grams of fat . If I am going ot put that many calories in my  mouth it had better be worth it and these cookies are not worth it! The only good thing nutrition wise is they have 4 grams  of fiber. They do not have much of a flavor/taste either! I would not buy them.
33370,B007JFMH96,A2HIL1IWWD2WEA,8/22/12,0,0,2,Dissapointed,"I thought this cookie was extremely dry. It needed two gulps of milk for every bite. And the flavors were too spread out. Even though I appreciate the extra fiber and I don't like my cookies too sweet, this needed to be sweeter."
33372,B007JFMH96,A2XAQOWHRPY98K,8/19/12,0,0,2,The Ultimate Test: Does it Taste Good?,"Okay, taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary when it comes to these cookies. With that disclaimer, I will say that I was looking forward to consuming these cookies because I do not just have a sweet tooth, all of my teeth are sweet--and baked goods are my number one temptation. I had one of these cookies and did not want another, even when I was jonesing for sweets and dying of hunger. I wouldn't even eat a second one of these when there was nothing else available. That's a bad sign. I ended up putting out my box in the break room at work, where they were snatched up (note: if you put out a half-eaten sandwich in that breakroom, someone is sure to eat it, if you get my drift). The cookies were bland, dry and nothing at all like good homemade cookies. If you're going to indulge, don't waste calories on something like this!"
33378,B007JFMH96,A25PYMGLCQKSSG,8/15/12,0,0,2,Blech!,"The good thing about these cookies?  They have a lot of fiber.  The bad thing?  They have a lot of fiber.  As I chewed, all of that fiber made me think that I was eating sawdust.  The first ingredient on the list is whole grain oat flour.  Good.  However, the ingredient list is rather extensive and includes many different types of sugar in the form of sugar: fructose, invert sugar syrup, sugar, honey, corn syrup and brown sugar molasses.  Quite a variety of sugars there!  Which is interesting, since the cookie itself isn't very sweet.  Actually, the sweetness level is just right, in my opinion.<br /><br />The total carbohydrate count for one cookie is 26 grams.  Total fat = 8 grams.  Sugars = 9 grams.  I'm not so sure that this is the healthiest option for a snack.  Probably a better choice than a candy bar since it has fiber, but not something you'd want to snack on if you're on a diet.<br /><br />Bottom line?  The texture is very gritty and the taste is okay (not too sweet).  However, it is not a low calorie, low sugar snack.  If you're dieting, these probably wouldn't be a good choice."

Needless to say from the title of this review, the cookies are dry, bland and taste nothing like the oatmeal cookies I can make at home with Quaker Oats, using their recipe.  This cookie crumbles easily and the consistency is akin to drywall.  No thanks!"
33385,B007JFMH96,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,8/12/12,0,0,2,Not something I'd get with my own money,"I'd selected this without seeing that it had almonds in it (reading fail, I know) but I had a house full of critics to run this through.<br /><br />My mother ripped into the box before I even had a chance to ask her if she wanted one. She was actually somewhat disappointed, as this was exactly the type of thing she likes. She said that they're good, but that they're sort of mediocre as far as cookies go. My grandparents liked the cookies and would eat them, but it was clear that it was only because they're there.<br /><br />I do have an allergic reaction to tree nuts, but for the sake of the review I tried a tiny piece. (Don't worry, I took precautions and I felt I owed it to at least try the cookie myself..) It's pretty bland and while it smells really great and is very soft, those two things just didn't translate into a huge flavor situation.<br /><br />The general consensus was that while these were decent enough to eat, they're really not something anyone is overwhelmed by. The box has sat in the kitchen pantry for almost a month now and there's still half a box left, if that says anything to you. This is just a mediocre cookie. If my family had liked these then I'd have gladly bought some for them again (I love feeding them), but their reaction was so ambivalent that I don't think I'd get these on my own."
33387,B007JFMH96,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,8/9/12,0,0,2,Not good,"I received Quaker Soft baked Oatmeal cookie, chocolate almond box by post. What I saw after receiving it baffled me. Even though each of the cookie has been individually wrapped, the cookies are not fresh enough when you open them. They lack the crispness. Due to this the flavor of the product is lost. I did not relish this cookie as much as I would have loved it to be."
33391,B007JFMH96,A301B6L3TCD7WL,8/3/12,0,0,2,Too Soft And Not that Tasty,"Is there such thing as a too soft cookie? Yes, yes there is. I am amazed these cookies managed to get shipped to my place without falling apart in the wrapper. They crumble pretty badly when you take them out. In terms of texture, there is something just off about them. They are soft cookies but do not mistake that description as chewy. In fairness, quaker doesn't really call them chewy anyway, but I think some people will expect that they are. Sweetness is... okay, but it feels lacking in a cookie. Yes, I realize these are supposed to be wholesome, but the problem is there are better tasting soft cookies out there that are natural, organic and wholesome. Kashi has better line of cookies that I love. I am not saying that because I am on a health food kick or need to throw out brands that claim to be green and ""whole"". I still like a Grandma cookie now and then, and Sandies and Grasshoppers. These cookies are... just not satisfying.  If you don't like chewy, Kashi or other name brand cookies, maybe these would be for you because texturally and taste wise they are different.<br /><br /> Just a warning, if you hand these to children, expect to pick up crumbs wherever they go."
33394,B007JFMH96,A1QGDMR4XJOA6N,8/2/12,0,0,2,Suprisingly Not-so-Good,"I'm usually a pretty big fan of Quaker products and I was certainly tempted by the picture on the box.  It's great that whole-grain oat flour is used to make these cookies, and it's also great that each cookie comes with 4 grams of dietary fiber which is about 16% of what we each need in an ideal day.  The taste however, is merely OK and that's putting a good spin on it.  I was glad to see that each cookie is individually wrapped and when I unwrapped my first cookie, it certainly seemed moist and inviting.  But when I bit into it, my anticipation turned to disapointment. The fiber must come from sawdust because that was my first thought.  The flavor was mediocre at best, not very strong and not, unfortunately, enough to overcome the fibrous texture.  I wish I could taste some of the almond flavor and a bit more chocolaty goodness instead of the bland nature of the oat flour.<br /><br />So if you're looking for healthy snacks, there are better alternatives out there that offer all of the fiber, etc. but without the 180 calories per cookie.  And if you're looking for a good tasting cookie, well, then I'd avoid this product all together."
33395,B007JFMH96,AXR3CV6A4FMBG,8/2/12,0,0,2,I'll Find My Calories Somewhere Else,"These cookies were unanimously disliked by the six people in the office with whom I shared. We all found them to be dry and tasteless with an unappetizing texture. No one even finished an entire cookie. Plus, there are only six cookies, each individually wrapped, in a box that's way too large. That really irks the tree hugger in me. Definitely a disappointment and not recommended."

Yeesh. I was expecting something like an ""Archway"" cookie from the mid-70s -- soft cookies you'd put in a lunchbox. I'm unclear what the story is with these cookies, but they're just not very good.

I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce.  In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either.  Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.<br /><br />If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself.

It smells great when you first puncture the k-cup, but then it's all down hill from there.  It's fruity, no nuttiness at all, with a strange aftertaste, and kind of weak on a 6oz brew.  It works fine with a cocoa for a mocha, but not good at all by itself.  This is coming from someone who likes the ""Dark Magic"" and ""Double Black Diamond"" k-cups."

The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first."

Also, the seasoning is slightly higher than mild for US tastes, although if you like Texas chili, you might like it. I think this is true for the Spinach Paneer, both of which I sampled right away on arrival.<br /><br />As a precaution, don't open the packet near an open flame. All the packets I have tested spurt a mix of oil and butter when opened, maybe a teaspoon or so in all, maybe a fire hazard, but also a bugle call for any household Florida cockroaches to come running (and be dealt with).<br /><br />If you want to blunt the spiciness, I recommend adding a tablespoon of protein powder and mixing in after heating. That also brings down the calories to protein ratio.<br /><br />OK, heat it in an Amazon stoneware saucepan-pfaendl using a multi-size Amazon lid to keep it from splattering. Pour it out over genuine Amazon kasha, with maybe some Amazon iodized table salt to taste, and the kasha justifies the butter somewhat.

Really the only upside is that one of these just takes a couple minutes in the microwave to heat up, so if you need to eat RIGHT NOW and you don't much care what you eat, this could theoretically work. Though, if you absolutely must have curry in a pouch, I can think of at least one well-known private-label grocery store brand that is far better for roughly the same price if not cheaper.

I got the baby white, the baby yellow, and the ladyfinger. Using 1/2 cup of corn and 2 tablespoons of oil in the whirley, both the ladyfinger and the baby yellow would pop up fluffy enough to fill the entire whirley. The white consistently only fills about halfway...it just doesn't taste as light and crisp either.  Recommend going for the ladyfinger (tastes the best and the least hulls by far, but it's so tiny it's almost hard to eat without dropping a lot) or yellow if you're trying this brand.

The first time I easily pulled it out of her throat but today it almost killed her. I should have known better because I'd been told as much by many people at my vets (one dog even choked to death) but the reviews online were so good I didn't listen. I always watch my dog with chews but even under supervision she will try and swallow them ASAP. These are great for your dogs teeth but please watch your dog!<br /><br />Also, the sizes are very inconsistent... in the four bags I've ordered to date I've had to throw a large number out (basically one full bags worth) because they are too small to even attempt to give to my dog."

I have a 13 pound Chug (pug chihuahua mix) and I buy the large then cut them into 2 or 3 long pieces. At first I gave her the Enzymatic chew which lasted her a whole day or even two which is good because she usually goes threw chew treats within an hour. Then I gave her the HEXtra chew to try and she loves this one. Most of the pieces are thinner but still last a good day of chewing. I cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. I find that most of the chews for the HEXtra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. For the Enzymatic half the time I have to use a knife to cut it. After she had a taste of the HEXtra she slowly steers away from the Enzymatic each time we give her one. After 2 weeks whenever we give her the Enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. For the HEXtra she still goes crazy over them! She goes through all the tricks I taught her without saying the commands lol. I dont know what the big health difference between the HEXtra and Enzymatic but if I had to recommend one I would suggest getting the HEXtra. Hands down your dog will love it. Now im stuck with a big bag of CET Enzymatic that my dog no longer likes because she prefers the HEXtra. Like anyone has mention well with any kind of chew treats remember to take it away when it gets small or it can be a chocking hazard.

They love them and I think they are good for their teeth and to occupy them when they can't be outside running and playing.  But after a few of these treats, one of my German Shepherds started choking on it, and I had to pull it out of the back of her throat.  She wanted it back because she loves them so much, but it made me too nervous. I took them away from the other two immediately, even they were having no problem.  I wish they would come up with a chew that was safer.  I never give my dogs a chew unless I am right with them, but being there doesn't mean I would always be able to dislodge the piece that could potentially kill them.  Not worth it!"

My 3 year old Shihtzu has been taking Greenies and since it costs significantly higher, I thought I can replace it with C.E.T. But sadly, he won't eat it at all. He simply sniffed at it and then walked away. I've tried in several occasions and I am now giving up and am giving it to neighbor's dog. I do have to note that my dog is a very picky eater. Hence my suggestion: If yours is also a picker on food, then try to get a sample or buy a smaller pack first before getting a large bag like I did."

Every bad I have bought has at least 3 and often 6-7 chews that are about 3 times the thickness of the rest.  Anytime my dog has had one of the thicker ones, she has always vomited it up several hours later.  I contacted the co about this, and they said they're aware of this problem, and are changing the supplier.  I have continued to buy them and throwing away the thick ones, 10-30% of the bag over a period of several months, and the problem continues.  They are too expensive to throw so many away.  I don't understand why they don't correct this.  This would be a good product if this problem didn't continue."

You can drop your pasta or dip your bread in an used ash tray if you want to get an idea of the flavor this product provides.  Which is too bad, because the concept of pesto in a tube is great.  It gets bumped from 1 star to 2 for the concept alone.<br /><br />The formula needs serious work, if not a complete overhaul."

Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the ""My K cup"" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang."

I did not like this one at all--I guess it just depends on your taste.  I could tell by the burnt unappealing aroma of it that I wouldn't like it.  It tasted bitter to me with a little bit of a bite to it.  This one's for you if you like a more bitter/bittersweet coffee--it just didn't appeal to me because I like a smoother taste with less of an aftertaste."

It is still stronger than I like.  I have to use much creamer and sugar, plus run more water through a second time.  Not what i hoped for.  Sorry.<br /><br />Would like a truly mild tasting coffee, there were some in the first sample box I bought, but the next two sample boxes had too many strong coffees and many tea cups.  I already have a good selection of tea, etc and only wanted coffee samples.  Am not sure how to find a coffee to my taste without a lot of waste."

It had a sort of stale taste, like coffee that has been sitting in a pot for hours.  I like fairly strong coffee. Coffee People Donut Shop for example.  But this doesn't come close.  It's not weak, just stale.  And no, it wasn't even close to the expiration date."

I hate to be the lone dissenter, but I didn't like this coffee at all; in fact, it was the first of the four samples I've tried so far that I did not like.  To me, it tasted like over-brewed coffee--i.e., like coffee that has been sitting in the pot for several hours.  It wasn't bitter, exactly, but it just did not have a particularly appealing flavor.  I definitely would not buy this coffee again, and I would not recommend it."

There was plenty of flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming like some brands are.  It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance.  I ordered the Habanero flavor next.  I was extremely disappointed.  Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.  If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips.  THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor."

I usually order my favorite brand, but decided to try Celestial Seasoning when the other was out of stock on Amazon. I was surprised to find that this blend does not taste like Earl Grey at all. While other brands vary as well, to me, this one strays so far as not to be recognizable as Earl Grey. Of course many may like it nevertheless."

This is my second mix after Carbon's Golden Malted Flour. The latter requires more prep time and is more bland, but turns out with a perfect fluffy consistency on the inside with a light crust on the outside. I like the blandness too since it gives a blank slate to work with when adding nuts, blueberries, bananas, etc. I wanted to try this Heartland Mix for mornings when we have less time to work with, and because I love chocolate (who doesn't?!).<br /><br />I really liked the smooth texture that the waffles turned out with. They looked more professional than the Carbon mix which had a slightly mottled surface. The taste was pretty good too. But the waffles themselves were very rubbery and you had to work harder to chew them. I did let the mix rest for 20 minutes so I doubt that's the issue. Maybe I got a bad mix? Maybe I needed to wait a little longer? I'm not sure. I will revise this rating if I find out I missed something. As it is, the consistency is not going to work for us.<br /><br />I found that I could salvage the mix by adding 1 part to every 3 parts of Carbon's."

This food gave my puppy the worst diarrhea. It is hard enough to potty train her as it is and then I had to deal with her not being able to control her #2. I do care about what goes into my pets because they are like family so I wish that this food did not cause the gastro  problems. So I started feeding her a brand that people dismiss as inferior (Science Diet). I have two other pets who have eaten Science Diet since I got them and they are 16 and 12 years old. So they must be doing something right.

You have to drink a glass of water for every piece of jerky you eat.  It's also a littler drier and less tender than other beef jerky.  I would recommend trying other brands of beef jerky and staying away from this unless you want to develop early high blood pressure."
34933,B002DLXXHG,A16S6CLPWVIWDS,11/8/09,0,0,2,Had better,Some of the jerkey is chewey and hard to eat. I am a big fan of jack links beef jerkey. I wouldnt buy again because so many pieces are hard to eat being chewy or vainy. Ah well have 3 more packs to give a try. The price was good but still I personally couldn't eat 1 out of 3 pieces. Could be just spoiled with others i guess.
34934,B002DLXXHG,A6B3PDKSC9DF2,11/1/09,0,0,2,"Good price, OK quality","This jerky tastes okay, but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat.  I don't know if I got a bad batch, but all the jerky I ate had hard veins running through them. All in all, I would give 2.5 stars, but since I can't, and I don't like rounding up, I have to go with 2.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The Jerky is tender, but not overly tender.  It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.  I'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the US.<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />The flavor was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  There are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor."
34938,B002DLXXHG,A1G9RXN4S5D9WO,8/20/09,0,0,2,Decent at best,"This Jerky is close, but not quite as good as good as other pre-packaged bags you can get at the gas station.  It's tender and substantial, so points there.  The flavor though is mediocre at best; poor would be a fair description.<br /><br />Also, if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days.  Maybe this is a problem with other brands of jerky too.  I wouldn't know because this is the first time I have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly (see above's flavor comments).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't very good jerky."

THE NEW PURCHASE OF SEVERAL BAGS (ATE TWO SO FAR) HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING. FLAVOR PROFILE HAS CHANGED AND PRODUCT IS TOUGH AND DRY. GOING TO LOOK FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT BRAND. TOO BAD. PROBABLY GOT TOOK FOR A WILD RIDE (CRASHING) WITH THIS PURCHASE.
34974,B002DLXXHG,A1TRLVHP63H1KQ,5/3/11,0,1,2,Inconsistent,"I've tried all the flavors at least once.  Original and Teriyaki multiple times.  First batch of Original and Teriyaki was great, 2nd and 3rd batches too over-flavored.  Pepper was too peppery (and I love pepper).  Hickory was too strong/salty.  Just not consistent.  Not going to waste more money on this product."
34976,B002DLXXHG,A25W8OXAD3CUUS,4/29/10,0,1,2,"Tender as promised, but more salt and gristle than bargained for","By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else."

34978,B002DLXXHG,A119G2JCEJLWA3,3/24/10,0,1,2,Unremarkable jerky-dog treat,"I got a couple bags of Wild Ride Original and I now cannot believe the 5-star reviews. The positive is that it is moist and not dry, which is what I like, but I had to throw out at least half the package because so many pieces were unchewable. It was worth a try, but a mistake I won't make again."

It arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and it tastes good.  But, it's not ""all-natural with no chemical preservatives"" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?  Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities."

While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself."

I didn't enjoy the texture of the outside part of the cake nor was there much difference in the taste between the fillings, an exception was the matcha. I have spent a good portion of my life eating Asian deserts particularly living near Chinatown in New York City. I understand that this is a Japanese assortment, but I believe the fillings lacked flavor, in particular the red bean. I adore red bean, chestnut and taro (taro wasn't included in the assortment but just saying), and so while the product was fresh and delivered on time. The quality wasn't there."

I ordered on the 15th, and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2-day shipping. My case was supposedly the restocked pears, but the expiration date is Nov 09.

The slightest touch makes them slide.<br /><br />The remaining problem is that the third game -- the one in which the covers have to be lifted -- requires the dog to do nothing more than what a dog does naturally:  pick up something with its mouth.  No biggie.<br /><br />I can see how this toy would be valuable to an extremely old, arthritic dog, who would appreciate the minimal effort needed to attain a treat.  Other than that, I think it is a waste of money.  An average dog would be unchallenged and a smart dog would be positively bored."

Certainly not a brain teaser.  Because there are small pieces the owner must be involved in the game to be sure a puppy doesn't eat them.  My dog much prefers the ball with treats inside that fall out as he noses it around and so do I as it keeps him independently amused for at least 15 minutes.

Chicken soup never did me any harm, I guess -- but I can't remember it curing anything, either.  Though not my favourite soup, I never really disliked it.  OK....<br /><br />My mother makes a clear soup.  Soak the chicken, and vegetables, under a low light, in a covered pot, for hours.  Then, take the fat off with a ladel.  Remove the chicken and vegetables, and serve on a separate platter, (so that just the right amount of chicken stock and vegetables go into each person's soup...or none at all, if desired.)<br />Not bad!<br /><br />My own way of making chicken soup is a little simpler.  Take chicken meat, (breat, dark meat from the legs, whatever you wish), and cut into small pieces, (the smaller, the better.)

Also not bad.<br /><br />However, CAMPELL'S HEALTHY REQUEST CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP, which I bought to save refrigerator space, (chicken parts have to be refrigerated, this soup does not) -- doesn't taste good, (OR like either my mom's chicken soup, or my own).  I suppose this is because ""modified food starch"", (the second ingredient in this Campbell's soup), was never used by either my mother or myself in OUR<br />chicken soups.  (Has ANYONE ever added modified food starch to their home-made chicken soups, I wonder?).  Yes, there are tiny bits of chicken meat in this soup, (fourth ingredient, after chicken stock, modeified food starch, and water)...but very little of these.  Most ofthe ingredients come under the heading: Less than 2% of"", but I begin to wonder if the ""chicken meat"" contained in the first section of ingredients, (those above 2%), may be like only 3% or so!  In the ""2% or less"" category are listed both ""salt"" and ""sea salt""....making for perhaps 4% salt, in toto.  This is supposed to be a ""low-sodium"" soup -- but is 410 mgs of salt, (17% of Daily Value), actually a ""low sodium"" soup?  Pehaps, compared to the regular Campbell's soup, (listed at 840 mgs on the label), it is.  But NO-ONE I ever knew puts even 410 mgs of salt into any home-made soup.  A preservative?  Yes.  But still too much salt for my taste.  VITAMIN E is also a preservative -- and a much healthier one at that.  More expensive -- definiely yes.  But it would make the soup far more palatable to have 1/2 the salt, (205 mgs), and then adding a little Vitamin E!  All I know is that this abundance of salt adds not only somewhat of a danger to my heart, but also a slightly sour taste to this soup.  Making it taste, not only sour, but also so very, very UNLIKE the chicken soup I either my mom or I make.<br /><br />Perhaps the regular, Non-Healthy Request Chicken Soup by Campbell's is better.  I'll get one or two cans from my local supermarket and see, before I buy 24 via Amazon, (which is what I should have done, before buying this ""Healthy Request"" Campbell's soup.)  Truly, I like their Heathy Request Mushroom and Celery Soups, and don't find their Healthy Request Tomato Soup half-bad.  But one can't judge every Campbell's soup by the ones that one likes, it seems.  This cicken soup is just too salty and too soury for me ever to buy it again.  But it is palatable...JUST palatable. So, yes, I will force myself to finish all twenty-four 10 and 3/4 ounce cans....maybe one every three days or so.<br />Chicken soup is, after all, supposed to be good for one.  Or so they say.<br /><br />I'm sure this isn't BAD soup.  I just wish it tasted better."

Having ordered less expensive arrangements from this vendor in the past, I find their decision to offer a lesser product (and with no offer of a refund for the downgrade) inexcusable. I do not recommend this vendor, and will not use them in the future. Their quality control (not to mention customer service) is obviously slipping; I recommend you take your business elsewhere."

The praise in other reviews, especially for the hickory strips, convinced me to try them. I now suspect the praise was ""planted"" by vested interests.<br /><br />The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee."

As soon as I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was that the jerky is very moist, not like real beef jerky at all (which I understand to be dry and chewy). Also, it smelled like pure dog food. I decided to take a bite anyway, and found that it tastes exactly like it smells. All I could think about was that I was eating dog food. I gave it 2/5 stars because one of my friends actually liked it, and apparently so do a lot of Amazon users since it comes highly recommended.

Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like these, they didn't taste like food - hard to describe, but the 'primal' branding doesn't help as I did feel like I was eating something I wasn't supposed to.<br /><br />While the first one I tried was novel, I easily tired of them and then plain got grossed out by them. I won't be getting these again."
35857,B000LKXJEI,ASEGKEBLODKZE,5/28/09,10,13,2,Tasty but with a big drawback,"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer)."

I did like the fact that it has a meaty texture, but not a hard leather texture that I tend to avoid in jerky. It was hard enough so that I had to floss my teeth to avoid irritation to my gums, but that's true with all meat. Besides texture, it also tasted like meat. However, it also tasted like someone was trying to make a BBQ flavored candy bar. Way too sweet, and just an overall bad taste. My dog goes nuts for them though, so they're not completely wasted."

For that reason I can't imagine it performing well as a pizza crust.  As a flatbread, it's fine.  Regardless of how much liquid I put in the dough, the edges dry easily, like a cracker, but the middle in some cases was still doughy.  So, if you just want a tasty gluten-free treat, it's great.  But it doesn't perform as its intended."

I was hoping to use it to flavor ice creams and yogurts, but it does not have enough violet flavor to work in this way.  I've tried just adding more of it to increase the flavor, but then the sweet taste becomes too strong.  If you are looking for a sweetener with a hint of flavor, this will be great for you, but if you are trying to make violet flavored treats such as are available in Europe, you will be disappointed with this syrup."

If you haven't previously eaten European cookies, you may no like these.  I have to also admit that after I made the purchase, I started to look at some of the previous reviews and I was appalled at how much calories and fat these cookies have.  Granted, they're cookies for Heaven sakes (not health food), but don't be fooled into thinking that since you may find them a bit bland that they probably have less of the ""bad stuff"" in them.......Not so!<br /><br />Long and the short, if you've never tried these cookies before, I would strongly recommend that you sample a sleeve (if you can find them) in your grocery store so you don't get stuck with a case that may not be eaten if your family doesn't like them."

While hoping that they would have replaced the ""bad fat"" with a poly or mono unsaturated fat they have chosen to go with palm and coconut oil, two of the  nutritionally worst ""vegetable oils"", to make matters worse they fully hydrogenate these oils making the ratio of fat that is found in the cookies 86% saturated (6gm/7gm)!<br /><br />Nutritionally one could do better by picking almost any other cookie - so I'd recommend skipping this one."

Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"

The first thought that came to mind as it hit my palate was sea water.  Salty!  Then lemony sourness followed.  Not a sugary taste that I was expecting.  No this does not taste sweet at all and had the sourness approaching that of a lemon.<br /><br />It has a strange but interesting aroma that is not at all bad.  In fact I felt drawn to smell several more times trying to put a name on the unexpected yet familiar complex aroma.  It reminds me  of a bologna sandwich on white bread with overpowering hints of celery.<br /><br />If you are not used to this kind of drink, I will say that it is probably much more of an acquired taste.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />&#350;algam is a popular beverage from southern Turkey's cities of Adana and Mersin. Although the Turkish word &#351;algam literally means ""turnip,"" &#351;algam is actually made with the juice of red carrot pickles, salted, spiced, and flavoured with aromatic turnip (elem) fermented in barrels with the addition of ground bulgur. It is traditionally served cold in large glasses with long slices of pickled carrots, called tane (or in some accents, dene.) Hot paprika relish is added just before drinking. Hot or regular, it is a popular drink with Adana kebab.<br />&#350;algam is often served with rak&#305; (alcoholic beverage)--not mixed, but rather in a separate glass. While &#350;algam is commonly used to cure hangovers, consuming excess amounts may cause bloating."

I read good reviews and bad reviews..but I still wanted to try on my own. I opened the bag and just like the reviews it did have a fish smell...the smell wasn't as bad as I would've imagined..it's tolerable not as bad as a smell of after taking a dump. I washed them with cold water for about a minute..the smell was there a bit. Boiled them in hot water for around 5 minutes and the smell was kinda gone. So I put them in my already cooked meat sauce. Let it cook up for around 5 minutes. I tried just one little noodle...goodness..let's just say I didn't want to try again. The taste well it DOESN'T taste bad. The TEXTURE!!!!!! that's where the problem is....it just felt like I was eating a raw worm!..no I've never eaten a worm..but you know how soft warms are and imagine eating it and you feel that soft crunchiness...that's what I felt while eating it. I definitely wouldn't be able to eat the whole pack. Some reviewers said it was like rubber band....well...at least rubber band has a more harder texture. A worm is the closest thing of a texture I can tell you.<br />Do I recommend this: Of course not haha good luck. I bought mine at iherb (2 packs) for &lt;$4 so I feel sorry for those who bought 6 packs and had to throw them away.

I knew they wouldn't be starchy like real pasta noodles.  I prepared myself for the smell, thinking that carb-free pasta is worth any smell that washes off; oddly enough, the packages I got had little or no odor at all.  I followed the directions exactly the first time, then followed a few suggestions from people I know who loves these things in an attempt to make them work for me.  In the end, I just couldn't get past the texture.  I tried making them less firm, more firm, keeping them really hot...nothing worked to get me past that gelatinous, slipperly, worm-iness.  The first bite wasn't too bad, but after a couple more, I completely lost my appetite.  Flavor-wise, these really will just take on the taste of whatever you put on, or in them.  But texture and appearance are big factors for me in food, and these clear, sinewy-textured attempts at noodliness were just not appetizing for me."

They are firm enough to have more texture than pasta, but still gel like. I just put them with spaghetti sauce, but maybe there's a better option. Have not found it yet. I've read more about them and what nutritional benefits they may have so it makes it worth the try. Cost is certainly reasonable enough. Give them a try and maybe you'll have a better idea."

Though not naive' enough to believe they would quite resemble traditional pasta,  the reviews led me to believe they would more palatable  They arrive  ""precooked"", packaged  in watery solution and all you have to do is snip the bag, rinse thoroughly and blanch in boiling water for one minute.  Here's where I went wrong: Knowing in advance they had a reputation for smelling foul, I should NEVER have personally verified this. Think decaying roadside animal carcass.  It's really that bad. Once I smelled them, they hardly had a chance. I rinsed them for 2 minutes or more and then blanched as directed, and doused them with a Thai peanut dressing. While they take on the flavor of their  accompanying sauce/seasoning, that's where the encouraging news ends. Zero Calorie Noodles  chew like rubber bands and leave you generally disappointed. If you like chewy Asian glass noodles, maybe, just maybe these will satisfy. The idea sounds good, but reality is a foul smelling, chewy crunch that is not worth the non-nutritive effort."

My problem was with the taste, i love korean food and fish but just could not get past the fish smell(strangly no fish taste whatsoever). i rinsed the noodles and re rinsed them my entire kitchen reeked of old fish, and the texture of the noodles was very strange to say the least."

Unfortunately half of the packs were all shriveled up and were super thin, almost crunchy, they weren't absorbing the moisture. My husband and I tried to eat them anyway, but they were so bad we had to throw them away. For how expensive they are I feel very ripped off!!!! If it wasn't for the bad ones I would already be ordering more, too bad :("

It is incredibly expensive, there aren't that many noodles, and I did NOT feel full from this.  The noodles do smell once you take them out of the package; however, they cook up rather easily.  They will stick together - so when you take them out of the water and put them on paper towels, make sure that you lay them out - otherwise, you will have issues later.  They do NOT have a taste, so make sure that you stir fry them or let them simmer with whatever you are using them with, otherwise, you will be disappointed.  Sorry, but I won't buy them again - too much money."

Therefore I did not have a good idea of how to prepare on use these noodles.  Upon delivery since it as a hot day and the noodles are packed in water, they were very hot, not sure if that makes a difference but I would feel better if these were package differently."
36557,B004CLCEDE,A2J6YP7YKAX4W0,9/18/12,1,2,2,"Different, not unpleasent, but not a treat either","I bought these because I'm a sucker for low calorie carbs. I just loves my rice, noodles, pasta, etc.and thought these would be a great substitute.  These are a no calorie substitute, but like substituting tofu for meat, the taste is in the myriad of ingredients you cook them with. They have no taste on their own and a rather obnoxiously slimy texture. The fishy smell you get when you open a package quickly dissipates with rinsing in cold water, they firm up a little with a quick parboil, but on their own they are BLAH. I have stir fried them and boiled them for soup with veggies, garlic, sauces, you name it. They aren't worth the effort. I will continue to stir fry and boil veggies, but I probably won't bother with these ""noodles"" again. A Tofurkey will never be a turkey and these will never satisfy a noodle craving."

However, I just cannot get over the texture.  I kept feeling like I was eating hookworms since they were long, clear and rubbery. *shudder*  Won't be able to eat the other bags."
36628,B004CLCEDE,A3URUBE7ATWIM0,7/16/11,0,4,2,Caveat,"I must say up front I have not tried these noodles.  I ordered them and, when they arrived, I opened the box to find bags of white, squigly things suspended in a clear fluid (water).  It looked like something I would order from an elementary science teacher's supply catalog.  So I set it on my counter and spent a week trying to get past the way they look.  I visited the web site again.  I read the -good- reviews.  But the bottom line, for me, is that they look repulsive.  On day 7, they went into the trash.  I have a similar issue with Barilla Plus.  I think they taste fine, but they look very unappetizing to me after they are cooked.  If you are trying to find a good noodle (pasta) alternative, try Dreamfields.  It's real pasta; it tastes like real pasta; it looks like pasta; it's good quality pasta. But it has a higher fiber content, which makes it more filling and lowers the glycemic index.  You'll never know you're not eating regular old pasta."

I prepped it as per the instructions.  I rinsed it longer than necessary, boiled it for a minute and then decided to pan fry it for good measure.  I made an alfredo sauce for it and tossed some in while in the pan since it's supposed to absorb flavors.  My husband took one bite and said no way.  He couldn't get past the texture.  I mixed it with the sauce and some grilled chicken, but had to stop eating it.  It made me gag after a while.  I tried so hard to like it, but just couldn't.  I'll wait a few weeks 'till I can have the low carb pasta.  This is totally not worth it.  Sadly, I ordered it from the Miracle Noodle site so I have several bags left.  I may try again, but most likely they will end up in the trash."

I have no idea if this was a shipping malfunction (the box wasn't THAT damaged) or if this is why the cans are so well priced?  Now I'm wondering if they're also expired?  If there is an expiration date on the can, it is encoded, so I won't be able to tell if this is just cosmetic damage or not safe to use?"
36748,B001HTJ2BQ,A2AIIERWCRRQK8,9/8/11,31,31,2,Supply Shortage so Product Coming From Sri Lanka not Thailand,"I love their product from Thailand.  I don't like the product from Sri Lanka.<br />The content of coconut oil is higher in Sri Lanka made coco milk, throwing off the consistency.<br />I don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie,<br />it will just chunk up anyway.  Wrote the manufacturer - here's the reply<br /><br />From the manufacturer:<br />Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconut<br />milk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer in<br />Thailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore we<br />have added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as our<br />secondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly different<br />processing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product has<br />more tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degrees<br />F. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separates<br />from the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied by<br />placing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and then<br />stirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience,<br />especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother,<br />creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. While<br />all natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cool<br />temperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Faced<br />with lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconut<br />season, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistencies<br />from two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at all<br />during this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourced<br />coconut milk<br />as of right now, but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankan<br />sourced product.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience and your understanding.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Joanna Freet<br />Edward & Sons Trading Co., Inc."
36758,B001HTJ2BQ,A3JVBEITQELXSH,6/25/11,9,9,2,Quality changed!,I've had a total of 4 shipments of this product.  2 shipments had quality fat and taste.  Thick nutritious fat clinging to the can. I had to put the product in the blender to blend it. I was impressed as this is how it should be. 2 shipments had poor quality. Very thin watery cans of product.  I even put the product in the refrigerator and it didn't thicken one little bit. That is unacceptable.  I have been debating on allowing another shipment to come with the hopes of getting a good batch or cancel my subscribe and save order for this product. I have decided to cancel and make my own coconut milk.
36761,B001HTJ2BQ,A4SVJLZZ830HU,5/24/12,6,6,2,Thin product from Sri Lanka,"After reading reviews from 8-12+ months prior to my purchase complaining about how inferior the milk from Sri Lanka was, I felt confident that Amazon would stop stocking that product and ordered a case. It was from Sri Lanka. It is a thin product that becomes greasy when heated. It lacks the thick rich taste I'm used to from Native Forest. Very disappointed. I only gave it a 2 star because of the BPA free can. I'd like to rate Amazon a zero for not listening to us complain."
36769,B001HTJ2BQ,A2EOPHD73XBSDI,8/31/11,4,4,2,"Like everybody else said, dented cans and poor product","I previously purchased this product at Whole Foods.  The coconut milk was delicious and had a nice head of custard when it was left to sit for awhile.  I did not take notice of the country of origin of the previously purchased product, but the one I received from Amazon was from Sri Lanka.  I have to echo everybody else's review that the product was of poor quality.  There was no head of custard, half the cans were dented and battered and the product was thin and not as good tasting.  I am going to find another brand, because this product is now clearly inferior."
36772,B001HTJ2BQ,A2XT9WMMQRGUQ6,6/7/12,3,3,2,"Used to be better, now is just guar gum","We experienced the country shift that Native Forest went through last year. Since they are one of the few, if only, companies offering BPA-free coconut milk, we stuck with it, but the quality of the product is pretty poor now. It was actually BETTER when it would separate because it actually tasted like coconut milk. You just has to heat it in another container to get it to combine (come on - its an organic product - mother nature didn't produce things for long distance shipping in metal cans and THAT'S OK). Now that they've switched countries of origin, it stays more mixed, but it has NO COCONUT TASTE. It is just a can of guar gum. :("
36774,B001HTJ2BQ,ATCP7FC771A6M,9/27/11,3,3,2,Be aware of the changes that have been made!!,"I started buying this product in January and it was thick, creamy and delicious.  I needed a hand blender to mix the thick cream with the milk and enjoyed using it to make puddings, etc.  Then, in the Spring the product changed dramatically for the worse.  As previous reviewers stated, they started sourcing the milk from Sri Lanka instead of Thailand and the end product was thin, watery and had little clumps of fat that would not and could not be blended into the milk.  I called the customer service and they advised me to wait before buying more until the can once again said that it was a product of Thailand.  So, a few weeks ago, I was delighted to see that the cans at my local health food store once again stated that they were a ""product of Thailand"".  However, the product is still not the same product as it was before the change in sourcing.  While it is back to having a creamy like consistency, it is noticeably thinner.  Instead of needing a spoon, it pours right out of the can with the same consistency and thickness of light cream.  I can no longer use it to make puddings, etc because it is too thin.  It's as if someone watered down the product.  I called the company once again and they had absolutely no explanation for this change in thickness.  For a comparison, I also bought a can of the Thai Kitchen brand coconut milk (also sourced from Thailand) and it was exceptionally thick and creamy, about twice the thickness as the Native Forest.  So, until someone can give me a good explanation as to why the new coconut milk is so thin, I will switch to the Thai Kitchen brand.  What a shame, since this used to be a great product."
36775,B001HTJ2BQ,A358LYMJRR1IJW,8/2/11,3,3,2,"Used to be great, Not sure anymore",Same experience as others here<br /><br />Been buying this stuff forever and had an active subscription as well.<br />Last shipment said product of Sri lanka and it's just awful compared to the original version from Thailand<br />The only thing that remained the same was the company name<br />Need to find another brand now<br />Very unhappy about this
36787,B001HTJ2BQ,AC0OKGX438GZ2,7/29/11,2,2,2,"quality has changed, oil separated, not creamy","Have had this brand a year or two ago and it was creamy, delicous, and good.  Then I ordered Rolands organic coconut milk for a great price on Amazon and really enjoyed it as well-- thick, creamy coconut flavor.  When it was time to reorder Rolands I found reviews stated that quality had changed, so I thought I'd return to a brand I trusted.  It seems the quality of many have changed recently, not sure why.<br /><br />In this specific batch, the milk was a bit more watery and oily.  I just use a portion of the can daily in smoothies, so when I refrigerate the remaining milk, the distinct oil separates and forms a hard layer on top.  Whereas, previous coconut milk would behave more like unhomogenized milk, and thick cream would collect on top (not a slab of ""butter"")."
36789,B001HTJ2BQ,A1ZEB03H86WI3F,7/24/11,2,2,2,Quality varies,"For several months now I have been ordering this by the case on subscribe and save.  Compared to other brands, I have noticed that some cans go bad really quickly once opened.  Also, I recently received a case in which at least several of the cans had coconut oil that had separated from the milk. I know that the white and clear parts of the milk often separate, but i have never opened a can of coconut milk and had a layer of oil on top.  Very disappointed.  Was hopeful because the cans are BPA free so I would like to stick with this company, but how can I justify the expense? We have just thrown away so many cans of it because we weren't sure it was good."
36791,B001HTJ2BQ,A3L28U28W3R7YV,7/17/11,2,2,2,Watery and thin,"I purchased two cases of Native Forest Coconut milk and received the Sir Lanka-sourced product.<br /><br />It is thin, with hardly any fat. It's not suitable for cooking with, since it is too watery and does not have the richness of other brands of coconut milk. Thai Kitchen's coconut milk is much thicker and flavorful.<br /><br />The only upside is that I can use it undiluted in a shake, where I normally use 1:2 coconut milk and water. That's how thin it is, straight out of the can."
36812,B001HTJ2BQ,A28R1LSGDILJVP,7/2/11,1,1,2,Inconsistent Quality,"I go through a lot of coconut milk and this is the only brand I'll buy because Native Forest is the only company I know of that uses BPA free cans.  However the product is very inconsistent.  Sometime I get wonderful rich thick coconut milk and other times its watery, curdled, and gritty.  The watery stuff does not do well in my recipes at all.  I saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from Sri Lanka or Thailand.  I will not be ordering these from amazon.  Even though it is more expensive at the store, I want to be able to make sure I'm getting the thick coconut milk.  It's really unacceptable that two completely different products are being sold as the same product."
36818,B001HTJ2BQ,A8AD6PLQ0PPQE,1/10/11,2,3,2,Packaging Problems,"I purchased a case of 12 cans. Out of those 12 cans, only four appear to be undented. EIGHT out of 12 are badly dented. The BOX they are packed in is fine so they had to have been dented when they were packed into the box. This is unacceptable quality control. I gave this 2 stars because of this problem from the seller but I don't know yet what to think of the coconut milk itself as I have not yet opened one of the four seemingly undented cans. Some posters here have said the cans are BPA free but the cans don't look high enough quality to be BPA free. Eden Foods use BPA free cans and their cans LOOK high quality. I hope it is true of the Native Forest coconut milk cans but I'm not sure of that. The number of dented cans in an undamaged box is definitely a big disappointment."

I came back to order and the price nearly doubles!!!  What is with that?  Is there a shortage of coconuts?  Does any one know?
36843,B004LQRQL0,A3OIJYUJZTTOAK,2/21/12,0,0,2,Not all nuts are fresh...,"I bought these organic chocolate covered Brazil nuts based on the good reviews.  The nuts that are fresh are very good.  However, about 1 in five nuts is rancid.  Sometimes Brazil nuts will have an earthy taste.  This is not an earthy taste, it is the taste of old nuts where the oil in the nut is turning rancid.  The expiration date on the package is 10/12 which is 8 months away.  This is a very expensive treat to have 20% of the product bad.  I cannot recommend."

They are crispy which is weird for an apple, and they taste like they were soaked in oil. The flavored ones are way too sweet and even the plain ones have corn syrup, which is really bad for you. They also have a lot of fat and sugar, which is completely stupid since this snack claims to be healthy. I feel bad eating these because they are not healthy at all. I'd rather eat a real apple or some dried fruit."

Wow, was I disappointed. The after taste is awful!! The only time I've been able to use it I had to add something. As an example no sugar added vanilla ice cream, hershey's sf syrup and a bunch of fresh strawberries. You can still taste the after taste but at least it's tolerable that way. If you want chocolate milk or hot chocolate forget it. Look elsewhere!!"

The package comes with two ""morphing"" flavors that are supposed to be cherry to cherry lime and orange to orange strawberry. They have the same plastic-like base texture, but there are tiny crunchy ""flavor changing beads."" I only bit directly down on two, which was enough to really release the flavor. They did not have a fruit smell either, it was similar to play-doh. Out of the entire package, one changed from orange to orange-with-something-funky and one did change from bland cherry to something close to lime zest. I didn't think they were worth the calories (220) to eat one individual package. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing or eating this flavor again."

Even after only eating a single cookie, 15 minutes later I was so thirsty it was uncomfortable. I discovered they have 160 mg sodium per serving (4 cookies in a serving according to the label). Compare that to a health valley organic chocolate chip granola bar at 15mg of sodium per bar, a whole foods brand 365 organic swiss dark chocolate with mint crisps chocolate bar at 0 mg sodium, 365 brand frosted morning O's with 50mg of sodium, and you can easily see how salty these are. Newman O's mint creme flavor have 2 cookies in a serving (which is actually like 4 cookies with a creme center like an oreo, with only 70mg sodium per serving, less than half. The point is, the sodium isn't just bad if you are on a low sodium diet, but they are bad because they make you very thirsty... uncomfortably thirsty! Too bad, because they are delicious. I won't be buying another box with too many other mint chocolate products on the market that are healthier and don't leave me uncomfortable a few minutes later like eating at a restaurant whose food is delicious on the plate but get home and experience stomach pains, acid reflux, or other discomfort. I have learned that there are many restaurants with delicious food and no discomfort after and the food digests well. Food is more than the moment. It has to also nourish and not make you sick later... These don't make the cut. And its not that I'm weird. I'm a normal 30-something guy with a healthy apetite and discerning palette. Buyer beware."

I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried."

I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6."

If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do."

I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first.

I tried to soften them by placing in a jar of olive oil but even after weeks they continue to have a very tough, leathery texture.

Frankly, I cannot think of why anyone would buy these alleged ""health"" bars. Each of these bars are 200 calories, have 7 grams of fat, 10 mg of cholesterol a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrate and only four grams of protein. Also, based upon a 2,000 calorie per day diet they don't provide any Vitamin A, or Vitamin C, 4% of the recommended Calcium, 8% of the Iron, 6% of Thiamin and 10% of Magnesium. At the time of this writing, this Oatmeal Raisin Flavor bar was not yet available for sale but different flavored 12 packs of this same brand of bar sells for around $19. Not only do these bars fall short from a true health standpoint but they're not very good tasting either. They're not terrible but the consumer would definitely want to have it with coffee or tea. As a stand alone bar it's got kind of a chalky texture. There are so many truly healthy and good tasting bars on the market that I don't see this brand becoming a favorite in many households; certainly not in ours.

I emailed them and they confirmed that their product is indeed produced in China. Having traveled in China, and, based on recent problems related to products made in China, I am no longer buying Mrs. Mays. How anyrhinf grown there could be described as ""organic"" strikes me as disingenous at best. The energy required to ship the product back to the US also strikes me as wasteful.

I supposed I could have tried adding strips to soup or something, but I really just wanted something I enjoy eating directly. I don't know if I just got a bad bag, but I don't think I'm going to try another one. Too bad, I loved the idea of the small wrapped portions that would fit in the pocket."

They do not dissolve on the tongue as nicely as competitors' products do. I got through one of the 100 packs in the Amazon shipment but I plan to give the rest away if I can."
37636,B002R81L92,ATVH10TP7BZNL,6/22/12,2,2,2,"Okay, Not Great","This flavored chocolate confection is merely okay.<br /><br />First off, it isn't really chocolate over pomegranate seeds.  That would have been cool.  Instead it is chocolate that supposedly has the flavoring from a different confection from the same manufacturer, and that confection supposedly tastes something like pomegranate.  That stuff is mixed into dark chocolate to make this stuff.<br /><br />The dark chocolate part of this confection isn't semi-sweet, which is what I'm used to seeing for dark chocolate, instead its regular sweet, making it too sweet.<br /><br />Some of the confection appears to have that beige dimpling that occurs when chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, is exposed to the elements.  I don't know if its water, or air that does that, but this package was like that.<br /><br />Many of the small balls were stuck together into large constellations.<br /><br />All in all this confection isn't disgusting, but it hardly deserves the rank it has.  I'd say all in all its pretty 3-star average.<br /><br />EXCEPT, this treat has a fatal flaw: it doesn't taste like pomegranate.  Not even a little bit.  Nope, no trace of pomegranate flavor is perceptible.  It tastes like not-pomegranate.  And that not-pomegranate taste isn't readily identifiable.  I eat fresh pomegranates regularly, and so have an inkling of their flavor, and that pomegranate-flavor isn't contained within this chocolate confection."

It was the chocolate without the inner 'raisin.' The last portion in the bag has been sitting idly on my counter for too long.  If they were any good, they'd be long gone by now."

For one thing, they aren't just pomegranite.  They are an odd concoction of multiple fruit juices.  I taste more cranberry than pomegranite (if you like cranberry juice you will love these).  I gave it two stars because the antioxidents should count for something.  And a serving size is 20 pieces, so if you like them you can enjoy a nice sized treat.  They are also quite plump.  I just don't love the cranberry flavor."
37709,B004PXEZAE,A2DPYV7W1GDTV0,10/21/11,5,5,2,Good taste but not so great packaging......Buy with some reservation,"I have always enjoyed Orville Redenbacher brand popcorns, whether it is SmartPop or Natural or Sweet & Savory type. And with such past experiences, I went ahead and bought this particular popcorn (Pop-Up Bowl Butter Microwave Popcorn), even though this particular product is way more expensive than the bag version.<br /><br />First impression: Packaging looks great and the illustration on the box lures you to try it at once as soon as you look at the box.<br /><br />Cooking: I used my Sharp microwave 1200 W, 1.2 cubic feet of sheer raw cooking power. Even though my microwave has sensor based cooking feature for popcorn and other food items, I set the microwave timer to 2 minutes and 30 seconds, so as to not leave anything to chance. Instructions on the pack are very clear about up & down side markings, cooking time, handling instructions etc. After cooking for 2 & 1/2 minutes, I carefully removed the popcorn bowl (as it miraculously transforms itself into).<br />Now comes the little tricky part. Instruction on the bowl clearly indicates how to handle the bowl and how to remove the top plastic off the bowl, so as to dig in and help yourself with the buttery popcorn. So I tried opening the bowl by pulling the plastic from one side, but to no avail. So I tried the other side with more frustration and no better result. I contemplated using a scissor to cut the plastic open, but then I would have to clean the scissor, since all the residual butter would be transferred to the scissor creating a mess. I was surprised that all this hype and commercial about bowl popcorn really amounts to such bad packaging. Then, I forcefully pried open the plastic and got hot residual vapors on my fingers. Boy, what a scalding experience it was!! But I endured the agony so as to try this new popcorn.<br /><br />Taste: Popcorn kernels were large and uniform, and so were popped popcorn. It smelled very buttery, very aromatic indeed. They were crunchy, buttery and crisp. However, I could not have distinguished this final product from the regular Orville Redenbacher popcorns from regular paper bags.<br /><br />Conclusion: If this product tastes the same as regular same brand paper bag product, why am I spending 3 times more money to buy this item? So that I could just eat from a bowl instead of a paper bag? Now I am not a dodo and neither are regular Amazon customers looking for a better bang for their buck, so then what on the earth would make one shell out more money? I am amazed at the marketing department at work here. Do they really think that giving people bowl instead of a paper bag would somehow cast a Harry Potter like spell on us and force us to buy this product on a regular basis? Well guess again marketing guys, as far as I am concerned, No Popcorn Bowl for me. If you like the idea of eating your popcorn from a paper bowl, and if you are willing to put up with the inconvenience and mess and higher price, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Clear instructions<br />2) Tempting packaging<br />3) Giant uniform popcorn<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) EXPENSIVE<br />2) No easy way to tear apart the plastic top off the final popcorn bowl<br />3) Did I mention EXPENSIVE"
37718,B004PXEZAE,AX58YMRGBMYIY,8/31/12,0,0,2,"Messy, difficult to use new bag. Less popcorn.","Pros:<br /><br />The popcorn tastes the same as it always has. Good.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The plastic pop-up bowl packaging doesn't work very well. It's difficult to open. If you're not careful you'll end up spilling the popcorn all over the place while trying to open the bag. You might also burn yourself.<br /><br />I know some people like to eat out of the bag, and if you do you will find this experience quite messy. The plastic portion of the bag does not soak up the oil like a traditional paper bag, so it gets all over your hands.<br /><br />After popping 4 bags in 2 different microwaves, I have come to the conclusion that these new bags simply do not pop as well as the old ones. I have more unpopped kernels, and visibly less popcorn when I pour it out into a separate bowl to eat (which I prefer). And 1 of the 4 bags leaked some oil into the microwave.<br /><br />The new bags are smaller than the old ones; 2.69 ounces compared to 2.9 (which used to be 3.3 ounces not too long ago.) Is this new packaging really just a scheme to hide a price increase?<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />2 stars.<br /><br />Start with 4 stars for the taste; about as good as microwave popcorn gets, but not as good as homemade. Subtract 1 star for the smaller package, and another for the messy new bag."

While the product has a lot of salt, I stilll found it rather tasteless.  The curry's texture was not pleasant.  Many curries that I enjoy most are thick and have a tomato paste type texture.  This one was watery with semi-mashed up chunks of vegetables.  It was not pleasant on the tongue and even combining it with rice and naan did not make it something I would want to eat again.<br /><br />This product is packaged in the ever-popular pouch inside of a box. I don't really like pouches because the contents are usually difficult to remove. True to my previous experience with pouches, I had to use a spatula to remove the contents that had stuck to the pouch's walls. Another reason for my disdain of pouches is they are not typically recyclable.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this product is lacking.  Each container has 2 1/2 servings and a serving is about _ cup.  So, let's look at the numbers for a container, which would realistically serve two people when paired with rice, naan, or vegetables; the total fat per container is 37.5 grams, total sodium is 2300 mg, total saturated fat is 6.25 grams, total carbs of 40 grams.<br /><br />I've found Kitchens of India products to be hit or miss in terms of taste.  I like Jyoti products (come in a can for the most part) MTR products (come in a pouch) better.  Disclaimer: While some Jyoti products (their saag, for example) are healthy, MTR products are typically full fat but at least they taste better.<br /><br />This product is vegetarian but not vegan.<br /><br />This product is made in India.<br /><br />If you really want to try this product and only want one pouch, consider iherb.com.

I wasn't aware that it was actually a different formula that has artificial flavor added. The two packages are almost identical in appearance. You have to read the fine print on the lower portion of the front of the package just below where it says ""Herbal Tea Blend"". One will say Natural and the other (as shown by Amazon here) will say Natural and Artificial Flavor.<br /><br />In talking with a representative at Good Earth, I have been informed that they still make Sweet & Spicy without the artificial flavor. I expressed my concern as to their lack of clear differentiation on packaging. Buyer beware!<br /><br />Update: I have since purchased some of the Natural (no artificial flavor) and found that it too was quite different than I had been used to. Not only was the flavor different but it was very weak compared to the old stuff, which I could easily get two cups out of.

Since it came in six canisters, they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark, no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea, no matter how much tea you use, it still stays light and has a grassy, nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it, I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very, very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing, no leaves in sight, just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar, any tea can taste decent. This tea just didn't work for me on any level.<br /><br />You may want to try the Rishi or Bentleys. They are more expensive but they taste better.

Literally, they are all very slim and their fur is coarse and patchy, as opposed to my dog, who is muscular, with fur is as soft as cotton, and as happy as can be.<br /><br />If you want an all- inclusive dog food that will handle your dog's nutritional needs, this is not the dog food for you.

There are three flavors:  Eggnog, Pepperment Bark, and IN THE PICTURE it shows Chocolate Pecan Pie.<br /><br />1) Eggnog -- this flavor is terrible.  It tastes like toxic levels of nutmeg, which is poisonous in large quantities.  After one square I was burping nutmeg all day.  I will not risk any more.  Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />2) Peppermint Bark -- Always fantastick, one of the best.  A blend of smooth milk and white chocolates with a refreshing, not overwhelming, peppermint kick.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />3) Pumpkin Spice Caramel -- NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED!!!  After I received the package, I noticed that in the product description language it did say ""Pumpkin Spice Caramel"", and there's a product substitution disclaimer as well.  So caveat emptor and all that.  Still, having anticipated and looked forward to trying the Chocolate Pecan Pie, this was a let down.  It's not bad, though a bit heavy-handed on the spices for my taste (nothing like the egregious nutmeg in the Eggnog -- this flavor was just not to my taste, that's all).  The real problem for me in the end was that I don't think of PUMPKIN for the winter holiday season, in a bag with little snowflakes on it no less.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'm sticking to Peppermint Bark in future."

Also the sweetener that they used is VERY artificial tasting.  I am a Splenda and an Equal user so I wasn't looking for real sugar taste but this is just weird tasting.

It use to give me the extra kick and energy I needed... through the morning... another through the afternoon. RECENTLY though when I drink just a small amount I get 'VERTIGO' which will last for a few days, actually causing me to miss 2 days of work. I fell ok when I am sitting or lying down, but when I stand I am dizzy and it lasts for days. Also, the muscles in the back and on the side of my neck ache, directly behind and below the back of my ears. This is still an after effect that has lasted since I first experienced this. After initially having the dizziness effect, a month later I wanted to put my theory to the test so I bought another box from my local Costco and took just a few drinks and AGAIN the same effects occurred causing me miss work. NOW I HAVE NEW INFORMATION - My 24 yr old son ( who occasionally would use Zipfizz ) has reported the same effect with his latest use of the product. This leads me to believe they have changed something... or there was ONE HUGE BAD BATCH of the stuff made somewhere. Draw your own conclusions, just my experience. Thanks, Don"

However, the grape flavor of ZipFizz is just awful - its got to be the worst tasting thing I've ever drank. I can get used to the flavor after a while, I'm sure.<br /><br />I'm drinking my second bottle of this stuff today. (84,000% recommended daily amount of B12 anyone?) I don't feel any energy effects what so ever. No jitters, no boost of energy, nothing. Maybe they should scale back on the B12 and focus a little more on energy and taste?<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but this stuff hasn't worked for me. I doubt I'll finish the entire case, I'm having problems just finishing this second bottle. It's a shame too since I really enjoy energy drinks overall.

Personally, I like the sharp edge that this only hints at.<br /><br />What's not: Vanilla. I meean, I like vanilla, and the warm vanilla musk fills my nose more than with anything else I can remember - including most vanilla ice cream.

It does take some time to make however so I decided to look for a good canned chili to have on hand when I needed a quick fix and didn't have time to make from scratch. I chose this chili because I like a spicy chili and was drawn to the habanero peppers.<br />First of all, there is no way there are habanero peppers in this chili. I was shocked when I took my first bite and there was almost no heat at all. So the dynamite hot label is extremely misleading. On a heat scale of 1 to 10, I would honestly give this a 1 or 2 tops.<br />The chili also has a strange greasy taste and feel in your mouth when you eat it. After adding hot sauce and cheese,it was not so bad when eaten with tortilla chips. I will eat the other 5 cans doing the same thing but will not eat it out of the can as is.<br />In conclusion, I give it 2 stars because it is edible but not very enjoyable. I will not buy this product again and will look elsewhere for a good canned chili or just make big batches and freeze it."

I will not make another cup of tea from it, but my kitties are loving it. If your buying for cats or you have had dried catnip tea and liked it, this may be the tea for you, but if your used to fresh catnip this one will not make you purrrrr."

I haven't tried chocolate but vanilla is very tasty, especially with (skim)or almond milk.<br /><br />In response to a user comment, yes this product is marketed as an ""appetite suppressor"" rather than protein shake - however, if you're trying to lose weight - you will need to avoid sugary products, such as this. Spring for a protein shake with MORE protein and LESS sugar. The EAS Whey Protein will NOT taste as good - Special K drinks do taste much better - that is for sure (18 grams of sugar!). Sometimes as a 'treat' I will take 1 scoop EAS Whey Protein (chocolate) , 1 banana, 1 cup almond milk and 1 cup ice - blend well in a blender - and you have a DELICIOUS and HEALTHY protein shake."

38739,B008XDL38O,A35W3JQYP0M655,10/5/12,0,0,2,Ok Stock....Really Disappointing On Fixens.,"I picked up a pouch of this soup at a local market just recently.  I have always loved a good minestrone soup and make it home made a lot.  However like many others at times I like to keep it quick and easy, and a ready in no time bag of stock and fixens often fits the bill nicely.  Unfortunately this soup was quick and easy all right, but that is pretty much where most of the goodness of it ended.  The recipe calls for 6 cups of water plus a 15oz can of tomato sauce.  I opted for only 5 cups of water since I prefer a thicker, heartier soup.  But as I mixed it all together it was obvious as it simmered that this was going to be a really loose watery soup, even with using less water than directed.  Oh, the pouch has a nice list of ingredients on it, including pasta, bell pepper, onion, celery, etc, but both the size and quantity of them all  leaves much to be desired.  The stock itself was not bad.  It was not overly salty, was mildly spicy and tasted passable enough.  But with every spoonful that's pretty much what you got every time.  A lot of stock with a few pitiful pieces of fixens floating around in it...<br /><br />Like all soup mixes, the pouch recommends some stir in suggestions.  Like sausage, hamburger, beans, and cabbage for example.  But in my opinion if you want to enjoy a hearty soup for dinner on some cold night at all with this, plan on a stir in suggestion being not an option, but a must.  And even then I suggest you use less than the 6 cups of water suggested.  An even more sensible option is to forget this entirely and opt for a much better choice for a pouch style soup mix in the Bear Creek brand minestrone. Available here on Amazon, and in lots of local markets.  Its decently hearty all by itself, and is superior with some meat or other suggestion tossed in.  And you even get more stock and fixens for about the same price as this Cuginos brand.  All in all I cannot recommend this mix.  Either try the Bear Creek or other mix, or go home made... : )"

The Jacobs doesn't make as much coffee though.<br />This coffee tastes like vending machine coffee at a highway rest stop - the kind from a machine that hasn't been tended to recently.

I initially thought, ""oh a whole can of the peanuts like you find in the toffee popcorn/peanut mixes.""  And they are somewhat like that.  The problem is there is a lot of the peanut ""skin"" in the can too, and you constantly have to pick it out of your handful.  One of my daughters is enjoying them but I don't like them at all."

The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor is very mild, not ""Alfredo"" at all, but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good. The overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese. It is, however, a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 (or maybe 2 adults + 1 child).<br /><br />What is there is indeed easy to make, and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box. If you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe, then this is OK. However, if you're looking for a high-quality meal, look elsewhere. The mexican-style version of this with the rice is much better tastewise, for the same price."

They should probably re-label this product to ""tuna soup"" since this is really what this is. The pieces are so tiny that they literally ooze out of the can as you drain the water out of it.

I have ordered what I thought was the same product before, the label has changed but I didn't think too much of that. The issues I have with this product are - it has water as an added ingredient, I know the light coconut milk has water added but I have never purchased full fat coconut milk with water added, it has no ""solids"" in the can, the full fat milk I have purchased before (I thought this was the exact same thing) had a good chunk of solids at the top, this is straight liquid and to top it off the cans are a mess! I ordered 12 cans total and I think at least 9 are dented, one significantly. Just very unhappy, if I had wanted light coconut milk I would have ordered it."

But no Irish Creme. Not at all.<br />Very disappointing since it's nearly impossible to find Irish Creme in any local stores, and that is why I resorted to ordering it from here and from what seemed to be a respectable brand in the first place.

They have these hard things in them that can break your<br />teeth! So quality control is not being monitored and I'm going to call the company and<br />let them know that the last 4 boxes I've purchased are not up to par.

However, our daughter could not drink it because the powder created too many bubbles once mixed (and we tried all the tricks - mixed it with a spoon, kept it in the refrigerator for hours...). We now feed our daughter the ready-to-feed Enfamil AR and it works like a charm. But the powder was not an answer for us."

It's a waste for those who are not doubling up on servings. It takes 5 minutes to prepare at which time the oatmeal is barely warm and needs to be reheated.  I expected fresher, bolder flavors. Typically a 'gourmet' type oatmeal in single servings has fresher flavor from the fruit and even a little natural sweetness negating the need for sweeteners, but not this one. Quaker Real Medley's outshine this product by far."

Today, I noticed several grains in my cup, so rathr than waste a cup, I strained it through a filter and enjoyed my cup.  I have bought Tully's before, but nt from this seller.

39495,B000FDLB8M,A2DGJ1UBWCJ9RG,9/22/10,1,1,2,Great Taste - Poor Packaging,I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them. Two of the four contained absolutely no protective packaging to prevent them from moving around or being crushed. One box was crushed severely on one end and as a result two of the boxes containing the breadsticks was also crushed. Some of these boxes contain little more than bread crumbs. I have opened several boxes and have yet to come across even one whole breadstick let alone a box with the entire amount whole.<br /><br />I wanted to use these for gifts at Christmas presented with a decorated container to set them in and homemade spaghetti sauce and salad dressing. I would not purchase these unless you want to use them for breading.

But - I have had to use AT LEAST 4-5 times as much compared to KAL to sweeten most items, and for some items (i.e. my high protein breakfast drink) it just disappears. Never has quite the same ""sweet"" effect of the KAL either."
39535,B00028P3CK,A2AF0NOCM71J0B,1/13/12,1,1,2,Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia,"I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did."

I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

When I buy them locally they are plump an as juicy as a dried fruit can be. These came in a 4 pack and most of them were dried up little hard nuggets. Not very good at all. Will go back to buying them locally I guess.
40135,B000PNIPPO,A1YHDVLEH17BX4,5/16/12,0,0,2,Too Sweet/Sticky,These are a little over the top. With Chex Mix you kind of want the sweet and salty balancing.

I feed her can food, and hard food, and I mix up brands to give her a good ""spread"". When I saw this at my local store, I thought ""She is going to love this!""<br /><br />For starters, it comes out of the pack in a strange gelatinous form. (It looks like something from another planet, honestly.) You can see the fish, so I was optimistic. She ate some of the gooey gelatin stuff, sniffed the fish, and started meowing (meaning, please don't let me eat this.) I left it out thinking she would maybe nibble on it more when I wasn't looking, and needless to say, a few hours later, it was still there, only it had dried up significantly. (The gel stuff was gone, it looked like something out of a horror movie, and this happened during the 6 hours I was at work.)<br /><br />**If you have OUTDOOR kitties, don't even go here. This food attracts flies like nothing I've ever seen, and if your kitties don't eat it, you will find yourself with a colony of maggots in a day or two, no kidding.

The pot is a very inexpensive 'growers' pot, and does not add at all to the over-all look and appeal of this half-dead plant.  My plant contains two braided brown trunks with no foliage, and three yellowish stalks with yellowed leafs.  The 'braid' is held together at the top with a green bread twist-tie.  Over all, I wish I had spent a little more money and ordered a better plant from a different supplier, and I should have made sure the pot was nice enough to keep the plant in for some time while adding to the decor of my home.  With the ill-health of this plant, I am afraid to upgrade the planter/pot as I might further stress this suffering little thing.  Maybe this one should have been called the ""waste of money tree'.  If you really want one of these, look elsewhere - this one is just not worth it."

These capsules continue to get jammed in the machine and we have to reach in, struggle with the capsule to pry it loose before we can make another coffee.<br />4. Since 10 capsules are packaged in one plastic sleeve, the moment we open the sleeve, air comes into contact with the remaining capsules minimizing their freshness.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the espresso coffee is not worth the lower cost to purchase these capsules."

The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."

However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.

The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first."

It tastes like strongly-flavored puffed rice covered in chocolate and my first impression was ""chocolate covered popcorn"".  Mine was so melted it was soup and I had to put in the freezer to make it edible.  The melting and refreezing made it waxy and a somewhat unpleasant, unrecognizable mound of candy with which I had to literally peel the wrapper off.  My rating here is for the taste and texture only although it may or may not have tasted better if not ruined.<br /><br />*Also beware of ordering this if you live in a warm climate.  I don't enjoy receiving melted chocolate and had no other problems with any other chocolate melting that I ordered from other sources that month.  I'll assume it was the product ingredients making it susceptible to melting easily so it should have had special warm-weather wrapping when this is a problem.  Even though the vendor shipped more quickly than usual the product was ruined.  Many chocolate companies won't even sell their products during the warm months unless they can adjust to this problem and neither should this one. No refund or partial refund was even offered by the seller (O.E.I.) yet I was hounded constantly by them about my ""seller review"" per half a dozen telephone calls. I eventually deleted the seller review for reasons I'll not explain further. In my opinion, this is an over-priced waste of money."

I agree with my fellow reviewers who say it tastes good. It's exactly like coca-cola in flavour, except that it's not quite as sweet.  (And thus, doesn't even approach Pepsi-Cola in intensity of sweetness.)  No matter -- I just add a few packets of my own favourite artificial sweetener....<br /><br />This syrup, however, lists ""High Fructose Corn Syrup and/or Sucrose"" as its first ingredient.  Sucrose is another word for sugar....bad enough, but at least it's been used for thousands and thousands of years, and most people, throughout history, who have imbibed sucrose/sugar, have lead relatively normal,(and normal-length), lives.  But High Fructose Corn Syrup, though also natural, is a somewhat modern invention.  Thus, the claim above the name, ""Cola Syrup"", right in the middle of the front of the label, (that this is an ""Old Fashioned Remedy"") is patently false.<br />(H.F. Corn Syrup was first -- unsuccessfully -- produced in 1957, and then sucessfully mass-produced and introduced into foods in 1975.)  Even if you are born in 2010, anything that has been around in foods for only 35 years, (since 1975), can hardly be called ""old-fashioned""!  Also, the listing of TWO ingredients, (""High-Fructose Corn Syrup AND / OR Sucrose""), as the possible number one, (largest amount) ingredient, is misleading, confusing, and (almost?) a violation of the law which mandates ingredients in food be listed in descending order of their amounts.  Are these ""And/Or"" ingredients listed alphabetically?  In order of how many bottles have HFCS, and how many have sucrose?  And how does one know, (if one is not a celebrity and is possibly being given the bottle for advertisement purposes), if the bottle one has purchased have the HFCS or the Sucrose?<br /><br />It is also totally astonishing to me that, according to the bottle, this product's manufacturer, BAAR, is the official supplier of Edgar Cayce Products!  The insignia of ""Cayce Care"" is, indeed, on this label!  And although the insignia is quite pretty, (a gold-outlined, white, horizontal oval, with a pretty little maple-leaf between the words ""Cayce"" and ""Care""), I simply<br />CANNOT believe that those who presently run the ""Edgar Cayce Foundation"" would ever condone the use of high-fructose corn syrup<br />in any of their products!  (Edgar Cayce himself probably never<br />heard of H.F.C.S, as he himself died in 1945.  Of course, Mr. Cayce is justly famous for his predictions of the future, (which he found whilst sleeping) -- but I am quite certain, (after reading up on H.F.C.S., on Wikipedia and elsewhere), that if Mr.<br />Cayce ever DID dream of H.F.C.S., he probably put it in the ""nightmare"" classification, and tried to forget all about it as much, and as soon, as possible!  In his place, I know that's what I would have done!)  To find high-fructose corn syrup in an Edgar Cayce Product is totally beyond belief. For myself, I will continue to admire, and research the modest, but completely genuine and gifted genuis who was Edgar Cayce -- but I will get my cola syrup elsewhere!<br /><br />And, where elsewhere?  From SodaSteam Soda Mix!  Slightly more expensive than this ""Baar"" Cola Syrup, it gives one: 1) A much, much thicker syrup, but the same 16 ounce size  2) Sweetening with SPLENDA.  Many people are down on Splenda, but it has been cited as the safest of the artificial sweeteners by David Zinczenko, of the ""Eat This -- Not That"" series of books.  Too much of anything is not good, of course, (I found that using too much Splenda gave me, personally, elevated readings on my liver tests....so I cut down) -- but from all I've read, Splenda is better than High-Fructose Corn Syrup, by a couple of miles!<br /><br />So, it's SodaStream Soda Mix Cola flavour for me.  If I find a healthier alternative than that, I will switch, (and hopefully be able to share my discoveries in an Amazon review).  But, as of now, I don't think I will buy BAAR Cola Syrup, (Old-Fashioned Remedy....?????), thin, watery, and most probably laced with High-Fructose Corn Syrup, ever again!<br /><br />Near the bottom of the front of the label, it proclaims that this cola syrup, ""Soothes Stomach Upset"".  But knowing I know now, this effect is, for my stomach, very, very temporary, at best.  H.F.C.S. -- ""High-Fake-Customer-Switcheroo"" syrup, is not something that I recommmend....for anyone!"

Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved. The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better. They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey. We mix in some Wysong ""Call of the Wild"" into the meat.<br /><br />They love the taste of the beef, but it seems to irritate their tummies.  I had a lot of yuckiness to clean up after they eat this, so I don't buy it anymore.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild. I have trouble imagining a kitty cat taking down a big ol' cow, so it makes sense that it didn't go over well with them!"

But these, they are way more caramel-y than they are licorice-y.  You know the caramels (Brach's?) that you can buy in a bag and melt after you've unwrapped each piece to make caramel apples?  These are like those.  They have a grainy, very sugary texture.  Although the licorice flavor is okay, it's clear that this ""licorice"" is just caramel in disguise.  They seem way more geared to the American palate than to the European taste. (there's no ""zout"" to these at all.) These Gustaf's licorice caramels are a poor substitute for European ""caramel"" (toffee).  I won't be buying these again.<br /><br />For a better choice or replacement for the famed Callard & Browser licorice that you might remember, try Walker's NonSuch toffee.  It's awesome, and I wish Amazon currently had it available.  Once you try Walker's licorice toffee, nothing else will do."

We tried baby talking, tried bribery, tried everything but force feeding, the brats wouldn't got NEAR this stuff!<br /><br />  Ok, now dogs. Well here is a completely different result. Every dog we tried simply DEVOURED the stuff. Now, when I walk out to get the mail I almost fear for my life with the way these dogs eyeball me:-) But has anyone ever read the label? The far content of 20% plus makes me a pet owner who would NEVER feed this to my pet. Not even as a treat. The manufacturer seems to almost (to me anyway) market this as a pet health food? Sorry, don't care what pet loves it or hates it, I would never give any to any pet since I love them way too much to feed them all that I see on that label. Every time I complain to out Veterinarian about how big our cats are he explains that they are perfect actually. That they are just very large and STRONG, that it is not fat and not to worry. Sure different that what MY doctor tells Me....<br /><br />  Again, I am no Vet, but read the label, look that best friend you call a pet in the eye and ask yourself if you feel right about stuffing it with fat?"
41951,B006Q7YFLQ,A2BPB05QNCE00B,7/31/12,0,0,2,Not for Cats,"I have 3 cats with 3 different personalities. None of them were impressed with these treats at all. I gave each one of them a fourth of a treat as I have small cats and the treats are rather large. All three were interested as I was getting the packaging open. Two of the cats tried to eat the treat, but they were not able to chew it. One gave up after just a little bit and the other gave it a pretty good effort and even came back to try again a minute later. Then I decided to take another treat and crumble it up really good. I laid it out for them. One cat actually ate a few pieces, but that was it. The second cat didn't even come over to try and the third actually tried to bury it."
41953,B006Q7YFLQ,A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,7/30/12,0,0,2,My cat doesn't like it,"It indicates on the package as well as on the product page at the Nature's Variety site that this product is for dogs and cats. My cat does not of course speak for all cats, but my cat does not like this product. She sniffed the piece I offered her, then licked it, then walked away. I broke a small piece off and put it in a clean dish in case she might try it later. (I'd rate my cat a 5 on a finicky scale of 1-10.)<br /><br />Later when I was in the kitchen, I saw her go to the dish and take a nibble of the product. Within seconds she started to retch (something she rarely does).<br /><br />Based on this I would say don't buy this product unless and until you've had a chance to discover if your cat or cats will actually eat it."
41958,B006Q7YFLQ,A35LT14WG5BX0T,7/18/12,0,0,2,I wasn't impressed...,"Okay, first of all, this says for dogs AND cats, and I sampled it because it actually only said ""cat treats.""  Ummm, I have three cats, and none of them would touch this stuff.  First of all, they're HUGE, round discs.  You have to break it up into about 30 pieces (which is soft and gross and makes your hands stink) and even then, none of my cats were at all enthused with the results.  They sniffed, turned their nose up, and walked away.<br /><br />The dog however, was happy to clean up behind them.  She loved these treats, and they're definitely more large-dog size.  Each treat is a couple inches in diameter, almost an inch thick, I have NO IDEA why they would label these as cat treats.<br /><br />They're a little expensive for what they are, and there aren't that many in the package.  However the ingredients are good, and my dog loved them.  I'm just pretty disappointed these weren't cat treats since that's what I had originally wanted.<br /><br />Good for dogs, find something else if you have a cat!"
41978,B006Q7YFLQ,A3TSJ9KDY18X1L,7/9/12,0,0,2,the cat wouldn't eat it,"I was excited to get some new treats for my cat. When I had the package in front of her she was rubbing all aganist it so I was hoping she would like them. I gave one to her whole at first and she ignored it. I thought the treat may be too big for her since they were a bit bigger than silver dollars so I broke it up and put it in her food dish with some of her food. She basically ate all her food but ignored the pieces of the treat.<br /><br />I do like that there is nothing artificial in these treats. The box states that what is contained in the treats include: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove. However, even if it is all natural, if the cat won't eat it, it does me no good.<br /><br />I know all cats and dogs are different so some will like the treats. However for me, I will not be buying these in the future."
41989,B006Q7YFLQ,A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ,7/2/12,1,2,2,Two out of three cats say NO.,"Was it the sound of the plastic bag or the smell? Anyway, two of my cats came running when I opened the package. These things are WAY too big for cats, so I broke off pieces for each of them. The girl ate a piece after much pawing, but would not eat a second small piece. The boy sniffed and sniffed and pawed and pawed, but wouldn't eat a bit, and both of them left. Then our third cat walked in, obviously intrigued by the smell. He ate the others' leftovers and looked around for more. So, I guess that's about a 33 percent acceptance rate.<br /><br />Besides being way too big for cats, these things look... weird is the nicest word I can think of. They look like hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes. They even have weird hair-like things sticking out of them.<br /><br />The ingredients include pumpkin seeds, apples, carrots, squash, flax seeds, broccoli, and more plant products. Cats eat meat. And I really have to wonder what function another ingredient, ""Montmorillonite Clay"" (a.k.a. Fullers Earth) serves.<br /><br />These are sized for a medium to large dog (following the directions, an average cat should get less than half a ""cookie"" per day--if they even want one), and it seems to me the ingredients are more suited for dogs as well...if you are OK with the clay."
41991,B006Q7YFLQ,A2V0H5HIN4OWKN,7/12/12,0,1,2,Weird,"I don't really know what to make of these treats.  I was first drawn to them because of the claim they were for both cats and dogs and since it is something of an extra special treat it's nice to have something the whole family can enjoy.  But I was not impressed on any level.  Lets be honest, we all by these over priced pet treats for ourselves and not the pets.  If you honestly wanted to make your pet ecstatic you would go to the butcher shop, get tub of chicken livers or giblets, cook them up and have very happy pets.  For me this product is outrageously expensive, has an offensive smell and a texture of sawdust.<br /><br />The makers are trying to draw you in with this idea of it being ""Raw"" but do you want to feed a pet, or better yet even handle a product where the main ingredient is chicken if it actually is raw?  Though it doesn't say so on the package I don't think this item is actually freeze dried raw meat, but instead is supposed to appeal to the human's desire to feed their pet something that's healthy, i.e. raw diet for dogs.  But I see nothing in this item to make it any healthier than many other pet treats that are much cheaper in price.  I was also a little shocked at some of the health claims made on the package too.  Apparently, ""Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidents of ear infections and healthier teeth & gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experienced.""  I have to call B.S. on that claim.<br /><br />The only real positive thing I can say about this product is that on one cat loved it.  My dog and other cat ate it, but weren't crazy about it.<br /><br />2 stars."

I decided to check Amazon to see if they had them.<br /><br />Amazon had them listed as 4 pound bags so I snatched up all 5 bags the seller NACM had left in stock.  I was supposed to receive 5 FOUR pound bags for a total of $31.40.  NACM sent me 5 ONE pound bags instead.  I received the packages and immediately knew there was an error.  I contacted the seller straight away to tell them of the issue.  For some reason they assumed I was being dishonest and greedy???  They were defensive even though I told them Amazon has the listed as 4 pound bags.<br /><br />I sent several emails back and forth, being courteous each time, and their response was always in the context that I was trying to take advantage of them.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon customer service for the first time in over 100 transactions.  Was on chat with someone from Mumbai or India.  I was getting the run around.  ""Contact the seller""......""Amazon is like a mall and the individual sellers are like small stores within that mall""......""we will not get involved unless the seller refuses to refund your money"".<br /><br />At this point I thought I was stuck with beans at $6.28/pound.  I can purchase 16 pounds of these everyday for about $48.00 on another site. And less than $3.00 per 1 pound bag at a box store.  So I thought $31.40 was a pretty good deal.  The kind of deals that Amazon is known for.<br /><br />Fast forward to the next day.  I got on chat with Donovan from the US.  He researched and saw that these were incorrectly listed by Amazon as 4 pound bags and I was due compensation.  He gave me a promotional credit and I was happy.<br /><br />I contacted NACM and told them that I would NOT remove my negative feedback because of the unprofessional and accusatory way they handled the situation.  They tried to make me feel like a thief again.  I don't know any buyer who appreciates being accused of being distrustful, greedy or an out right liar.<br /><br />Here's the feedback we left each other:<br /><br />Date: August 29, 2012 Feedback 1/5:  ""These were listed as 4 pound bags of beans by Amazon. I rec'd 1 pound bags instead. Paying $6.28 x 5 ($31.40) is NOT what I had in mind. NACM claim that I misread the listing and are not helpful at all. Claim filed""<br />=====================================<br />Seller Response: The beans is listed as $6.28 + free shipping for a 14oz bag, but I sent him 16oz bags. Nowhere has Amazon listed it as 4lb. Where can he get a 4lb pink beans for $6.28 plus free shipping.Customer is trying to be super greedy<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />The beans themselves are PERFECT.  The seller NACM should be avoided at all cost.<br /><br />There are 4 pound bags of these listed here on Amazon for $9.79 + shipping.  The photo listed shows a 14oz bag instead.  What I would receive if I placed another order for these in a 4 pound bag?  I'll never know because I'm getting these elsewhere next time."

Perhaps having enjoyed so many authentic and freshly prepared meals (we cook a lot of Indian dishes and use fresh spices) both at home and in restaurants, I had higher expectations than other reviewers. Would definitely NOT recommend.<br /><br />The paste was hard to mix (so that the chicken was coated evenly) and the ""Sauce"" consistency was runny. (And I used even less water than suggested.)<br /><br />You'd be better off with one of the many sauces in a jar (if you can stand all the salt), if you can't make fresh.<br /><br />It's too easy to just create your own sauce from scratch. Better flavor, which is the bottom line."

So I gave it a shot, in spite of my usual preference for organic or fair trade teas. Sadly, there is an unpleasantly strong perfumey odor and taste to this Earl Grey and when I looked at the ingredients, the reason was quite clear. It is comprised of whole leaf black tea along with natural and ARTIFICIAL flavors. Why the artificial flavors? Isn't a top quality oil of bergamot enough? It is for me. Unfortunately, grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon, so I'm stuck with three tins of tea that I will probably never drink."

Listed below are my opinions about said creamer when used in both normal coffee (unflavored medium roast) as well as flavored coffee.  Both types of coffee were ground that day.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The amount of creamer you receive borders on the ridiculous.  The package has to contain near 8 lbs. of creamer.<br />The creamer is individually packaged and arrives in four cartons (each containing 50 creamers).<br />The cartons are easy to open and have a flap to allow for easy access.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />The creamer is VERY weak.  To receive the same texture / coloring / flavoring as a traditional creamer (one in a bottle), you must use roughly 50% more of this creamer.<br />The vanilla taste is very minimal.<br />The cinnamon taste is very prevalent.<br />the cinnamon taste is rather repugnant and almost has a sour taste to it.<br />The individual creamers are rather hard to open (not that they are difficult to grab the flap, but there is a ton of glue used, and most often (7/10 times) will tear because the flap is glued down to heavily.<br /><br />~~~~<br /><br />In all, I would not recommend this product.  I've actually tried to give the creamer away to several people, but after tasting it, no one wants it.  Even at work, with the ~175 remaining creamers sitting there, after a week, the first container is still not empty (meaning, that of the 175 I brought, there are still more than 150 sitting there)."

If the prices don't go back down I may not be getting this much longer. At the least I could have been e-mailed letting me know about the price change but I didn't even get that. For me to find out this way with an automatic withdrawal from my account is pretty messed up. Amazon should rethink the way they do things otherwise they will definately be losing my business."

These bulbs are brighter (1900 lumens) but use 30 watts of electricity (1/3 more) and cost $40.81 for a 6-pack ($6.80 each !!).

I replaced a 100 watt incandescent and although this bulb claimed an equivalent output of a 125 watt bulb, it definitely does not provide the amount of light that my 100 watt bulbs put out.<br /><br />So for now, it's incandescents for me until LED lighting becomes affordable enough and I'll give that a try.<br /><br />Yes, I'll still try to use these for energy savings in places where I'm not so concerned with the quality of light (my garage, the porch light, a closet, etc."

However, the green tea with jasmine (which comes with this tea pot) has a very heavy scent and really smells like some cheap perfume. Not at all like I expected, or like anything I would want to drink. Watching the flower open is still nice and the tea would probably work if you want to put it in a spray bottle and spritz some on behind the ears before going out.

42636,B001WAL1O6,A2JA1MKOKHMZ0H,9/2/11,5,5,2,"Excellent bulb, but misleading description - NOT ""super mini""","First, I would give this bulb 5 stars if the description was correct, and will happily change my rating if that is fixed! The problem is that these are not ""super mini"" bulbs. Earthmate does make a 2700K super mini bulb that is 4.6"" long, but the only 23W full-spectrum bulb they list, at 5"" long, is this one. (The actual model number for this bulb is E2357AE on their website, which matches the individual units of the 6-pack.)<br /><br />These bulbs are fairly pricey compared to the average 23 watt full-spectrum bulb, and I paid the extra money partially based on the assumption that these would be smaller.<br /><br />Now, on to actually reviewing the product! The bulbs are average sized, and should fit in most lamps and fixtures; however, I did have one fixture where they were just a bit too long to fit. The brightness and coloration are excellent; they seem to put out a bit more light than other 23W full-spectrum bulbs I have. The CRI is 88; not the highest around but very good. The light is extremely close to my ALZO bulbs, which are still my favorite full-spectrum bulbs (other than the fact that they're huge and don't fit in most things!) The bulbs turn on to a fairly decent brightness and fully warm up very quickly. I've noticed zero buzzing or flickering.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are the best 23W full-spectrum bulbs I've tried that are ""normal"" sized, which is the only thing that kept me from just returning the 5-pack despite the size issue. (Yes, 5-pack, since one of my bulbs was DOA. Amazon was nice enough to offer a partial refund for that bulb, which I decided was better than shipping all six bulbs back and forth.) They're also a bit expensive as noted; the price would be more in line if they were actually smaller as claimed.<br /><br />(I did contact Amazon with links to the manufacturer's information in hopes that they fix the description and/or stock actual ""super mini"" bulbs, assuming Earthmate actually makes them in a full-spectrum version! I would love to have this product in a smaller version, if it exists...)<br /><br />Sep 7 edit: Down to 4 working bulbs after having these bulbs in for 4 days. :( The one that just died was in a fixture paired with another of the same... I'm going to give them another couple weeks and see if any more die before I decide whether to return them or have them all replaced. It's possible it was shipping damage since the outer box arrived crushed (though the product box was fine), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Oct 4 edit: I had the bulbs replaced a couple weeks ago. Whoever packed them wasn't too bright, since he or she just stuck a FedEx label on the product box without any extra packaging! Not cool for shipping light bulbs, Amazon. Only 4 bulbs arrived working, certainly due to shipping damage this time. Fortunately Amazon told me to do whatever with the first shipment rather than return it, so I have 8 working bulbs now, which I can't complain about since no more have died since then. (Of course, they're still not ""super mini"" as listed, so my review remains at 2 stars instead of 5.)"

Three of them were unusable out of the package due to flickering/buzzing problems. The rest have died during normal use. Really like the light color and efficiency, but these bulbs definitely don't last long at all for the price. Pretty disappointing."

I initially thought these had decent brightness, understandably somewhat dimmed compared to other similar 23-watt bulbs because of the full spectrum coatings. Now, however, they have reduced in brightness well beyond their initial levels and 1 of the 6 bulbs failed completely. For the price, this is a significant investment of money and I expected them to last much longer, especially since they are only used 20 or so hours per week. Essentially I'm at an estimated 2k or 3k (max) hours of use and I think it's time to replace them because we have 4 bulbs (2 each in 2 overhead fixtures) in one 13' x 16' room and it's hard to see at night because these bulbs have lost so much luminance. So the 8,000 hour lifespan is fairly misleading if my 6 bulbs are typical of the quality you can expect."

Very bright white.  Bummer.  I guess I'll have to stick to the GE 'A' cfl bulb I got at the grocery store."

I was surprised when I discovered these sticks were actually thin plastic straws filled with honey!  There is no way I'm going to insert a plastic straw into a hot cup of tea. I'm not sure it would work anyway; I suppose you could cut open each end and then blow the honey in the tea.  Does Stash think you're going to sip on these straws?  I don't know what the company was thinking when they produced this product, other than as a candy to be eaten.<br /><br />I believe the term ""stick"" does not accurately describe this product and is misleading.  I doubt it's intentional, however.  The Stash Tea Company is an excellent company and has many high quality teas and products.<br /><br />The honey flavored with chai spices is good enough but frankly, it it a very expensive way to buy honey.  Better to buy a jar and flavor it yourself.  I wound up using these Chai Honey Sticks by cutting open one end and pressing out the honey into a tea cup/pot, which was messy and time consuming.<br /><br />I love Stash tea... drink it every morning.

Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of what I got.<br /><br />When I brewed my first batch of this tea, I noticed the very green color, which is hard to find in teas from America. But, when I started to smell the tea as it was steeping, it smelled like something familiar, but I just couldn't put my finger on it. The smell wasn't exactly bad, but it was definitely not how I wanted my tea to smell. Eventually it hit me. This tea smelled like CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP!<br /><br />At first I thought I was crazy, until other people would walk into my house and ask if I was making soup... The taste is very strong, and unusual. Needless to say, I only used about 4 out of the 100 tea bags. I won't be buying again."

Then I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and chocolate pretty much became a no-no. Through careful experimentation though, I discovered I could occasionally enjoy a square of dark chocolate with higher cacao percentages because they have less sugar. I began to appreciate the flavor of chocolate without the milky sweetness and have since been a big fan.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind I'm always trying new brands and blends in search of the perfect dark chocolate bar. Unfortunately, as much as I love Newman's Own as a company and many of their other products this chocolate was just not for me. It's too sweet and the vanilla taste came through strong. It melted into a watery consistency in my mouth and almost had an alcohol-like tang to it. Once I'd noticed that tang I checked the ingredient list and sure enough it's made with chocolate liquor which some may like but I personally don't care for when I reach for dark chocolate.<br /><br />At only 54% cocoa this is pretty low on the spectrum of darker chocolates and with it's texture would be a great introduction to dark chocolate for someone who doesn't like it usually. It kind of reminded me of an oversweetened version of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBRY0Y"">Lindt Lindor Truffles Dark Chocolate, 60-Count Box</a>'s centers. If you like organic and fairtrade chocolate this is certainly not a bad place to start but I would recommend trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFWQR6"">Theo Classic Organic (70% Cacao) Dark Chocolate, 3-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> (or any other Theo chocolate bars which are my FAVORITE Organic and Fair trade chocolate products) if you're looking for something similar but with a higher cocoa content."
42846,B002NHYQAS,A4IL0CLL27Q33,2/23/11,3,5,2,Disappointing on a number of levels,"My wife and I independently taste-tested this product. My wife is a regular consumer of dark chocolates while I tend to prefer milk chocolate, and/or chocolates with fillings. After trying it out, we both decided that we would not purchase this product in the future, though for different reasons. Here are our independent reviews:<br /><br />My wife: I am confused by the labeling of this product. It is called a 'dark chocolate' but has a 54% cacao content. Most dark chocolates that I buy have upwards of 65% - 75% cacao. When I first opened the package, I noticed a smoky aroma. I eat a lot of dark chocolate, including raw chocolate, but I never noticed such a smoky aroma before and found it pleasant. My first bite was disappointing. It is a bit too sweet for me, and is certainly significantly sweeter than the dark chocolates that I buy. It is smooth, which I like. While I appreciate the fact that Newman's own is producing an organic, minimally processed, chocolate I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Me: From my first bite I knew that this chocolate was not for me. It had a distinctly waxy feel that I usually associate with inferior chocolates - this was an immediate turnoff. There was absolutely nothing distinctive about this chocolate - no fruity notes, no particular bitterness, nothing that sticks out. While this chocolate is better than a lot of what constitutes the mass market, I cannot recommend it."
42850,B002NHYQAS,A8ZEIMTD8NDOV,2/27/11,1,2,2,"Good texture, lacks flavor.","I'll keep it short: I like chocolate, especially good chocolate.  While this bar may be organic, with great texture (not waxy), the flavor seems to have been left out.  It's labeled ""dark chocolate"", which it is, but it's also very, very bland.  I ate most of the bar, just broken into pieces, trying to decide if it's something I'd use for baking.  I wouldn't.  I'm not a big fan of Ghiradelli, but I'd use their chocolate in baking before I'd use this.  If you're looking for a mild dark chocolate bar with great texture, this is for you (not as bitter as Hershey's Dark).  But if you're looking for a good, strong-flavored, dark chocolate - keep looking."
42867,B002NHYQAS,A2806I45H42REF,2/23/11,1,2,2,Not Calorie Worthy,"I love chocolate and was really disappointed by the weak, almost non-existent chocolate taste of this bar.  Since there are no milk solids in dark chocolate, it is supposed to provide a deeper pronounced chocolate flavor.  However, this bar doesn't provide much in the way of chocolate flavor. There's no immense pleasure derived as the chocolate melts in your mouth which makes the bar not worthy of its caloric content.<br /><br />Break off a piece and hold it against the roof of your mouth and run your tongue over the bottom of it.  It feels sort of waxy, and it takes a bit of work before the chocolate flavor starts to come through, and when it does, it's nothing to really appreciate.  Flat tasting is a good way to describe this bar.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this, and I don't recommend it."

However, I did not like this one. In fact, I spit it out. I don't think I've ever done that before..<br />It is much closer in taste to a milk chocolate, but even at that lacked any real flavor. There was no depth to this at all, none. It was bland, yet too sweet for dark chocolate, lacking any real chocolate experience at all.<br />If you appreciate dark chocolate, I recommend you check out Chocolove products, or Endangered Species brand. I've never been disappointed in either of those brands."

42874,B002NHYQAS,APRU373UYVK2Y,2/23/11,1,2,2,Skip this bar,"I generally like items from other Newman's product lines as they always seem to have a great, borderline decadent flavor.  So I was genuinely surprised at how disappointing this bar was.  I love dark chocolate and when given a choice will always choose it over milk chocolate, but I found this bar to be bitter, almost burnt tasting, and the texture was exceptionally gritty.  To be fair, dark chocolate isn't going to have the silky texture of milk chocolate, but that doesn't mean it should crumble in your mouth.  All in all a very disappointing experience."
42879,B002NHYQAS,A18YKLOLBAO1E1,2/22/11,1,2,2,"i love your movies, paul, but not your dark chocolate","first off, the size of the box this bar of chocolate arrived in was ridiculous. it could have fit at least 50 bars or more. c'mon, amazon, you can do better.<br /><br />now to the real review, which i should qualify by saying i prefer my chocolate 70% dark. this is only 54%, which i failed to notice when i requested this vine product. that said, this tasted too much like milk chocolate. milk chocolate in a bland, mass-produced, thoughtless way. this is just boring chocolate. it's ersatz chocolate. basically, once you've gone dark, you can't go back. and this, for me, was back."
42891,B002NHYQAS,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,3/4/11,2,4,2,I expected a lot more from the Newman's Own brand.,"I have tried a couple of products from the Newman's Own line and, while I didn't necessarily think they were better than their competitors' products of the same type, they definitely held their own.  I sadly did not find this to be true with the Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.<br /><br />When it comes to reviewing edible products, I find it helpful to compare and contrast with a similar product from another brand.  Because I love Dove Dark Chocolate (though I try many different kinds of dark chocolate), I used the Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate Bar as comparison (though I prefer the Dove Promise individual bites, it was easier to compare bar to bar).<br /><br />The Dove Dark Bar is 33 grams and the serving size is the entire bar.  The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is 64 grams, nearly double the size of the Dove Bar, and still 1 serving is considered the entire bar.  Now, I am as much of a chocolate lover as the next person (probably more, in fact), but there is no way I need nor want to eat to consume 64g of chocolate in one sitting (especially sub-par chocolate).<br /><br />In most nutritional areas, especially fat and sat fat, the 33g Dove bar and the 64g Newman bar are almost equal if you consider that one is double the size of the other.  Newman's only clear win over the Dove bar is on cholesterol, having 0mg even though it is double the size of the Dove (which has 5mg cholesterol).  For those watching sugar, the smaller Dove bar has 17g while Big Daddy Newman has 37g.<br /><br />With the health business out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks--taste and texture:<br /><br />Texture.  I am accustomed to the smooth, creamy texture of Dove dark chocolate--I find its mouth feel luxurious.  My initial thought on biting into and chewing the Newman was waxiness--quite nasty at first but, once I got it chewed, it had a nicer mouth feel.  It is not creamy like Dove, but it loses the waxiness once chewed.<br /><br />Taste.  The only thing particularly pleasant to me about the Newman bar was the finish...the very last taste as you're swallowing it.  That has a deep rich dark chocolate taste and, despite the 37g of sugar in it, is not overly sweet, which is nice.  As for Dove, the entire process of biting into it, chewing it and swallowing it is enjoyable, so there is no contest.<br /><br />In summary, if you have your heart set on contributing to Newman's Own because of the good work they do, or you must have an organic chocolate bar, I suppose this will do.  But it is not, in my opinion, any competition for ANY other brand of good dark chocolate I have tried."

I've liked dark chocolate for years but I started eating a bit more recently. I've tried several different brands from the store. All were at least good with some being a little better than others.<br /><br />So. While not scientific my personal taste experience says this dark chocolate bar taste terrible.<br /><br />If you are looking for that silky smooth deep rich dark chocolate flavor that sort of infuses your whole body starting with the tongue and culminating in a very pleasing feeling in your nogging look elsewhere. My God.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are really into organics and go out of your way to eat all things organic then perhaps this is your chocolate bar. 54% is not a very dark bar and I think it shows in the taste of this bar. The taste could also be due to the organic nature of the bar. That being the case, if you prefer that organic experience, that taste that organics typically have I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For everyone else, the flavor is off with strange undertones. Not inedible just not very tasty.<br /><br />The bars are fairly small at 2.25 ounces. That isn't really a knock since moderation in all things is a good habit."

In truth I've always thought the Newman chocolate bars to be overly sweet and not particularly rich tasting. I thought from the hype that this new line of products would be different but I sad to report that is simply not the case here. In fact these new gourmet bars taste much the same as the standard line of Newman's own chocolates. There is still the problem of being overly sweet and considering how dark these are supposed to be, they don't have that deep rich dark chocolate flavor and texture that I am always looking for.<br /><br />n summary I just want to be clear and say that if you are looking for that killer concentrated rich dark chocolate flavor I'm sorry to report that you won't find it here."

I shared this bar with my kids: a daughter who loves dark chocolate and my some who will only eat milk chocolate.<br /><br />Me: I do not consider 54% cacao to be dark chocolate, that's a bit of a mislabel. The flavor was very bland. I'm glad it's organic and all that, but if it doesn't taste that great, why buy it?<br /><br />My daughter: Kinda waxy, like a Hershey bar, and it's too sweet. This bar is about the same size as a Hershey bar too.<br /><br />My son: I'd rather have a Hershey bar, this is too dry."

So we had high hopes for this chocolate. But sadly, those hopes were not fulfilled. The chocolate is good, not overly sweet, but just does not seem to rise to premium grade. The mouth feel was not as silky or smooth as we would like, and frankly a bit waxy. And there was something just not very distinctive to the chocolatiness of it all."
42983,B002NHYQAS,A106Q1A6LGU4DP,3/1/11,0,0,2,Sweeter than I'm used to,"I love chocolate, and indulge in it regularly. When I buy bar chocolate, I always buy dark. Now I don't go crazy and get the 85 or even 90% cocoa, but usually anywhere from 50-70ish% is great. Normally I love Newman's Own products, from their salad dressings, to lemonade, and even my dogs like the dog snacks. However, this chocolate falls short.<br /><br />It's VERY sweet, much sweeter than regular dark chocolate. I found the texture a little lacking, also-- somewhat crumbly and unappealing. (It brings to mind the episode of ""Friends"" when Monica had to work with a product called ""Mockolate"" and she said she loved the way it crumbled in her mouth.) I have to admit I was expecting a little more from this brand, and am let down.<br /><br />I'm not a fan, and don't see myself finishing the bar. I might just give it to someone who enjoys milk chocolate."
42986,B002NHYQAS,A3G25AHB4CHEZ6,2/28/11,0,0,2,Disappointing,"You call this dark?!<br /><br />I love dark chocolate--the darker, the better: anything in the 80%+ cacao range is just dandy, as far as I'm concerned. Admittedly, it should have been obvious from the 54% designation on the wrapper that this was in another category altogether--call it ""dark chocolate lite,"" for people who would really rather just have a Hershey bar. But I guess I had hoped that the fact that it was organic and fair-traded would somehow make up for the missing cacao. In general, I really support what Newman's Own is trying to accomplish.<br /><br />Alas, it was not to be. My main objection is that it tastes mass produced, like a so-called high-end chocolate bar you'd buy in a supermarket but that really is just a run-of-the-mill bar imported from Europe. In particular, there's a subtle but annoying undertaste that I don't detect in the other dark chocolate bars I'm fond of. I don't know if it's the soy lecithin or something related to how it's processed--there really are very few ingredients, which is good--but each bite has elicited nothing more than ""eh"" from me. I shared some of it with a chocoholic friend who also has a fondness for the really dark stuff, and her reaction was the same as mine.<br /><br />As a taste test, I bought one of Newman's Own's 70% cacao bars, which was the darkest I could find in that line in my local health food store, and it was somewhat better--at least the undertaste was missing. But it too falls short of what I seek in my empty calories, so I won't be buying any more of these, at least not until I see cacao content of 80%+.<br /><br />If you enjoy very dark chocolate, try Equal Exchange's 80% (lovely texture), Endangered Species 88% (with the black panther on the wrapper) or Valrhona's 85%. There's really no comparison.<br /><br />Two stars for an organic, fair-traded but otherwise insipid product."

The candybar itself is half the size and more than twice the price of other dark choclate bars that are so similar in taste that the real bitter after-taste will be in your wallet. I would be more inclined to eat this more often if the pricing were more reasonable. Even if you are trying to do the right thing ecologically all the more reason you should not be punished by paying more for it."

I was unable to complete one shower with this ""shower tool"" I had to go back to my normal pouf.  If you like roughness when you take a shower and no lather with your soap than this item is for you.

So if you are planning on storing this and not using it all within 6 months, I suggest you buy it elsewhere. If you plan to use it all within 6 months than it is the best value for your money (maybe because it is discounted for being old stock).

I would have preferred a more vague time endpoint and directions to watch for boiling.  The resulting food is quite bland as other reviewers have noted, and what this ""low-sodium"" (330 mg) soup really needed was more salt.  The flavors that were present were nondescript, neither the couscous nor the lentils providing a distinctive flavor note.  I kept looking at the package to see what kind of flavor I should have been expecting.  The texture was also pretty monotonous, and the couscous itself did not have the best texture, which was disappointing because good couscous is not that hard to make.  As for healthy eating, the product is essentially pasta with lentils added to provide some protein and fiber, and with 37 grams of carbs the 190 calories are pretty empty -- not all that much different from macaroni with low-fat cheese.

Please heed its caution with the utmost of seriousness.<br /><br />If you come across a bag like this, do not open it. The consequences will be great, but I'll get to those later. As for proper disposal, do not let ANYONE see these, as they might be tempted into opening them, seeing the deceptive word ""cookie"" included in the title. You have two options, both of which require items that are difficult to obtain, but which are the only acceptable ways for destruction to ensure these ruinous abominations don't return as even worse creatures. The first is to find some thermite or a similar accelerant that can burn this at over 4000 degrees F. The second option is to use a rocket that can escape Earth's orbit; you must carefully calculate the route to the Sun so that these don't get slingshotted back to us (we cannot risk something like this).<br /><br />As for the consequences: If you've ever seen a Roland Emmerich film (Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, 2012, Godzilla, etc.) you will recall shots of people running horrified from a central location, scrambling in all futility to escape inexplicable horrors. What I've discovered from months of digging and ""Deep Throat"" style meetings in shady parking garages is that Emmerich adds all of the special effects in post-production, but uses these very cookies as ""inspiration"" for the extras in his film. Finally, you'll understand why all of the lead actors are awful (even talented actors like John Cusack), but all of the extras provide incredibly convincing performances.<br /><br />Andrew Johnson is widely regarded the worst president in US history. Imagine his remains being fermented like sauerkraut, sealed in jars, and then put into a time capsule to be unveiled by this horrendous ""Joseph"" character over 100 years later. The festering stink will stick with you for months. It's as if a skunk mated with sin and the scent was diabolically baked into an innocent-looking cookie.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1 is that these cookies have given me the most amazing idea for a spec horror screenplay. My career as a Hollywood screenwriter will flourish due to these incomprehensibly awful monstrosities."

These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads.

I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case.

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."

Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack."

There is a bitter artificial sweetener taste (remember saccharin?), as well as a hint of artificial butter flavoring; never tasted that in any Maple & Brown Sugar product. For me, it's even a little too salty. These noticeable flavors overwhelm the M&BS goodness.<br /><br />I bought this at a supermarket, and am debating whether to throw the rest out (have strong moral issues with wasting food), or saving it for an emergency.

I'd rather be overweight and enjoy my food... but if you arent as picky as I am, maybe you'll like this.  Buy a smaller quantity first thought to be sure."

I logged on to trusty ol' Amazon to see if I could order just cinnamon or just banana bread. They're way more expensive than this flavor, and here's why: this is the worst one. It smells fine, at first, like pancake syrup, but then you realize that you can smell it for days after you've cooked it. Seriously. My husband asked me last Saturday if I was making something for breakfast, and when I told him no, he looked at me strangely. Later he told me that he thought I had cooked myself some breakfast and didn't want to share! The smell was from this flavored oatmeal I had made on WEDNESDAY. Even just picking it up while shuffling through and looking for a cinnamon packet can cause the smell to linger on your hands for hours. The taste is pretty strong, too...it's not necessarily bad, it's just overpowering. Like I said, it smells like pancake syrup, and that's pretty much what it tastes like--really sweet syrup. I would advise you go out and buy one variety box at the store before committing yourself to 4 whole boxes of syrupy sweetness."

I use the Senseo pods simply for convenience sake.  And since they have different flavors, I figured I'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now Senseo coffee in general tends to be better than most any store pre-ground, canned, or mass produced brand, like Folgers or Maxwell House.  But that's not saying a whole lot.  I find these to be kind of bitter, but the one saving grace is that I like the frothy finish.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the inconsistency.  When I initially wrote this review, I was drinking my first package that came in a four-pack.  It actually tasted kind of fresh, and I liked it.  However, the next two packages were quite stale.  I have now tried a different brand of coffee pod which really blows this one out of the water.<br /><br />One to help make better coffee with your Senseo coffee maker:  Don't brew as soon as the red light stops flashing.  Let it warm up a few more minutes before you hit the brew button.<br /><br />Also, there are some pretty good pods out there, and they are not expensive.  You can even get fair trade and organic blends along with single origin coffees.  Shop around.  The Senseo brand pods are about the worst pods I've tried, but since they are better than Folgiers, I give them two stars."

Look, I've bought Bumblebee tuna before and don't remember it being this bad. But this, which is supposed to be white albacore in water, is just the worst quality of tuna I have ever bought. The tuna doesn't look like white albacore at all, but more like the regular, flaky, grainy, browner textured regular tuna.  There is none of the pale, steak-like, albacore consistency in the tuna in these cans at all.<br /><br />It is literally the worst quality of albacore tuna I can ever remember buying.<br /><br />(Meanwhile, if you care about quality, I would suggest the Sustainable Seas albacore as an alternative. It's not much more expensive and the quality is terrific. We bought that shortly after this, and were blown away by how good it was.

44668,B001EQ55RW,A36PFPY4O3E1DV,5/22/08,7,9,2,Bad taste,"I was quite excited to try these cocoa roasted almonds out. I love almonds and I love chocolate. And most reviews of this product imply that you get your fix of both, without the extra sugar.<br />Well there's definitely a whole lot less sugar in this thing - it tastes pretty bad to me. And I was quite shocked. I guess I need at least a little more sweet. But I'm shocked because I'm not THAT much of a sweet tooth. It's the bitter after-taste that really bothers me with this product. I really couldn't take it.<br />So just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond. Think again! This is really just cocoa and almond, and, for me, that left a very bad taste."

They are slightly sweet and I don't think the Splenda taste is overwhelming or unpleasant, but that is obviously a personal preference. Bought them on sale at Target for $3 a package, or about half the current listed price here."

They're not very ""chocolatey"" tasting, but they have a very strong artificial sweetener kind of aftertaste. I can't recommend these on any level.<br /><br />I gave these two stars instead of one simply  because they were on sale cheap when I got them. If they had been at regular price, one star would have been generous."
44715,B001EQ55RW,ABSYIF0ONC2AF,7/8/09,2,4,2,"decent taste, crap ingredients mixed with nuts","These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that label makes no mention that is uses sucralose (aka Splenda) and modified food starch (aka MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome, so it's not worth it putting this garbage into your body. I guess Emerald doesn't realize that the whole point of buying nuts instead of junk food is so that people have a healthier diet.<br /><br />This is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage, all the other brands I've seen have more natural ingredients. Stay away from Emerald brand."

And I looked at the ingredients and it uses sucralose. Why didn't they label this as a sugar-free version and also market a real sugar option? I can't stand any artificial sweeteners. I won't buy it again."

(especially fond of smoked almonds) and I like chocolate.<br />However the combination of the dry cocoa powder, which is slightly bitter, and the dry unsalted taste of the almond doesn't really seem to work.<br />Frankly first impression is one of blandness.<br />Maybe because my palette leans toward the sweet side, these just seem bland.  The combination almost offsets the benefits of either taste.  It's just not a sweet taste, and that was what I expected."
44755,B001EQ55RW,A1NSJHH59U8EKD,5/18/08,2,2,2,I did not care for this.,"I was first disappointed to read the ingredient list and find chemical names that I don't even recognize.  It wasn't horrible, but I'd rather have a more pure product.<br /><br />I popped a handful in my mouth and at first thought the flavor was good, but very quickly came a bitter or stale after-taste.<br /><br />Definitely not something I'd recommend.  We'll be tossing these out for the birds and the squirrels."

If you are expecting chocolate covered almonds, you'll be disappointed.  They are what they say however; ""cocoa roasted"".  They have a modest cocoa flavor with a bit of sweetness.<br /><br />The reason I gave them only 2 stars is because they fail to disclose on the front label that they contain not only one but two artificial sweeteners.  This annoys me because 1) artificial sweeteners bother my stomach and 2) many people don't want to eat artificial sweeteners or give them to their kids.  It irks me when manufacturers try to pawn their wares as a ""healthy"" snack yet omit the fact that they contain artificial sweeteners or ingredients.<br /><br />One used to be able to spot artificial sweeteners easily by ""sugar free"" or ""NutraSweet"" clearly printed on the label but for some reason, the FSA allows products to contain sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda) without any clear labeling at all.  You must read the ingredients to learn these nuts contain both sucralose and acesulfame potassium, two artificial sweeteners.  Shame on you Emerald!"

However, shortly thereafter I had that awful aftertaste in my mouth of artificial sweetener. In shock, I looked at the ingredients and sure enough, there was the dreaded ingredient.<br /><br />All-in-all, not bad if you don't mind artificial sweetener. I hate the stuff so these were not for me."
44810,B001EQ55RW,A3OO4WIO4SKD55,5/28/08,5,7,2,Not That great.,"While the Almond taste is on point, the chocolate taste is not. They were pretty much just plain dry roasted almonds with Cocoa powder mixed with Splenda sprinkled on them. I could only really taste the chocolate with my first bite. After a few bites, All I could taste is almond. The light chocolate taste was just a little too light for me. And for someone who eats chocolate like it's becoming extinct, this is a bad thing. Plus, the chocolate powder was very difficult to remove from my hands.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great Almond Flavor<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Just a hint of chocolate - for others this may be a pro but for me, EH, not such a good thing<br />2. Coated in a messy chocolate powder. - It's Best if you have mouth to canister contact when eating these.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I've had better."

As other reviewers have mentioned, they do have a bit of an after taste too.

I appreciate that it's super healthy, but it tastes very bland and the texture is rock hard (think grape nuts w/ hard raisins). I feel like I'm going to lose my fillings w/ every bite. I tried soaking it in milk for a few minutes but to no avail. The box suggests serving it either cold or hot after cooking it over the stove. I can see why it should be cooked soft.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this cereal but I don't. My husband hates it too. We're wondering how we're ever going to finish all 6 boxes (I'm mixing it w/ other cereals for now)."

She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

45135,B003EJ3YPM,A2XFDZGLZWH7W6,10/18/11,2,5,2,Overpriced and overrated,"Not going to lie - I got these due to the packaging. Hey, I had money left over, so why not get a nice high quality brownie mix too?<br /><br />For a little bit of background, I love to home-bake and I'm the kind of guy that enjoys waking up to a nice breakfast I prepare for myself. I have a deep respect and interest in appreciating quality over quanity. Granted I'll get the cheapo brand for a lot of stuff, but when it comes to something I don't regularly make (like Brownies or Pancakes) I'll totally go up a notch and either buy the nicer brand or get good quality ingredients to scratch-cook it myself (with college and work though, I only do scratch cooking now if time and patience permits!).<br /><br />However I was pretty disappointed by these. By far, at about $4.68 per box at my local store, this was the most expensive brownie mix you could get on the shelf (keep in mind you still need to have all the other ingredients including the oil, eggs, butter). I'm a huge fan of skipping fillers and keeping to the good stuff so I tried them out.<br /><br />Unfortunatly, these brownies bake pretty dry. The moist fudgy/cake-like taste you expect from brownies was totally absent and their texture is closer to a thick gingerbread more than anything. They taste noticably worse than even the 99c brownies you can buy, and the wheat-nature of the brownies doesn't seem to enough of a saving grace to warrant an insane $5 price tag per small box (I love whole wheat, I only buy whole wheat bread and enjoy wheat pancakes). Mind you they don't taste bad, but they simply aren't what you'd expect out of a $5 box of brownies.<br /><br />As far as health goes, for a fraction of the price, you can easily scratch-cook your own brownies using coco and whole wheat flour for a fraction of the cost. As a matter of fact, that's pretty much what the ingredients are for this - so if you are a fan of wholesome no-bull baked goods, you're better off just making it yourself. And seeing how easy brownies are to make, its not a major inconvenience to do this either. If I am going all out on buying a dessert mix (what this brand is priced at), you might as well put the tiny amount of extra effort to combine the coco and flour yourself. If I am in the mood for no-frills, then I can get a better tasting experience just buying 99c brownies (even if it uses white enriched instead of whole wheat)."

If you order directly from the manufacturers web site, you will probably pay twenty dollars or more in shipping which is outrageous!  Now the negatives...  I was born and raised in Hawaii and the delicious shave ice there is a common treat, much like ice cream in the continental US.  Sorry, but these syrups barely taste like the ones in Hawaii.  I sampled the cherry and it tasted very much like cherry cough syrup, yuck!  But that's not what really ticked me off.  Looking at the ingredients listed on the bottle, instead of cane sugar (which Hawaii used to produce and distribute in abundance), the second main ingredient listed after water is high fructose corn syrup.  Double yuck!  I'll stick with the Davinci syrups which use cane sugar and to me and my kids, taste a lot better.  This company needs to rethink it's ingredients, especially when they claim they use quality ingredients."

It was half dead when I got it, and the company said I could pay to return it to them, and would have to have it packaged in a certain way.  Cost more to ship back.  I kept it and I am still not happy.  I bought a few plant from them.  I have a green thumb and love house plants, but these were not worth it."

However, somehow I've never tried any of their spinach pasta before, my store doesn't carry it. I ordered from amazon and I tried the spinach spaghetti and have to say I thought it had no spinach taste at all, it just has a pale green color. The texture was a little weird too, kind of glassy with a very slippery texture. Still cooked to a firm texture but too slippery for anything to stick to it and no spinach taste. Even with just olive oil and fresh parmesan it was just plain to me and all the cheese ended up on the bottom of the bowl because it didn't stick to the slippery noodles. I like a very spinachy pasta, I much prefer Hodgson Mill Whole wheat spinach pasta, it is toothy and hardy and has far more spinach flavor. I wouldn't buy this again but I still love every other De Cecco pasta I've tried and their regular whole wheat linguine is wonderful."

It smelled good, but after the first sip it tasted a little like Theraflu.  There was definitely a medicine-like aftertaste that I was not expecting.  Might be OK if it was diluted to give a little punch to a pot of herbal tea, but as a stand alone instant beverage it had a strange taste that was neither appealing or relaxing."
45527,B0041NYV8E,A2V9DTXTQ5YIMK,4/1/12,0,0,2,"Hard to swallow, painful actually.","If you are wondering what size the contents are, it is like receiving a Theraflu packet. The foil cover that is in the description is again, like Theraflu where you cut the top of the `foil cover' off and pour the contents into a mug with water. I then warmed the mix and water; I used extra water and warmed it up in the microwave. On the back of the contents, it reads: For Hot Serving: Pour contents, add hot water (250ml) stir and serve immediately.<br /><br />Since it calls for 1 cup of water, I used almost twice as much since I do not like strong flavors. Even with two cups, ALL I could taste was the Ginger. Don't get me wrong, I love to eat ginger, but the flavor is so overpowering. It actually hurt my throat each time I sipped it. Not from the heat of the water, but the hotness of the spices. It states it has lemon to it; I could not taste lemon at all. I tried a few sips and it hurt my throat so much I had to stop. I know ginger is good for motion sickness, I have been suffering from extreme vertigo caused by a medical condition and did not feel the effect, however, I probably did not consume enough of it. I have drunk bad tasting stuff before but this is beyond bad, it actually hurts to drink. A drink should not be painful.<br /><br />After trying to get a few sips down I had a guest over and asked if they wanted to try my drink. They agreed and the word was ""awful!""<br /><br />I know drinks and flavors vary by person but I am surprised that anyone would drink this. I can also see why it aids in digestion by your body not wanting it to stay in your body and to get out.<br /><br />I liked that it was caffeine free but the taste was the worse ever. Even worse than medicines I HAVE to take and can't stand. To those who like and love it, more power to you. I will make sure not to buy again and hope there is plenty in stock for those who do praise it.<br /><br />Sadly, I cannot recommend this at all!"

Sadly, I took one sip of it, and had to spit it out, I couldn't taste any lemon, all I tasted was ginger (which is fine since its a ginger drink, but its the TEXTURE I take issue with!) and that it essentially tasted (texture-wise) like I'd put a bunch of ginger powder in a glass with some sugar and hot water in a blender and dumped it in a glass and called it good.  I would have gotten the same results had I done that, and it would be cheaper too.<br /><br />  It was grainy, and it was way too gingery for my taste.  Now, let me tell you, I DO enjoy ginger tea!  I make ginger tea from fresh ginger root for nausea or just to enjoy and it is very tasty, I also enjoy ginger chews on occasion, and crystallize ginger every now and then as a snack as well, so I am not a ginger hater!  But, for me, this drink was just lacking, and you'd be better off making a nice cup of hot ginger tea from fresh ginger root, its cheaper, has a better feel in your mouth, and its not going to take anymore work then this ""beverage"" will.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy"
45532,B0041NYV8E,A39GKCZWTMG27E,3/28/12,0,0,2,Ginger and Lemon All Natural Instant Beverage not so good.,"Gold Kili has been in production for many years in Singapore.  I know most ginger is grown in China.  However, when I mixed this drink with hot water--the taste was so strong, I poured it out.  I love ginger and ginger ale, but this was just too strong.<br /><br /> I think for a really natural drink, buy your own ginger and mix it with real lemon and honey from the United States.  That way you can control the bite of the ginger and the sweetness of the honey.<br /><br />Ad said, made with "" top grade ginger and honey to give a unique taste, providing goodness and fragrance when consumed.""  The fragrance was nice so I was hoping for a great taste.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Ingredients: Ginger, Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose) and Natural Lemon Flavor."
45535,B0041NYV8E,A3T1LD0C65QCWK,3/28/12,0,0,2,Whew. Kind of rough on the tongue.,"Not in the sense of texture, of course, but of taste -- LOTS of ginger flavor, I couldn't stand more than a couple of sips after mixing the drink up per instructions. Pleasant aroma but the taste was like razor wire mixed with fresh ginger and it's still locked on my tongue an hour later. WAY too strong. I enjoy strong flavors and I like ginger, but this was just way too much."
45539,B0041NYV8E,A19V2TRL68EOHV,3/25/12,0,0,2,Yuck,"First let me say that it's refreshing to get something from Vine to eart or drink and be obligated to comment on nothing but its flavor, as opposed to half a dozen claims by the product's makers about its health effects, nutritious contents, etc.<br /><br />Alas, that was all the refreshment I got out of this beverage.<br /><br />It's not exactly disgusting, but the taste is pretty unpleasant.  The mix of ginger to lemon is way off, I think, and the ginger is fairly overpowering; the spiciness of it actually burned my sinuses a bit.  And I mixed the powder into a little more water than the instructions called for, which makes that intensity of flavor way too much.  As for the lemon, it's just flavorful enough to provide a sour background to the concentrated spiciness.  The combination is not pleasant at all.  Having tasted it once, I think I can safely say I will never drink this  beverage again."
45542,B0041NYV8E,A19KLUZ1XD3SRN,3/25/12,0,0,2,Strong and sweet,"I prefer ginger tea when I'm feeling under the weather but don't often have fresh ginger on hand.  I tried Gold Kill All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage in the hope that this might be a convenient alternative to fresh ginger tea.<br /><br />Gold Kill All Natural has a strong ginger taste.  I used nearly 50% more water than the amount suggested, but the ginger tea was still much too sweet for me.  If you like your drinks very sweet, you might enjoy Gold Kill.  I would have liked it better if it had 1/3rd the sugar."
45547,B0041NYV8E,A3U029B8Z5WGI2,3/22/12,0,0,2,Could Do without the Lemon,"I'm a huge fan of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C"">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and was excited to try out Gold Kili Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage.  I usually add lemon juice to my Ginger Honey Crystals anyways...why not try a brand that has it included?  You can drink it either hot or cold - I added hot water to mine, as I like ginger tea.  To my dismay, the Kili Ginger Lemon Bev was not very good.  The ginger has a very light kick, and wasn't as spicy as most ginger teas.  The lemon flavor was overpowering.  They should rename this the Lemon & Ginger Bev mix, as that's what it tasted like to me.  Even after adding a little milk and honey to it, it still didn't have a good flavor.  If you like the Ginger Honey Crystals, you probably won't like the Gold Kili brand...it's not particularly gingery and the lemon is too strong.  You're better off adjusting the lemon and honey ratio on your own."
45551,B0041NYV8E,A2WB4OWBUH2VQX,3/22/12,0,0,2,My experience with this drink,"I simply did not like this drink. The one plus side to the product was that it dissolved very quickly in the hot water and it didn't leave chunks of power not mixed into the drink. Even at the bottom of the mug there was no residual powder. The taste is not altogether horrid, but it is quite strong and I think needs more lemon to balance out the heavy ginger flavor. I immediately felt my throat start to ache after drinking this and 18 hours later, my throat still feels kind of sore. I did not drink it too hot so I can only deduce that the strong ginger flavor irritated my throat.  I also noticed that the drink left a slight yellowing on my mug which I had to scrub off. I could not recommend this drink due to my own experience with it."
45553,B0041NYV8E,A32WYIUWD2HJHU,3/22/12,0,0,2,Not to My Taste,"I thought the ginger taste was overpowering, like drinking a gingersnap cookie. As a hot drink it didn't really work for me. As for the medicinal properties, I suppose if it makes a cold feel better than maybe."
45561,B0041NYV8E,A1R1BFJCMWX0Y3,3/21/12,0,0,2,Maybe if you're sick,This might be soothing if you are under the weather. This is not the kind of tea I'd like to drink at night relaxing. I found the smell to be very strong and the taste more like medicine. I was not a fan of this. I love Ginger but this was just to overwhelming to enjoy.
45564,B0041NYV8E,ADS99W8WMEXZ2,3/21/12,0,0,2,Strong and overpowering,"I drink a lot of tea and was looking for something with another flavor to try.  I like ginger and know it is supposed to have soothing remedies so I thought this Instant Ginger Lemon Drink would be something to try.  The first thing I noticed was the aroma, it smells great, a very strong ginger smell.  I added the 250ml of water and tried it and it was just so strong.  I did not taste the lemon and the ginger was overpowering. I added double the amount of water and tried it again.  It is still very strong and spicey and to much for me.  I wouldn't purchase this again."
45572,B0041NYV8E,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,3/20/12,0,0,2,"I like some ginger, but this was a bit much","I can handle some ginger, I'm fine with some teas but this combination was a bit much for me. I personally didn't like the overpowering ginger taste. That is my only real gripe."
45576,B0041NYV8E,A2KY76HK8DYRL3,3/20/12,0,0,2,Really really strong!,"I just returned from Singapore and tried a really wonderful ginger tea.  I brought home two giant bags, I was so impressed, so when I saw this product, I gave it a try.  I can honestly say that there is simply no comparison.  Since I only received a packet as a sample, there were no directions on how much to use, but I had assumed it was one packet to a cup of water.  When I gave it a try, I thought it was going to burn a hole in my throat.  Although apparently mixed with honey and lemon, it only enhances the strength of the ginger.  I ended up dumping half the cup out and filling it with more water to see if it would create a more mellow flavor, but it only decreased the flavor while leaving the burning sensation in full strength.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I don't think the lemon is doing this tea any favors.  It simply ends up tasting medicinal, so if you're using it for digestive purposes, colds, and stomach cramping like most ginger teas are alleged to help, then it's probably the way to go, but if you're looking for a good tasting ginger tea with all the health benefits, I would pass on this one."
45585,B0041NYV8E,A1UMSB7LAW0RIR,3/19/12,0,0,2,"Wow, talk about INTENSE flavor. More than just ginger and honey I think.","I am a real fan of ginger and honey. I drink a lot of Republic Of Tea's versions, plus I love those real ginger - ginger ales, the kind that almost burn your throat and you can feel it going all the way down!  Well, Kili's instant beverage is not quite what I'm used to and that is fine, but I did not care for it. As I say, I've had lots of ginger and ginger/honey drinks, but this had some kind of odd flavor to it.<br /><br />First impression, the drink was not a tea, not in a bag etc. When you open the single serving pouch, there are dark granuals inside that you just dump into a  cup. It says to add water but in MLs so I was lucky to fing out my Pyrex measuring cup had MLs on there. I added hot water and stirred it. The color in my cup was pretty dark brown, a lot darker than my teas etc. The scent was okay, not bad. But the flavor, at a very small sip, was super strong. I don't think watering it down would really help either. Also, the ginger aspect was pretty sweet and reminded me of candied ginger, (which I love) but that other flavor, I don't know what it was..was distracting.<br /><br />Personally I would not drink this again and did not try it cold. That might be better but the flavor really put me off. I did like the convenience that the sweetener was already in there, that it was granuals so no teabag to mess with."
45592,B0041NYV8E,A36MP37DITBU6F,3/19/12,0,0,2,Sweet ginger drinks with a spicy kick after swallowing. Not for me.,"I made with 6 ounce of hot water to start and it was a little too sweet for me so added 2 more ounces of cold to cool and  make an 8 ounce cup.  The drink is a brown color. It says honey but it tastes of a mix of honey and sugar very sweet. It tasted of ginger and slight lemon flavor; but after each swallow, I got the hot ginger burn. Too much of a burn to sooth my throat. Hotter than most ginger snaps I eat. It was like after eating a jalapneo pepper. Much hotter than the black pepper after burn of chai tea. It was way too hot for me to finish. Maybe milk will melow it out, but I can not mix lemon and milk.<br />If you like hot spicy drinks or love ginger then this is for you."
45606,B0041NYV8E,A1ACM1CBGORBN1,3/29/12,3,3,2,Way too overpowering on the ginger and not enough lemon,"First of all, I got this because ginger is really good for the body and I love lemons. I am not ginger's biggest fan when it comes to taste so I was hoping that this product would be more balanced because of the lemon. I got the packet and it's easy to mix it into some water and it dissolves pretty well. I could not finish this drink at all. I think I only got half way before it got to be too much for me.<br /><br />The ginger taste is so strong that you really do not taste the lemon at all. There was maybe a tiny bit of lemon flavor but really it was just the ginger flavor. This is great if you are a huge ginger fan but it was definitely not for me and probably for anyone who is just so so on ginger, this will not be their cup of tea. Basically, you are just eating pure ginger.<br /><br />I let my husband have a taste and even he, who is a lot more into ginger than I am, thought it was a bit too much. This should be called instant ginger beverage mix instead of ginger & lemon beverage mix."
45612,B0041NYV8E,A3JPFWKS83R49V,6/18/12,1,1,2,Harsh and Less than Enjoyable,"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon is a powdered drink mix that can be served using either hot or cold water. The fine powder dissolves quickly and the beverage is mixed and ready to drink in less than one minute.<br /><br />I like the taste of lemons and ginger, but I wasn't prepared for the taste of this beverage. I admit that it does have a nice, enticing aroma and the combination of these two ingredients sounds appealing, both for the potential flavor and for the settling effects on the stomach. However, the taste of this beverage is not what I expected. It doesn't taste as natural as I thought it would and it has a certain harshness that is most evident in the back of the throat. I followed the directions and added a cup of hot water, but considering the harsh flavor, perhaps I should have used more water.<br /><br />Among the flavors present, the ginger is the one most noticeable and it's the spicy finish that creates that harshness. I was able to finish mine off by taking only small sips at a time, but I can understand why some would have a difficult time drinking this instant beverage. My enjoyment of spicy foods and drinks made it a little more tolerable for me, but I would bet that others would have a difficult time consuming this drink.<br /><br />Ginger and lemons might be a nice combination, but they don't mesh very well in this instance. I won't be buying this drink again, as I found it less smooth and less enjoyable than its taste combination promises."
45615,B0041NYV8E,A2L35P0VQE7LBN,3/19/12,0,0,2,Ginger Lover But Not This Tea,"I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor. All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger, but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger (if real ginger at all). It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids, the awful bitterness/dryness powered through. Looking for a balanced, smooth, nicely flavored ginger tea? This is not it."
45641,B0041NYV8E,A39LRLKACX89IP,3/6/12,0,0,2,The taste doesn't do it for me....,"I still think that Vine food reviews should include more than one small sample, because you only get a gutcheck reaction and not all products are viable to that method.  This one is not, I did a lot of juicing the month of January and used real ginger root.  It tended to go well with apple and pears, but not with orange, lemons or limes.  Lemons are generally mixable with most things, but I don't like them with ginger, I think ginger is more of a sweet enhancer than something that works with sour.  This was barely drinkable hot, and given the taste it would have felt better if it were caffinated.  Like coffee, maybe if I'd tried a dozen or so, I'd have developed a taste for it, but at first blush, yuk, enough said."
45643,B0041NYV8E,A1FHWJ7EFO3E3U,3/3/12,0,0,2,Sorry I don't like it,"I like all the flavors individually but when packaged together in this drink, I couldn't get past the third taste.  It tasted more like medicine rather than something I'd drink on purpose.  It had a bit of a bite that I didn't care for either.  Sorry, not to my taste."
45646,B0041NYV8E,A1IHK8GL1ESOND,3/2/12,0,0,2,not so good,"My husband and I are huge fans of ginger.  I use in cooking and also in a few hot beverages.  I was very excited to try this product but it failed.<br />The aroma is very strong to begin with and it can be a turn off to some people.<br />The beverage itself was strange.  When you take a sip, you immediately get a very very strong taste of ginger, and it's a biting ginger. Then it diminishes very quickly but there is a great afterbite or aftertaste.  Actually the aftertaste is better than the first taste.  I just found it too incosistent a flavor.<br />It's a great idea but I really think they need to go back and rework the ginger aspect of it.  As for the lemon...what lemon flavor?  Didnt' taste any.<br />I dont' think many people would like this product unless maybe if you mixed it with rum or something."
45655,B0041NYV8E,AB8TX5GQQZTS8,2/27/12,0,0,2,"Lots of Ginger, almost no Lemon","If you like really strong ginger flavor you'll likely enjoy this, but if you were looking for a beverage with ginger and lemon flavor, look elsewhere. It's advertised as a Ginger & Lemon drink, but it's mostly ginger. I didn't notice any lemon flavor at all, and honestly, I couldn't finish it. That was really disappointing, as I like both ginger and lemon and was hoping for a drink that was a nice blend of the two."

It irritated my throat, as most chemical flavorings do.<br /><br />""All Natural"" is one of those throwaway terms, and it is clearly misleading in the name of this product because the ""lemon"" is a chemical flavor and not ""natural."""
45679,B0041NYV8E,AYB8XLKTYMTTX,2/14/12,0,0,2,This instant beverage packs a gingery wallop that's hard to take!,"We don't need to be convinced about the combined, ailment-fighting power of lemon and ginger.  We often make our own home-made brew of water, lots of lemon juice, fresh ginger and honey to soothe everything from congestion and coughs to indigestion and nausea.<br /><br />So Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix seemed to be a good thing to keep in the pantry if you didn't have all of the above ingredients on hand.<br /><br />Made from real ginger and honey, along with a natural lemon flavor, the crystals dissolved very quickly in water.<br /><br />But when it came to drinking the stuff--the ginger was way too overpowering.  I really like ginger and found it far too strong.  It felt like like a rake scraping the back of my throat, and then it left a slightly bitter after-taste.  They say you can adjust the taste by adding less of the packet powder next time, but it seems like a wasteful fuss to us.<br /><br />Next time I'll just make sure to stock extra lemons and ginger in the fridge."
45681,B0041NYV8E,A34TNH973Q9XT0,2/13/12,0,0,2,Odd and intense,"I am having a hard time understanding exactly what went wrong with this drink.  I followed the directions exactly.  I enjoy all of the flavors on their own and have had them combined in other drinks, but this was just wrong.  The flavors were there.  They were intense.  I am not afraid of intense, but they were just off.  It seemed like a drink made from cheap spices that had expired or turned rancid.  First I tried it hot because I am a huge fan of teas.  This is not a tea, so I decided to give it a second chance after it cooled.  I didn't like it either way.  The ginger seemed dusty and old and the lemon was toned down.  It was also very strong and the flavors were off.  It may have been better if it were a backdrop flavor in an actual tea.  I would never purchase this or recommend it to anyone else."
45691,B0041NYV8E,A2XJYQ2V3ZVZFL,2/7/12,0,0,2,Quite a bit too strong for me,"Although I originally was hoping this would be a nice alternative to normal tea or coffee, I just was wrong.  It was incredibly strong.  I wasn't even able to get through a half mug of it.  I sort of liked the basics of the taste;  there was just too much taste.  I cannot recommend this unless you want a VERY heavy taste of ginger.  I think it would have been far better if it was mild ginger."
45692,B0041NYV8E,A2YW1MG1GKU8XD,2/5/12,0,0,2,too strong,I really wanted to like this tea but it was too strong for an 8oz cup of water.  I tried to dilute it some more but it lost the flavor.  It's so strong that I could not taste the honey or the lemon.  It was a good sample but I don't think I'll buy it.  Thanks anyways.
45697,B0041NYV8E,A1H6JP5UC5WVT7,2/3/12,0,0,2,Didn't tickle my taste buds,"Although touted as an all natural beverage, it did not taste that way. I caught what seemed a taste of an artificial sweetener. The maker says it is sweetened by honey, glucose and sucrose. Not anything artificial there. My tongue must have misled me.<br /><br />It matters little, though, since I did not like the taste. I'm fond of ginger, of honey, and of lemon in hot drinks. So I thought this one would tickle my taste buds. But no."
45710,B0041NYV8E,AQNX0WN00JEVE,2/1/12,0,0,2,Not what I expected,"I really had high hopes for this ginger and lemon drink. I've got digestive issues and thought it great there there is something more natural out there than pills and might taste better than a ginger herbal tea. It's not really marketed for that, but why not, it's ginger.<br /><br />That first sip was shocking, and not in a good way. The taste is incredibly strong and left a burning feeling on both my tongue and back of my throat for a couple of minutes each time I took a sip even after it had cooled down quite a bit. Yes I did try a number of sips but I can't say that I developed an appreciation for it. Nor could I finish it.<br /><br />Anyone who actually drinks real ginger tea will actually find more enjoyment in this product.  Unfortunately, I drink too much sweet stuff and this appears to be an acquired taste.<br /><br />It is packaged for convenience.  Instead of a tea bag, you get tea bag-sized packets with a powered mixture.  No tea bags to dispose of."
45711,B0041NYV8E,A38BE06WWL20AY,2/1/12,0,0,2,High Priced,"The crystalized ginger drink tastes much the same as other such drinks readily available at many Asian markets at half the price. I see other reviewers complained about after taste and it being too strong. I haven't run across a ginger drink that is too strong, so maybe it is just me but this one is relatively mild. At first, I didn't taste anything bad in the after taste but I wrote the review before finishing the drink... then went back to revise. Yes, not as good as I thought after the flavor lingers. It is a mediocre product at an premium price."
45713,B0041NYV8E,A1WKQ94M45D8MG,5/26/12,1,1,2,Nasty!,"I received a single serving packet of this item for review. Frankly, it was nasty. I prepared it according to the instructions on the product (add 1 cup of hot water, stir and serve instantly). Yuck. Considering that it was supposed to taste like ginger, honey and perhaps a little lemon flavor - I was not pleased. Then I tried putting it over ice and yes, adding a little sugar. No improvement. I can't see recommending the beverage, buying this or encouraging others to use it despite the medicinal qualities of ginger for motion sickness or the nausea of pregnancy, etc. It did absolutely nothing for my digestion, either.<br /><br />I am sure whether or not you like this will be wholly a matter of personal taste.

So I was fully expecting to enjoy this ginger-flavored beverage. However, it's incredibly strong and pungent taste really hit me for the first sip, and I literally recoiled. A friend of mine also tried it and she had pretty much the same reaction with just barely tasting a drop of it. I didn't dare to offer it to my wife, as she is a ""supertaster,"" and would probably have even more adverse reaction than I. In a nutshell, this is definitely not a beverage for everyone. If you are already familiar with ginger-lemon drinks, then you might appreciate it, but I would advise everyone else to proceed at their own risk."

My first concern was that the directions are in ml instead of oz...so there had to be a math lesson before I could make the drink. That accomplished the steamy drink smelled so delicious. I was sure it would taste as good as it smelled and never even thought about adding a sweetner. The first sip was awful....it didn't taste at all lemony like it smelled. I can't identify the taste but do know my mouth and throat felt an unpleasant,almost stinging sensation. So, I added some sugar. The second and third sip were slightly better, but the stinging sensation was still there and the aftertaste did not go away quickly. The rest of the drink went down the sink drain....it was definitely not my cup of ""tea""."
45728,B0041NYV8E,A3EWUMHYMPD7IB,1/31/12,0,0,2,Year of the Dragon Beverage,"The sample packet I received of the ginger/lemon/honey granules had very simple instructions on it (in 3 languages) which simply said to pour the packet contents into a cup, add boiling water, and stir.<br /><br />It didn't specify how big a cup, but knowing the power of ginger I pulled out a 16 ounce megacup just in case 12 ounces of water wasn't enough to dilute it to a tolerable state.<br /><br />Good thing I did, as I kept adding more boiled water, stirring, and tasting, until the megacup was within a half inch of the top. Still the liquid was a deep color resembling strong black tea with honey and lemon added (rendering a cloudy look.)<br /><br />The ginger was frankly harsh, no matter that I diluted it beyond normal cup size, nor how much I let it cool. Certainly it was sweet enough, and the lemon flavor was detectable.<br /><br />However, after swallowing just a couple of ounces my mouth and entire esophagus developed a burning sensation that didn't subside for more than half an hour. That's when the irony occurred to me that we're in the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese calendar, and I felt that I had just breathed fire.<br /><br />Now, I happen to like most commercial lemon/ginger teas, especially the one from Bigelow, with the Probiotics. I add my own honey - just a teaspoonful, and my husband and I enjoy a cup often before bedtime for a good night's sleep. I was hoping this product would be equally as enjoyable as the Bigelow and without the mess of the honeypot, but apparently not.

All you have to do is pour hot water over the contents and serve. I split it with my daughter to get her input on flavor,and neither of liked the flavor at all. We both love ginger and lemon, and can even handle strong tea brewed from fresh ginger. It had a strange medicinal flavor, and was sweetened somehow, but the package had no ingredient list and no other information whatsoever. The lack of information with the sample had me considering tossing it into the trash since I always like to know exactly what I'm using. Without information, I decided to base my rating on taste alone. The lemon was mild, and I assume the sweetener was honey. It wasn't too sweet, nor was the ginger too strong, but that outstanding medicine/fake taste was overwhelming. It did dissolve easily, and it's nice not to have a tea bag to deal with, but not worth it when it tastes so bad. If you like ginger for its health benefits, take a piece of fresh ginger, cut it into a few pieces, and boil in a pan to desired taste. Add lemon and honey also to taste and you're set."

The first thing I noted was that when you mix the product with hot water, according to the package directions, the powder does not completely dissolve. Secondly, the product was overly sweet for me. The sample I received to review was the actual packet so I don't know what information is given on the box the packets come in. However, the packet gives no information on the ingredients other than lemon and ginger. The listing states that honey is used as a sweetener. There's no other apparent information as to any other possible ingredients, though. Disappointedly, this product didn't even make it to first base for me."

It was mainly the overpowering favor of ginger and a sweetener, which the web page describes as honey. Honey or not I really couldn't tell.  I love ginger as spice in food preparation but I can't say that I like this beverage. It has an unpleasant bitter aftertaste, typical of ginger roots. The product description seems to suggest that the drink has some medicinal power; perhaps that's why it tastes like medicine.  I didn't finish my cup. It is not for me."

The packet directions stated to mix the entire package with 250ml of water, or approximately 8.45 oz.  I used hot water and mixed up the drink.  I was a little nervous to try it, as it looked like muddy river water. The first sip wasn't so bad.  The lemon taste was nice, and not artificial tasting.  The ginger taste was ok at first, but left a ""hot"" after taste in my mouth.  The drink was very strong, so I poured the drink back into the water bottle that I had gotten the water out of, to ""water it down"" so that it wouldn't be so strong.  That improved it slightly, but the after taste of the ginger was still too hot for my taste.  Finally, I decided to put the bottle into the fridge to see if I would like it better cold.  Two hours later I pulled it out and shook it up (It still looked like river water to me)  and took a drink.  This time, the lemon flavor, which had been pleasant before, was completely overpowered by the ginger taste, which seemed to be even more ""hot"" and lasting than before.<br /><br />Needless to say, I did not finish the bottle, and I have no intention of buying more of this.  I felt that the lemon flavor was nice, and perhaps a ""plain"" lemon drink would be fine, but the ginger in this beverage was far to spicy for my taste.  I have no idea if this beverage would be beneficial for those suffering with nausea, because I was unable to finish one package.  In my opinion, it would only aggreavate the stomach of someone who is already feeling ill."
45751,B0041NYV8E,ADX9NTN40T1HN,1/25/12,0,0,2,Not what I had hoped for!,"Received my bag and tried it hot.  After all, January is National Hot Tea Month!<br /><br />Not enough lemon and too much ginger.  I didn't want to add more sugar since I'm diabetic, maybe that would have helped the bitterness go away?<br /><br />This isn't a tea I'll be purchasing."
45755,B0041NYV8E,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,1/24/12,0,0,2,Overpowering ginger,"The instructions on the packet say to pour hot water over the drink mix but it doesn't mention the amount. I used a typical coffee mug size cup full of hot water and poured it over the mix in a separate cup. The ginger odor is highly evident the minute you open the packet. The mix dissolves immediately as soon as the water hits it. The drink itself was way too powerful for me to drink. The ginger was overpowering and it burned my throat. I think the drink might be better with less mix but as the instructions were rather vague, I wasn't sure how to use it. Like many of the other reviewers, I did not detect the lemon flavor."

I thought the aroma was very pleasant and enjoyable. As for taste, you don't notice the lemon, but the ginger is very strong and packs a very strong spicy bite! If you love ginger, you will enjoy this drink, but if you dislike the taste of even a ginger snap cookie, steer clear.<br /><br />Although I liked this drink, I was disappointed with the nutritional information. Although it's all natural, 1 sachet equals 73 calories and contains 16 grams of sugar! That's a lot for a cup of tea! I'll stick with either Tazo Green Ginger Tea or The Mate Factor's Yerba Mate lemon ginger. You still get that ginger flavor without the added calories and sugar!"

I am a hot tea aficionado, but this mix was god-awful. I added it to water both hot and cold. It made everything taste like medicine. My wife refused to drink it at all, so repelled was she by the chemical odor. Although I generally like a lemon flavor, and use ginger in cooking, this combination as presented by Gold Kili is not meant for human consumption."
45763,B0041NYV8E,A21B8AV7E3MPXE,4/18/12,3,5,2,It was alright,"I figured I wanted to try something new, so I would give this a whirl.  It was alright,  but no better than the Lipton tea packets.  I would go for whichever was cheaper or on sale in the future.  I feel the same about both."
45764,B0041NYV8E,A3EEHMLILVOEMJ,1/27/12,3,5,2,Whoa!  Too strong for me!,"I enjoy tea.  I enjoy ginger-- ginger bread, ginger cookies, ginger in certain food recipes.  I've heard it has alot of nutritional benefits.  So I thought I'd give this tea a try.  The instructions say to mix it with 250 mL of hot water.  I followed the instructions exactly.  Took a sip.  WHOA!!!!  Really, really strong!  I waited it to cool a bit, thinking maybe the hot temperature was affecting my opinion.  When it was warm (not cold), I tried again.  Still too much.  So I added water.  Still too strong.  Added more water.  Nope.  It got to the point that I just gave up.  I didn't like the flavor, and I didn't like the intensity. I'm sure there are those who are experienced ginger tea drinkers who might like this, but I won't be joining them."
45765,B0041NYV8E,ALQMZVXPJ0Y3A,1/25/12,3,5,2,too strong!!,"The ginger in this product is just too strong - it cancels out any of the lemon flavoring.  Thanks for the sample, but no dice."
45766,B0041NYV8E,A1DG75OT3Y49EM,4/24/12,1,2,2,Not For Me,"Ginger, honey and lemon are all good for you and taste good... just not so much together.<br /><br />To drink you pour the individual package into a cup and fill with appx 8.5 ounces (250 ml). The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the amazingly strong ginger fragrance - it was so strong it was off-putting. I got my first whiff of lemon once I added the water. After stirring it up the fragrance mellowed a bit.<br /><br />The first sip was reminiscent of when I was on a juicing fast (fruits and veggies only) when I used Ginger in a drink recipe that I read online. It was strong and had a terrible after taste. This was exactly that. At first you can taste the lemon, and then you get the spicy kick all the way down your throat. I tried a few more sips to see if I could acclimate my taste buds but I just couldn't hack this. I'm just not good with ginger in my drinks.<br /><br />If you want something spicy (and especially ginger) and you enjoy flavors from the Far East you may enjoy this drink. It's natural and the ingredients are good for you. It just wasn't for me."
45772,B0041NYV8E,AV1F8VNJPLPTL,4/17/12,1,2,2,Very powerful ginger flavor,"The Gold Kili flavor is very powerful raw ginger with a little lemon and some spices.  I love ginger, and it's a little much for me.  The color and consistency in the packet is like a brown Tang.  The color of the beverage is a cloudy medium-brown.<br /><br />If you don't mind occasionally eating raw ginger, the Gold Kili may be a perfect drink for you.  For others, it's likely the flavor is too strong to be pleasant.  However, you can of course just dilute with more water until the flavor intensity matches your preferences.<br /><br />Based on packet instructions, I would have to rank this item as two stars...""I don't like it."""
45775,B0041NYV8E,ASLHDTUUMOH7F,4/16/12,1,2,2,"Not For Me, thank you!","First, being the age that I am, I certainly do remember my father making ginger ""tea"" and putting lemon in it with sugar (actually, he used molasses) and drinking it warm. As a child I thought this simply weird and dreadful!<br /><br />Later, with maturity, etc., I came to like this as a warm beverage on cold rainy wintery type days, etc. I use my dad's ""molasses"" frequently in many things because of its nutritional properties, and sometimes I use honey, but seldom refined sugars.<br /><br />I ordered this product from Vine to try out, and was surprised when only one packet arrived in a very large box, making me think I was getting a decent sized trial sampling. Of little consequence, however, as after some really heavy searching and investigating online, I finally found the list of ingredients. This list is posted below for your inspection and consideration.<br /><br />My father had it right, and nutritionally better, also. I found this to be very intensely sweet as I use very little sweetener of any kind anyway, so that was my first impression...too sticky sweet. Further tasting in my tongue, pallet, and upper throat found the gingery flavor ""not quite right"" like it was old or off somehow. Again, probably not too surprising as this is a powdered mix and flavor and texture loss are to be expected I would guess.<br /><br />After reading the ingredients with my searching I naturally made the immediate decision to stick with my dad's ""old way"" and feeling really good about it.<br /><br />I would urge you to make up your own at home like I do vs this excessively sugary and flat tasting concoction imported from Singapore. It just seems so crazy to go this route when you can be drinking something made fresh, and with better ingredients, yourself!<br /><br />The information from their website (after I was able to find them) are:<br /><br />[Instant Ginger Lemon Drink<br />Code: 1935 (10 sachets per box)<br /><br />Ingredients: Ginger, Glucose, Sucrose, Honey, Fructose and Natural Lemon Flavour<br /><br />Instant Ginger Lemon Drink is made from top grade fresh ginger, honey and lemon. Modern and hygienic manufacturing techniques are used to preserve the natural taste, goodness and fragrance.

45777,B0041NYV8E,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,4/5/12,1,2,2,Ever want to drink a ginger root? Here's your chance.,"Ginger isn't the kind of thing that I eat regularly, or in big doses when I do, but I like the flavor. After one sip of this drink mixture though, I think I'm good for the rest of the year. The thing is, I knew I was in for trouble as soon as I opened the packet and saw just how much power came out of it. You'd think that one packet is meant for an entire gallon and not just a little over one cup.<br /><br />Making the drink is simple- add the packet's contents to a cup, add hot water and drink it when you're ready. The smell is great, and I couldn't wait to try it out. Good god is the flavor bold. I only suggest buying this drink if you REALLY love ginger. I mean...if you go crazy like Taz when someone even mutters the word, then you will probably like this stuff. I could barely detect any hint of lemon, the other flavor featured, because the ginger sucker punches you in the mouth relentlessly. Take a big ginger root, blend it, and that's how this tastes.<br /><br />Even now, 5 hours after trying it out, I can still taste it. And this is after having eaten dinner and lots of water and milk. 'definitely won't be giving this another shot."
45779,B0041NYV8E,A29M09QBG9TZLP,3/31/12,1,2,2,An acquired taste,"I only had one packet to test of this product and I put it into a 8oz. glass of hot water. It is mostly ginger flavored with just a hint of lemon. The ginger is so strong that it actually tastes a bit like sweetened pepper and it leaves a kind of nasty taste in your mouth after it goes down. Perhaps, it might be better if you only added a bit of the packet to tea, or only used a bit of the packet in the water because, the ginger is very overwhelming. I was hoping for more lemon flavoring to balence out the ginger. This probably is good to settle the stomach, IF you can stomach the flavor....so this won't be a product that I'd use again."
45780,B0041NYV8E,A13U975DFXBU44,3/26/12,1,2,2,Odd aftertaste is the deal-breaker,"I really don't know what to compare with this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon drink, which will adequately describe the flavor profile I'm getting when tried at full strength per the package directions.  The aftertaste of cough drops, perhaps, or that chemical/sodium taste you get as a minor note with club soda, only -- unfortunately -- amplified.<br /><br />Dry ginger granules can't really be expected to taste ""fresh"" - and indeed the Gold Kili ginger calls to mind the kind you'd buy to make pumpkin pie.  Now, I expect I've savored plenty of chai teas that had ginger powder in the spice base.  So after determining that full-strength Gold Kili was too strong for me, I decided to try it as a drink add-in, mixing it with a quart of tea from the fridge.  It wasn't bad...except for that chemical aftertaste again.  Rats.<br /><br />1.5 stars, rounded up -- recognizing the convenience of the product and the fact that tastes do vary."
45785,B0041NYV8E,A4VMQ6ZTSXSSL,2/22/12,1,2,2,My co-workers made me leave the breakroom.,"The smell of ginger is so overpowering that several of my co-workers walked in the break room and said, ""yuck, what's that smell?"" I drank it warm and it definitely burns the throat with the strong ginger taste.  The aftertaste is what was the worst, it tasted like old lemons. I love Moscow Mule's and Ginger Beer but just couldn't handle this, it was just too strong, both in taste and smell.  You'd better be a ginger lover, that's most definite."
45803,B0041NYV8E,A2AYYKD4OODSLY,4/18/12,2,4,2,Unique flavor,"This tastes like sweetened lemonade that has been heated up and heavily doused with ginger.  There is more sweetness than tartness to the lemon portion, and the ginger is very strong.  It makes your whole mouth and throat tingle.  I really was not impressed with this hot drink.  I'd much rather drink an herbal lemon tea or  ginger tea, but not this.  I couldn't even finish the cup, and no one else in the family would try it either.  The combination of its muddy tan color and its smell turned them off.  On a positive note, the powder completely and quickly dissolved in the hot water."
45804,B0041NYV8E,A3T5NSG7LMRY0A,4/18/12,2,4,2,This just wasn't for me...,"It seemed easy enough to make. Basically just dump the little granules in a cup and add hot water. Stir to dissolve it. Then attempt to drink...<br /><br />Not sure what I was expecting. Maybe something like tea or like lemonade. It was neither. It was lemony, sure, but it was also really spicy. Like 'hot' spicy. A bit like drinking chili pepper water.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea, as it were. If you really like drinking spicy ginger, perhaps you'll like this. Guess I'm not much of a ginger fan...?<br /><br />For me, I'll stick with green tea or peppermint. This just didn't sit well with me."
45811,B0041NYV8E,A1PYNMASUM1MD8,1/23/12,2,4,2,Not Impressed!,"First, this product package is about the size of a Cool Aid package, approximately 2"" x 3"". It comes in a sealing foil package similar to Cool Aid. I ordered this through the Vine program and to my amazement, this small package of powdered drink mix came in a box big enough for 20 books! It came in a 19"" x 14"" box, stuffed full of protective air bubbles. While I appreciate good packaging, the waste here completely turned me off! It was incredible. The product itself was so-so. Not terrible, but not really good either. It is definitely not something that I would replace my green tea or peppermint tea with during the day, so I don't see myself drinking it or desiring it. If you something a bit different, you may want to give it a try. But I was not very impressed with either the taste or the waste associated with this product and will not be using it again."
45817,B0041NYV8E,A31VDZOEJACIHH,5/9/12,0,1,2,The ginger-honey crystals tea is better,"After being in Tibet, I fell involve love with the Ginger-Lemon-honey tea, so was happy to buy a simpler way to make it.<br />I usually buy this product: ""Ginger Honey Crystals Instant Tea 10 Bags by Prince Of Peace"" but decided to try another one.<br /><br />This version is More bitter and has Darker color (of the tea). you can easily make 2 cups of tea from opt he content of one bag.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to the other one..."

45823,B0041NYV8E,AEC90GPFKLAAW,3/28/12,1,1,2,"Mediciney taste, bad aftertaste","I got a sample serving of this tea from the Amazon Vine program, free in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />I'm a big tea drinker and enjoy ginger and lemon I thought I'd enjoy this product.  I poured the granules in to my (large) cup and added two cups of boiling water.  The smell was overpoweringly gingery, and I hoped it didn't taste like it smelled.  I took two sips of this tea and shivered from the horrible taste.  I love ginger but this was way too strong - I would have had the same effect if I'd stirred a tablespoon of ginger powder into hot water.  I didn't taste any lemon at all, and it was also too sweet.  I added a little ice to cool it down and tried again.  Nope, still noxious.  I poured it down the drain, and fixed some mint tea to counteract the aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />This vile concoction tastes like an experiment gone wrong.  I won't be buying it, ever."
45837,B0041NYV8E,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,4/16/12,0,1,2,Interesting But Too Spicy,"I must say I was excited to try this product because it sounded like a unique and tasty combination of flavors, but it didn't quite live up to what I had hoped for.  I enjoy the flavor of ginger as well as lemon by themselves but had never put the two together, although it makes sense if it's made right because they can balance each other with the right combination of quantities, a mix of bitter, sweet and sour.  The flavor of the ginger in this instance definitely over-powered the lemon and was just altogether way too potent for my taste buds.  This may be to the liking of those who like or can handle really spicy foods but this disagreed with my sensibility.  I measured it right with 250 ml of water (about an 8 oz. cup) and I tried it both hot and cold but it was too powerful either way.  Now if they greatly reduced the amount of ginger and focused on the lemon with just a hint of ginger, they'd be onto something, but as it stands it's quite simply too strong.  The amount of lemon was just fine but someone dropped the ball when mixing it with ginger.  I like the concept but it needs more work before it's perfected."
45845,B0041NYV8E,A2WY52YD5GAEIB,4/12/12,0,1,2,"Too much ginger, weird aftertaste","Normally, I love ginger, honey and lemon in drinks.  Unfortunately, I found the ginger in this drink overpowered the taste of the lemon and honey.  I also felt like it was not a true ginger flavor, seemed somewhat artificial, which is probably where the odd aftertaste came from.  Can't quite explain the aftertaste, but it did seem almost chemical.  Not a drink I would purchase."
45849,B0041NYV8E,A1WXJ1I42UOQ2V,4/11/12,0,1,2,Spicy Hot...,"This drink has too much ginger for my taste.  I like ginger just not this much in one drink.  I tried to improve the taste by adding honey and that helped but not enough for me to be able to drink it.  10 minutes after taking a few sips my tongue was still burning from the spices, not the heat.  More lemon might have helped the flavor a bit but the ginger is quite strong."
45851,B0041NYV8E,A1W78VPTNJJOF0,4/10/12,0,1,2,Maybe for someone else,"Coffee, tea, and other hot drinks can be pretty subjective. So, some people may love it. I didn't really like this. I was expecting lemon and ginger. It tasted a lot more like cloves to me. On the other hand, I do believe that my stomach was a little happier after drinking it. I am just not sure it was worth it.<br /><br />This was easy to mix-Just put it in hot water and it all quickly mixed."
45854,B0041NYV8E,A2OWR5G2OAQF7C,4/8/12,0,1,2,Sweet tasting,"Personally, it tasted too sweet and you could not taste the ginger or the lemon.  For a convenience point of view, this might work for some people; but if you really want the health benefit of a cleasne from a lemon and ginger: get the real mccoy."

Based on the warm golden liquid featured in the mug on the box I was actually surprised that the actual color is a deep opaque brown with an extremely pungent smell.<br /><br />As for taste it is sweet yet quite strong. Tho' the taste was not altogether unpleasant my tongue and my throat were burned. Not as in the liquid was too hot but as in it was too spicy for me.<br /><br />People who win chili contests would probably find this refreshing."
45869,B0041NYV8E,A12ENBT314RFXR,3/14/12,0,1,2,Overpowering ginger flavor,"The ginger flavor in this drink is so overpowering that I could not get past two drinks. The first drink was when the beverage was hot and I thought that maybe the heat had made the ginger flavor really stand out. I let it cool down quite a bit and took another drink, but it was the same too-strong ginger flavor.<br />I really wanted to enjoy this product, and I expected to because I like ginger jelly and candies. This was over the top in my opinion."

I was sorely disappointed.  I could hardly taste any lemon flavor, and even the ginger wasn't as strong as what I had hoped for.  I'll keep drinking the plain ginger, but (for me at least) the ginger and lemon falls flat."

Maybe I'll make some tonight or last week about 8pm to warm myself up.  Sounded good.<br /><br />I turned over the package to see how much hot water to add and this is what the package says ""for hot serving: Pour contents, add hot water (250ml) stir and serve instantly.""  I'm not in Europe or Mexico.  Who in the heck in the US cooks by ml's?  I'm assuming its milliliters?  If I hadn't had the internet I wouldn't have known to add a cup of hot water to the powder.<br /><br />Ok, smells nice but a little spicy, take a sip and whew it knocked my head off.  It wasn't spicy like hot pepper spicy but like 180 proof spicy and it burned my throat all the way down.  Can't say that this has any proof liquor in it and it does smell like lemons a little but can't tell you exactly what it does taste like.<br /><br />Would I get it again?  Heck NO.  This stuff was beyond nasty and I can eat or drink just about anything.  But, just to give it the benefit of the doubt I refrigerated it and tasted it the following morning.  Still nasty.<br /><br />And another thing, I'm not really sure if it is caffeine free or not since I didn't go to sleep until 3:30 that am."

Having to only add hot water definitely saves a lot of effort of tracking down the ingredients and time to actually peeling the ginger, squeezing the lemon, etc.<br /><br />I have tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C"">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and found those to be very heavy on the ginger. Comparatively, Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage, which similarly comes packaged in a bag and needs to be mixed with water, doesn't taste overwhelmingly gingery.<br /><br />However, the Gold Kili product tastes incredibly sugary. It's the kind of drink that gets worse the more you try it. The first sip seems acceptable, the second seems iffy, and then before you know it, your body decided that it's a bit more sugar than you bargained for. I appreciate the fact that it's caffeine-free, but must it be overwhelmingly sweet to block the taste of ginger?"

I am mad about ginger, and I crave spicy foods that burn my mouth for hours, so I enjoyed this beverage, once. All this said, I didn't love it, and I won't buy it. The ginger is overpowering, even for me, almost completely masking the light lemon and honey taste.<br /><br />If you are craving a rich, sweet drink to warm you up, this is not it. If you don't enjoy mouth-burning delicacies, this is not for you! However, ginger is very therapeutic for certain health conditions, so this may be a more appropriate use for this product."

I should have been more skeptical of this powdered concoction.<br /><br />When I poured the hot water into my mug, the gingery smell hit me in the face and I was excited. My first couple of sips seemed to confirm what my nose had anticipated: a delicious, pungent, gingery punch. The ginger really is IN-YOUR-FACE, like a good ginger beer, which I happen to love. It's hot on the tongue and has a nice bite in the back of your throat. Honestly, that's how ginger tea, ginger beer, or ginger anything is SUPPOSED to taste. It may be a bit strong for some people, but those people probably don't really like ginger. It's actually a little sweet for my tastes, but not so much that it was a problem for me. My initial thought was that I really liked it.<br /><br />As I kept sipping, though, that sweetness grew, and eventually started to taste... funny. Now, more than half way through my mug, I have a strange, lingering after taste in my mouth that is not very pleasant. I don't know what's in this stuff, but I suspect saccharine, Stevia, aspartame, or some other artificial sweetener... the after taste is almost reminiscent of bubble gum, but not in a good way. I'm not getting so much ginger flavor anymore, only its hotness.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish my mug. But I wonder if maybe it's just me. My girlfriend comes home and I hand her the still warm mug and say ""here, Ginger tea!"" She sips once. Seems pleased. She sips again a few moments later. Seems to hesitate. By the third sip, she looks at the mug, then looks at me, ""I don't think I like this"". Down the drain it went."

Having dealt with nausea due to chemo I was hoping it would help with it.  It might would help, but I couldn't get past the taste.....it was very spicy in that it burned my throat.  I used the whole packet in a large mug of hot water.....I may have mixed it too strong or it may be supposed to taste rather spicy.  I'm not familiar with ginger so I really don't know.  I just didn't care for the taste of this product, but I would like to try other of their herbal teas."
45927,B0041NYV8E,A3LXXYBYUHZWS5,1/25/12,2,3,2,Not for me,"I love drinking hot tea and some of my favorites have lots of lemon. Figuring the ginger would be an interesting addition I thought I would give this a try. The drink dissolved completely into a dark yellow brew but the ginger flavor was way to powerful and I couldn't taste any lemon at all. I used 8 oz of water and when that was too strong I watered it down but that did nothing to diminish the ginger. In fact the tea even had a ""hot"" taste as if there was chili in it. I'll pass on this one."

In all my years of consuming grated ginger, powdered ginger, ginger ale, ginger beer, candied ginger and a favorite when I have a writing project due, chocolate dipped ginger... none of it has ever tasted bitter. Just hot and spicy. A tiny bit citrusy. But clean and mouth tingling.<br /><br />Not this. It is a powder in a foil packet. I boiled fresh filtered water in a clean kettle and poured it into a clean mug. I could taste the ginger and the lemon flavor... then a very bitter aftertaste. Old, gone around the bend, wheat paste flavor. If I was sick with a very bad cold it would serve the purpose to clean my head out... but if you have access to a fridge at all - get a jar of grated ginger and a bottle of lemon juice and mix your own. A teaspoon of honey, teaspoon bottled grated ginger and teaspoon lemon juice with 8 oz. boiling water and you'll feel just like new. Or pour boiling water over a few slices of fresh ginger and a fresh-squeezed lemon wedge and let it seep 5 minutes -- but I have trouble with fresh lemons shriveling in the crisper drawer before I use them.<br /><br />This powder would be good to put in your carry-on luggage to clear your head on a long trip. But I think I actually prefer ... trade secret here ... lemon-flavored Gatorade made with hot water. I think will actually prevent a cold if you drink two cups the minute your throat gets itchy.<br /><br />Oh! Ginger is also good for digestion. Again - I'd prefer a spoon of fresh grated in a tub of yogurt to this powder - but this powder would help if you were traveling.<br /><br />Good luck! May you never need to know what hot Gatorade tastes like!"

When the time came, and I was in a kitchen with nothing but water to drink, I tried it. It tasted, mostly, as you might expect: a kick of ginger and tang of lemon.<br /><br />Then the ""honey"" kicks in. And by ""honey"" I mean that's what the Ingredients say--but they also list to of those -ose sugars. Result is an artificial taste. You could put ginger, honey, and lemon in hot water a million times and not come up with that artificial taste.<br /><br />Because of the aftertaste, I won't be buying any of this. It's ultimately gross."

If you like to munch on ginger in your spare time, this is a drink for you. The ginger taste is overbearing and overpowering, and the only hint of lemon I got was a sourness in the aftertaste.<br /><br />Speaking of, the aftertaste so strong, as strong as but distinct from the main taste, that I ended up throwing half my glass down the drain. I've drank some odd things in my day (passion fruit and aloe juice, for instance), but I just couldn't tolerate this. And, just for good measure, the package was a bear to open for me.<br /><br />On the plus side, the mix is some nice yellowish pellets (about the size of the wax ball you see on new pens sometimes) that dissolve quickly and cleanly in hot water. But when the best thing I have to say about a drink is how nicely the mix dissolves, something's not right."

All I can say is YUK! The ginger is so over powering, that I couldn't taste any lemon or honey. There was kind of a rancid taste to it, and it leaves a horrible after taste. I was thinking about trying to doctor it up with more lemon and honey, but the smell literally got me sick, so I dumped it out."

Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE"">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>."

The ""Organic Premium"" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better."
46060,B001EO5QZK,A2R4BNNO98V4A2,12/18/07,3,3,2,This is not premium quality tea,"I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green."

I know if this was just a bad bag I got but when I gave them the bones again a week later the same thing happened.  They really like the bones though and they don't smell too bad, so if your dog has an iron stomach go for it."

But I could immediately see without opening a bag that the bones were not the advertised size.  The real size range was 5 to 5-1/2 inches (to confirm my visual estimation, I grabbed my tape measure and measured their lengths).  Not ONE single bone was 7, or 6-1/2, or 6 inches.<br /><br />When you have a large dog, the size of their dog chews determines how long they will last.  I hate being lied to - no matter what a ""deal"" this product may be for others.<br /><br />If you want true-to-size 7"" rawhide bones, get ""Healthy Hide"" brand beefhide treats.  They're made from free-range, grass-fed beef, and are HACCP & ISO certified.  And you also won't be ripped-off by deceptive marketing."

The ingredients seemed great, but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5-7 times per day! The food did little to help with weight reduction (even with all the vomiting), and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian-prescribed food instead. (Note: Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem.) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food, his stool has become firmer and less frequent, and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis.<br /><br />As I stated above, the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious, but I would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else."

Rice noodles being as bland as they are, I expected a much more flavorful soup. What little flavor I could make out in the soup wasn't good, and didn't fit the description. (If ""Chinese Onion Flavor"" means something significantly different than ""onion flavor,"" ignore me.) I would not have connected this to onions unless I had read it on the package. I'm not sure how to describe the little taste that's in it. It tastes bad."

There was no labeling at all on the bag or in the box. If you are like me you like to know the product information especially country of origin, preparation method, and manufacturer.  The HPD information states that these sticks come from free-roaming bulls, but, who knows what I received. The smell of the product is sickly sweet and fairly pungent.<br /><br />What was most disappointing though was the size of the sticks. An average size is about 1/2 inch in parameter. Many are around 1/4 inch.  Only a few are close to 1 inch.<br /><br />My cocker spaniel plowed through one of these sticks in about five minutes.  Hardly the distraction that I intended.<br /><br />Typically I purchase Cadet 12"" bully sticks, cutting them down to 4 inch sticks.  Cadet sticks are wide, have very little smell and contain product information. My dog takes about 30 minutes with these. Going forward I will order the Cadets."

Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok, the color a little pale, but all that aside, the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried."

Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as ""PB2"" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again)."

I do not care for the taste of this one, though.  The flavoring seems more like coconut than caramel and it is a thinner consistency than the other drinks with milk pods that I've tried.  I would not purchase it again."

Its the lack of integrity that concerned me.  If the price of something is going to increase, state it.  Don't lower the quantity and keep the price the same.  It is a insult to our intelligence.  I called dreamfields and was told that most consumers aren't as aware as i am.  Wel. AMERICA, BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU BUY.  That is a 2.5 oz difference.  Out of 16, that is a lot.  Buy something else.  If a company can decide that i would be stupid enough to not notice, well, guess what, i did.  Now, they lost a customer because of their corporate Greed."

When you do the math on this product, it comes out to $4.78 each.  That is way higher than what I can pay for at a store.  Very disappointed in Amazon's pricing for this product!"

She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

The bag lists 9 different bars, but most of them were Nestle Crunch (100 out of 150 of the pieces).  We got very few of some of the other varieties, and we got ZERO Kit Kats, as were supposed to be included.  Also, the weight of the bag is 5 pounds.  Many of the candy bars were squashed."

Planters are much cheaper (about $7/lb base price, compared to about $8.75/lb from my usual site). They were also smaller. Since they were only advertised as ""whole"" I guess the size would not be a mischaracterization. However, many of the nuts were broken, so the description of ""whole"" was certainly  a mischaracterization.  They are more lightly salted than most nuts we are used to in the US.  Lower sodium intake is a worthy health goal, but not my personal taste preference, whether or not the salt is ""sea"". All-in-all  the  ""deluxe""  description seems quite a stretch<br /><br />Bottom line, a good buy if price is the overriding goal."

Maybe they got broken in shipping? Also, the whole nuts seem smaller than the whole roasted cashews that Costco sells for about the same price. Finally, the Planters cashews are noticably saltier than the Costco cashews. I'm not opposed to salt for health reasons, but that much salt does mask the natural taste of the nuts (and taste is why I bought cashews instead of peanuts)."

I prefer a whole nut for the price.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars for the price but 1 star for the quality of the product delivered."

Even today I don't like them.  An overbearingly strong sour and sugary taste is the reason why.  Plus artificial fruit put in milk just isn't a winning combination by any stretch of the imagination.  I'm not a picky cereal eater, but these just aren't very appealing to me.  Maybe you'll like them but me?  No way!"
47405,B0019GVBYI,A16DQCJYM2GN9A,9/8/12,1,1,2,Not as fresh as expected,I was quite disappointed in the lack of freshness of the Bilberry Tea. It has a stale flavor that I've not encountered in other Bilberry Teas.

I picked some of these up in the U.S. since the shape and basic ingredients are similar to a well loved Canadian Dad's cookie. They just don't even compare to Canada's Dad's Goodie Rings made by Kraft Foods. If you are a fan of this cookie and get the opportunity to pick up a pack of Dad's Goodie Rings in Canada, you will probably love them."

I did recently try Dreyer's Samoa ice cream which was awesome, but even that has disappeared from the store freezers. I think that was a Limited Edition flavor. Anyway, when someone advised me Keebler has come out with a version, I had to try them.<br /><br />Maybe it's unfair to compare the two cookies, but hey, they look exacted the same. These cookies aren't horrible, but they have a bizarre crumbly almost grittiness about them that is off-putting. Maybe it's the way the coconut is roasted, I don't know, but it's unpleasant. And the fudge is waxy. The other thing I noticed was peanuts was listed in the ingredients. I am allergie to peanuts, and I had eaten two of these before I realized it. But that was yesterday, and I haven't had a reaction. I'm not going to blame Keebler for this. I should have read the box first. But beware. These are cheaper than Samoas, I'll give them that."

I had very disappointing luck with this one.  I  read the instructions and followed them clearly, paying particular attention to keeping the soil moist and warm and the light dim until germination. I used an 8-inch garden pot and the same Miracle Grow potting soil that had worked wonders in my outdoor garden pots.  But the results were disappointing.  All I got were a scattered few strands of grass.  A  second attempt, using more seeds and a different, smaller pot netted the same meager results.<br /><br />Meanwhile my other purchase, the Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit--which came with similar instructions, but  its own soil, disposable planter pouch and far fewer seeds at twice the price--produced a veritable thicket of grass that kept  growing and growing and, despite daily grazings from three cats,  lasted  five full weeks.<br /><br />I still have some Nibble-Licious seeds left, so would gladly appreciate comments from those of you who've had good results with  this product on what you did right that I may have done wrong and how to fix it.<br /><br />\<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006348H2"">Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit</a>"

As if chicken wings already don't have enough flavor.  This sauce is terrible out of the bottle --  sure, it's mild -  not tangy at all, and so salty that it's just disgusting.  I ended up more than doubling the volume just to reduce the sodium content to a reasonable level -  added some apple cider vinegar, water, brown sugar, a couple tablespoons of honey - a little cornstarch as a thickener and cooked it up on the stove.  They should be selling the sauce I made because it's three times better than this stuff."

Since I can't get fresh coconut water where I live I order it from Amazon all the time...every few weeks or so.  My wife thought I was crazy at first, but she came to acquire a taste for coconut water and so I order some for her as well.  I loved the zico in the 11oz cartons.  I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their ""new"" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.

Like other reviewers, I like the flavor of Zico natural coconut water available in the traditional packaging. A look at the nutrition information on the label makes it clear that there is a difference in the two products, though I haven't analyzed the changes.

I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.<br /><br />I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8SO10"">Naked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.

I asked my mom why it smells so off, but she says that's how it's supposed to smell, which is funny because I remember when I used to drink coconut water out of the coconut it didn't smell so weird.<br />Second, I don't know if I ruined my taste buds by drinking ginger ale, but this does NOT taste like coconut water! I'll update my review in another, but honestly, I don't think I'm gonna grow to like this. I'm truly disappointed :/"

Though I understand that pina coladas are made with coconut MILK and not coconut juice, I thought there would be some parallels.<br />First of all, this drink has a strange salty flavor. Secondly, it's not sweet. It SMELLS sweet and pineapple-y, but the flavors just don't coordinate with each other and don't match the smell."
48232,B004SRH2B6,A2EPAANBU7FP4D,6/22/11,0,12,2,Price is absurd.,This is the basically the cheapest form to buy any of the three popular coconut water. I did the math and to put the cost in retrospective it comes to $10 per 2 liters of this coconut water.<br />This may not register to some with no concept of themselves being ripped off. There are other things out there that are better quality and less expensive and more specific for what you are looking for. If your look for something to quench thirst I highly recommend Metromint water. If your looking for things for your natural lifestyle then find a fruit with more umph than coconut.

However, unless you have a machine to froth this up when you make it, it isn't worth the money.  Lower priced items in the stores are just as convenient.  The one thing that does make this better than the crap you buy in the grocery store though, is that you don't get that kind of bitter, caffine-like taste with this stuff.  Maybe I rated it low, but I guess we thought it would be as good as what they make in the coffee shop back home...hope this review helps.

I thought the smell was quite wonderful and was preparing to savor that first bite. Unfortunately, the taste of this cereal bar was not too pleasing. It had an artificial taste to me. However, I thought the texture was nice and the amount is perfect for a breakfast on the go. I would be willing to give their apple crisp bar a try as I may have more luck with that."

It might taste good to some, but not me. I've so far had one other brand on amazon, and a few brands in store, and I disliked this one.<br /><br />The snack bites have a few problems.<br /><br />1) They're fairly watery. Not only do they look more ""reconstituted"" than other brands, but their water content seems higher.<br /><br />2) they're lacking flavor.<br /><br />I try to solve problem one and two, by cutting them in half, dosing them in some hotsauce pepper mix, and drying them in the sun [and once in the oven]. This is rather time consuming, sort of. But even then, the oil/protein ratio is higher (meaning more oil) it seems than other turkey snacks.  Which is lame.<br /><br />So, I'll keep looking for good turkey jerky on amazon [which is basically anywhere, since beef is the game in most stores], any suggestions in the comments I'd appreciate. Preferably at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />P.S, of humerus note, I noticed one of the suggested tags are ""Hip Hop"".  Funny.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got a comment that pointed out how this is not turkey jerky, but rather turkey sausage. This invalidates much of my review.

Even with shipping being a lot more than the cost of the plant itself, the overall price I thought was still a steal.  Then the plant showed up today.  Yes, it's the same kind of plant but it looks like a little baby version.  Nowhere near as big and full as the picture.  It's EXTREMELY misleading.  I would have given this one star for being so misleading instead of two, but if I hold onto the plant long enough and take care of it, someday it may look o.k.  It's a nice plant for $4.95, but I would not have paid this plus shipping to get a plant this small if I had known.<br /><br />Update - I reread the information in the plant description, and it does say the plant delivered is not pictured, so I apparantly missed that.

I inserted the treats into the sides of the ball and within half an hour my dog managed to pry the treat out of the ball and then chewed and swallowed the remaining treat.

Other than that, this product stinks. I bought it a few days ago and it finally arrived today. I put my puppy in her crate and handed her one of these treats to keep her busy while I pack. This treat was GONE in less than 10 minutes. G.O.N.E gone! Now, its not like my puppy is an aggressive chewer, she just has a strong jaw. She's also a puppy, for those people reading this who have ever had a puppy, they are easily distracted by food.<br />I looked up dog treats for aggressive chewers/strong jawed dogs and this was one of the first 5 items that appeared.I read reviews on it and everyone was crazy about how it was soo good. Now to find that I'm not finished packing, I have to go fill up her KONG to keep her from crying as she sees me running in and out of the room.

Since you can not see it, many would assume that this is just dried fruit.  It is not.  It is fruit dried with sulpher.  For some this may not be an issue (but you should know that it is there nonetheless).  I have developed sulphur allergies over the years (you develop allergies via exposure) and with more and more mass produced bulk items containing sulphur, likely many more people will too.  I have had some pretty serious health consequences of same.<br />We can get these locally very inexpensively (I am in Hawaii) and would never purchase this particular brand because of the sulphur.  I did buy it once without thinking, and they tasted bitter, acrid, nowhere near as good as we get in local shops, health food stores.  I realize that tropical fruit is not easy to get everywhere, but there are good healthy alternatives.  Consider, for example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O3C"">Woodstock Farms Mango Slices, Unsulphured, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />i was browsing here, hoping to get better prices (and access) on bulk dried fruit, but can see that the lack of labeling info is going to cause me a problem :(  I guess my only alternative until other customers specify what is on the label, is to buy things specifically labeled ""unsulphured"".<br />If you do not have allergiews or sulphur related health problems (yet) maybe consider comparing the 2.  Sulphured fruit is bitter, leaves a chemical aftertaste and is overdried making it taste a lot less fresh (which it generally is) and tougher.  In my experience, this particular product is the worst offender (at least that I have encountered).  It is heavvily sulphured and really tastes off."

I purchased the Wisconsin Cheddar, and I couldn't even eat all of one of the little bags, it was such an OD of sodium that I literally made a pucker face.  I'm not shy about salt, but these are pretty much unpalatable...and I have 15 more packs!  Maybe the other flavors don't taste as salty, but buyer beware."

I knew it would be foamy upon mixing and that it would be better aftering sitting in the fridge over night.  But even after contant mixing and being refridgerated for a couple days I can still taste a chalkiness in the tea which is just terribly off-putting.  I'll try to make some more and see if it gets better, but when compared to properly brewed-fresh tea, it's not even close.  I like a nice crisp taste to my tea, not the chalky after taste this gives."

49507,B001E5E268,A2WEQ52C7ZOGQY,3/31/07,2,5,2,Not really an Earl Grey tea,"This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.  It tastes almost sweet and more like an herbal than a black tea.  If you are looking for an Earl Grey, this certainly is not it."
49510,B001E5E268,A3DQWFWINN3V5A,10/12/10,0,2,2,Bitter Grass Clippings,"I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE"">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>."

The ""Organic Premium"" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better."
49527,B001E5E268,A2R4BNNO98V4A2,12/18/07,3,3,2,This is not premium quality tea,"I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green."

I have not had any problems with ""stale"" or ""chalky"" shipments as described by some other reviewers.<br /><br />However, I became suspicious of whether it is really ""low glycemic"" as claimed, because it tastes sweeter than one would expect for a sugar-free low-carb product. Looking more closely at the ingredients, I noticed that it contains maltitol, which is a ""sugar alcohol."" The maltitol in the product contributes 11 grams of carbs to each bar (for a total of 24 grams of carbs).<br /><br />I've read that if you're on a low-carb diet, maltitol should probably be avoided, because it is a carb, and it does have an effect on blood sugar.<br /><br />Also, maltitol can cause intestinal discomfort and/or diarrhea, if you're sensitive to it, or eat too much of it.<br /><br />I have switched to Greens+ High Protein bars (peanut butter flavor), which are fairly low glycemic for this type of product but do not have artificials sweeteners or maltitol.

In my case I received my delivery at my office and was so excited and hungry at the same time to try the bar that I neglected to even read the ingredients list thoroughly. If I had I would have seen it contained maltitol. I ate a bar and not more than five minutes later I was almost passed out at my desk. What happened you ask? A sudden and severe sugar crash caused my maltitol. For all you low-carbers and/or diabetics please be aware of this substance in this bar. Like I said not everyone has this same reaction, but the people  that do have an adverse reaction to it suffer a not so pleasant experience.<br />In hindsight it was my fault for not checking the ingredients before I clicked the purchase button.

I work out and eat pretty healthy but was trying to lean up some more but as a college student don't always have the time and resources to cook a bunch of chicken breasts. Overall, these are pretty bad. They have low sugar, and are just about the cheapest protein bars you can get, but I'm 175lbs and these just don't really satisfy any hunger, and in fact only whet my appetite and make me hungry for some real food. I think the cheap price is just not worth the bad taste, and hunger they don't fill.  If you're looking for quick convenient good tasting protein that gives you a little sometime to go on, I would go for some protein powder like Syntha 6 or something, or at least get a little more expensive, slightly more sugary but more filling and better tasting bar like Builder Bars. These can be a last resort if you're just looking to stash them around here and there in case you find yourself without something to eat but you can definitely do better. If you're going to go against my advice, I would recommend getting the peanut butter instead of the chocolate, because cheap, fake, crappy peanut butter still tastes better than cheap fake crappy chocolate, and I've had both, the chocolate is much worse. Also, pair it up with an apple or banana or something to help fill you up a little more and have at least something with some nutritional value in there."

I was very disappointed, the bars did not have any type of creamy texture that you get from peanut butter. I had issues actually swallowing a bite from the bar. I needed to drink a glass of water while I ate to even finish it. The taste of the bar was okay at best, I mean it faded after a few moments probably due to the massive amount of water it took to finish it. The bar did have little chunks of peanuts so that was pleasing but other then that it just wasn't very good.  I wanted to like this but I don't so I can't recommend this item to anyone who is just looking for a quick bite in bar form that isn't a candy variety."

First, the 2.2 oz bar itself is pretty small, especially given the fact that that little bar contains 290 calories. Second, it's pretty oily. It felt almost slippery when I opened the package. The bar itself is a block of tannish brown with small lighter chunks that are evidently cashew bits. It is firm, but soft. None of these are showstoppers for me, just different.<br /><br />However, a major difference appears when you start to eat it. Energy bars -- across the board -- are often criticized for being candy bars masquerading as nutritious. Yes, they may have good-for-you ingredients, but eating a couple of them a day delivers a LOT of calories and carbs. So I often break one in half, and have part in the morning, part in the afternoon. When I opened the Raw Revolution bar and saw how small it was, I thought, ""Oh, great, 290 is on the high end for a bar like this, and I'll want to eat the whole thing because it's so small."" Not so. to me, this was RICH. So rich, I almost had trouble eating more than a couple of bites.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is amazingly short: organic cashew, dates, agave nectar, almonds, sprouted flax seed. All ""100% raw.""<br /><br />I guess the target audience is more interested in the ingredients and preparation than in the taste. I found it okay, rather bland, but with sort of weird bitter after-taste (I think that may be the dates) and after-texture (may be the bits of sprouted flax seed suspended in the date substance). And although it isn't bad, the excessive richness of the thing keeps you from having another bite very quickly, so you just sort of sit there and ponder what's going on in your mouth, not all of which is expected, or necessarily pleasant. It's a bit sticky/chewy, but again, not in the way a bar with caramel or corn syrup would. Probably better for you than those things are, but unusual, and to me, off-putting.<br /><br />In the end, I don't think I'd buy another one of these.

Concerned that I was losing cognitive function, I went to my garbage box of non-compostable-nor-recyclables and found the wrapper from last week. I examined it carefully and it did not mention that these contain 9.4% cooked ingredients. I opened the box that had just arrived and saw that the bar labels were the same as last week: no mention of non-raw ingredients.<br /><br />Note their legal disclaimer on this site:<br /><br />""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.""<br /><br />-- They may want to add that you should also not rely on the info on their labels.<br /><br />I don't recall seeing the 90.6% figure on this site last week. I don't have evidence that they didn't have it posted here, but as you can see from this review I'm a pretty obsessive reader of info about the things I eat.<br /><br />In sum:  Their labeling is misleading about the raw content of the hazelnut chocolate bar. At the very least, given what I've experienced and what they seem to feel they need to place in their legal disclaimer, I don't believe this brand is worthy of the trust of the people I care about just yet.  I hope very much that changes, and that I can buy their products in the future. For now I'm boycotting until they are more honest in their labeling and less disingenuous in their branding.  Hopefully, eating raw will help me to live to see that day.  Godspeed, Raw Revolution."

You certainly get the dark chocolate - very strong and bitter. I knew coconut was in there from the label, and from the shreds of it I could see in the bar but I really did not taste any coconut - the chocolate flavor overpowered it completely.  The label says it contains almonds, but you don't taste that either.  I was hoping for more of a harmonious blend of both chocolate and coconut.  It certainly isn't sweet either."

It tasted just like the Beef Top Ramen Flavor I enjoyed growing up. I bought this bouillon because the packaging said NO MSG. This was important to me because I avoid MSG at all costs. I recently realized this product has yeast extract (which always contains MSG). Another review mentioned that the company recently retracted the ""NO MSG"" claim, but too little, too late. I have already consumed and gifted away most of my 12 boxes with the understanding this was an MSG-free bouillon. If you are avoiding MSG, I recommend doing some research because there are about 50 different names that can be used to hide MSG in an ingredient label. ""Yeast Extract"" is the perfect example of this. There are a lot of other names for flavor enhancers out there that always or sometimes contain MSG. Unfortunately, I did my research about a year after I purchased this product, but hopefully this review will save some other health-conscience consumer from making a purchase they regret."

However, with my last purchase a few weeks ago, I was very disappointed. When I recieved my cacao, it WAS NOT from wilderness family naturals. It was from a company I had never heard of-Organic Herbal Essence. It did not have the certified organic logo on it. When I contacted the seller, they said they ""shared"" a listing with wilderness family naturals. I have been buying from Amazon for years, and have never heard of this practice before. If it was stated up front that this was the company selling the product that would be different. I just thought I should mention this so that any other potential buyers would know what to expect when ordering this."

I bought this because I tend to ""eat clean"" for the most part and wanted a quick semi clean cheese sauce without worry of a ingredient list filled with junk (think of a dyed bright yellow clump of so called ""cheese product"") My idea was to use this as a cheese sauce for some Quinoa and broccoli, much like a cheddar cheese rice bake, sounds yummy right? Anyways when it came time to make the sauce I almost cried, it smelled like a strong soup base, (like bouillon cubes) The smell seemed to get slightly milder, but upon tasting a lick off the spoon I was more than tempted to trash the whole thing and just whip up some cheese sauce from scratch.  Instead I improvised and added about a handful of mozzarella cheese, a handful of cheddar cheese and and a half a cup of milk to the mix and while it tasted like cheddar and cardboard, my kids and I ate our dinner.  Was it worth it?  Nope, not for me at least.  Now I am sure if you NEED something like this for dietary reasons, such as having a gluten allergy or dairy allergy, then perhaps your taste buds are more ""willing"" but for me, this was a complete waste."

While the the product itself - tuna, mayo, crakers, etc - are fine, the container is unbelevably hard to open. This is  not the normal flip top can, but a ""new"" design that simply does not work. I'm a big guy, and I need a screw driver to actually open the damn thing - the lid and pull tab do not give enough torque to actually remove the lid without breaking the pull tab - or your finger. The top of the can says - in vey large letters around the pull top: ""OR USE CAN OPENER"" - but the lid is so recessed that a conventional can opener will not work, and the bottom of the can is too rounded.

I've made three boxes of it and always end up spitting out my first bite of the final product.  It also calls for a ton of eggs/oil.  It's just not good at all.  I do, however, love that it is natural.  I don't think ""natural"" should have to mean ""bland"", though.  In my opinion this needs a much stronger, richer chocolate flavor.  In my last batch I tried adding chocolate chips for some additional flavor and it did not do the trick.  Not sure what to do with the last three boxes."

I will usually buy several tins whenever I can find them, not knowing when I will find them again. I finally ran out of my supply and went looking for a refill. I was able to find them at CVS. I noticed the label said NEW GREAT TASTE.....Well, I won't exactly say YUCK, but these no longer taste like Spearmint at all. I don't know what they are using as a substitute for their original Spearmint oil, but is is a VERY POOR substitute. I now have two tins of these mints to eat. They are edible, but nothing I would buy again. Such a shame ! ! !"

Not their fault that flavor has been changed.  I assume it was a marketing decision -- not enough volume to continue the formula.  But what they decided to use instead is just a weird version of Wintergreen.  Not quite as bad (i.e. Pepto-Bismol), but nothing like the addictive Spearmint it replaced.  I could chew the old flavor like chewing jelly beans.  Now, it's just a strong breath mint like the other Altoids.  What a shame."

Even still they were stale.  If you have ever used store bought taco shells like Ortega brand.  You know that the Ortega brand comes in a white plastic shell with a plastic cover that is vacuum sealed.  I've never had a problem with broke shells or stale tasting shells with Ortega.  With the Garden of Eatin shells, however, they are stale and a lot of shells are broken.  I attribute this factor to the fact that the shells are not vacuum sealed, and there is no protection of the shells.  The taco shells are sealed inside a light plastic bag that does not even appear to be vacuum sealed-or has lost its seal.  Then they are then placed inside the box, giving lots of room to move, which, I believe, is the cause of the high amount of broken shells.<br /><br />I dont recommend these taco shells."

The box states 100% money back guarantee, however the Hodgson Mill did not send me my money back they sent me coupons for their products; products I am not sure I want to buy in advance of using them.

I was hoping this product would subtly darken my hair and also nourish it and make it softer. This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results."

What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent."

Similac Organic tastes terrible, and smells like spoiled milk when mixed. If you're wanting a quality organic formula, go with Earth's Best. My baby has terrible gas on Similac Organic, and the only reason we buy this, is when we've run out of Earth's Best and have to order more and are in a pinch. Furthermore, Similac Organic doesn't dissolve and leaves a very nasty residue on the inside of the bottle and nipple. It's gross if you ask me. I gave it more than two stars only because it's tolerable."
50903,B00139C3P2,A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84,3/11/12,2,5,2,None of the five cats will eat it,"I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning ""I hate it."" I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means ""I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that ""I don'tlike it"" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them ""eat or not eat"" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular ""orange and white kitty"" and my ""sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'"" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where ""the special eating"" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever ""speciality of the evening"" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go ""aLookin"" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid ""nose sticker uppers."" But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278"">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole ""nother"" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by ""Cindy O"". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we ""come upon"" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried."

50909,B00139C3P2,A3OT1RIV0CRKDQ,3/25/10,41,47,2,Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!,"I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice."

I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat?

In this case, the spices all came with a best used by 12/15/12 date.. 4 months only. I got.. old(er) spice.  Disappointing."

51189,B0001DQHJY,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,6/16/10,1,1,2,Stone Soup,"The Sun Bird Sweet and Sour mix packet I purchased had a recipe for sweet and sour pork on the back. I liked the idea. I also liked the relatively low sodium level for a mix. The instructions were printed in extremely small type, and I had no idea what I was getting into when I purchased the rest of the ingredients--pork, an onion, a green pepper and two carrots. I saw soy sauce, canned pineapple, catsup, cornstarch and sugar mentioned, but I always have those things on hand.<br /><br />By the time dinner was ready, I'd spend twenty minutes slicing, peeling and chopping, and had dirtied three bowls, two whisks, two measuring cups, a slotted spoon, a wooden spoon, a pair of tongs and my wok. I'd also used a LOT of cornstarch and another twenty minutes mixing the pork marinade (which called for 2 T of soy sauce, upping the sodium content considerably), mixing the sweet and sour sauce, marinating the pork, trying to brown the wet pork, removing the pork, adding the vegetables, adding the sauce back along with the pineapple, stirring frantically while the sauce was reducing and trying to judge when the sauce was thick enough. I was exhausted, the sink was full of dirty bowls and utensils and the kitchen was HOT.<br /><br />The chopping and the dirty wok go with the territory of Oriental cooking and I expected them, and I knew I'd have to make a pot of rice, but I certainly didn't expect to have to work so hard nor provide so many of the sauce ingredients to make dinner from a mix.  I wouldn't complain if the results had been spectacular, but they weren't.  Dinner was just OK. The finshed dish was bland and I added some red pepper flakes to perk it up. I must say I was disappointed both in the method and in the results. I've made sweet and sour pork from scratch before; it was only a little more work than this sauce packet recipe and the flavor was a lot better.<br /><br />It wasn't terrible, hence the two stars, but certainly not worth the time and effort.  I'll stir fry with orange juice and soy sauce before I'll use this mix again.  And in future, I'm going to read the back of packets much more carefully!"

I guess it also made my hair a little limp. But for someone with thick, wavy hair that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />My problem started a month and a half after using this. I couldn't go a full day without my hair feeling grimy and super greasy looking. Yuck! And I can't wash my hair everyday because it dries out my hair and scalp too much...On day 2, I'm afraid to be seen in public lol.<br /><br />(My hairstylist said it's from the wax they use in the conditioner to make your hair look shiny and not add volume.

At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did."

These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads.

I have to liberally apply it and still it isn't even close to as yummy as I had expected.  For example, for putting on Broccoli, it doesn't come close to beating shaking on Parmesan Cheese.  Comparing it to Cheddar flavored popcorn from Popcornopolis, it isn't even close.  With popcorn, the problem is perhaps getting it to stick, so try spray butter or something to give it something to stick to.  So maybe with level expectations, it can still be good.  It certainly isn't bad.  But I've let it sit in my cupboard for a long time without using it now.  It was a let down for me.<br /><br />One nice thing is that it seems more natural cheese flavor than some other cheese flavoring shakers, such as Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning.  The alternative probably is because others might add salt, so they have more flavor, but taste more artificial.  So this does seem the more pure cheese route."

It is stainless steel, but it's pitted and of uneven thickness. The rolled edges were done very badly and are quite uneven. And while the box is of the specified dimensions, what was not specified is that it is not true-to-shape, making the fit between the top and bottom far less than ideal. In my opinion, this box should be valued at no more than a dollar or two. I think the seller has a lot of nerve offering this as first-quality merchandise."

I really enjoyed it so asked the woman if I could see the box--I wanted to know what was in it other than rooibos. She brought the box to me and I saw that there was lemongrass in it.  That's what made it even better (for my tastebuds).<br /><br />I decided to buy the box of tea (I think there were 10 bags in the box).  When I went up to the counter, the woman told me it was $15!!!  I was shocked but had already given her my money and decided to proceed with the purchase.  When I got home I immediately went onto Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper.  Of course!!  So I bought the 100 Count box.  You're probably wondering why I'm giving this a low rating after the rave comments so far.  Here's where it gets tricky.<br /><br />The tea from the small 10-bag box was just as good as the one I had in the tea shop. However, the ones in the large quantity box just never tasted the same.  They lacked flavor, even if I steeped the bags longer.  I wonder if they're old?  I have no idea.  But I won't buy the 100 bag box again.  Sure they were way cheaper, but I'm not enjoying the tea as much.  Just drinking it to use it up and giving several bags away to friends."

Amazon has simply decided to buy the cheaper Thai version of the product, likely due to the strength of the Yen...but I would still gladly pay more to get the original thing...<br /><br />As far as the flavor goes, the Thai version tastes a different, likely due to the taste difference of Thai water vs. Japanese water.

Reluctantly I peeled one chestnut and put it into my mouth. It was stale, soggy, and a little bit sweet, far from what I had expected. I decided to give it a second chance and put the second one in my mouth. It was even worse. It was rotten and had a terrible bitter taste.

Preferably, something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger.  Well, I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag.  However, once you brew it (and I let it steep a long time) you can't even taste any of the ginger.  What happened to all the spiciness?  I don't know, but it doesn't make a good ginger tea.  Furthermore, it doesn't even taste good otherwise, as it is really bland in flavor.<br /><br />I suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea, and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but cannot stand its taste.  Personally, though, I was really let down by this tea, hence the 2-star rating.<br /><br />I discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root.  This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness, and is a whole lot cheaper.

The smell and the texture also reminded me far more of a can of beans than lentil soup.<br /><br />Now, Pret's lentil soup is also quite thick, so I'm not sure that's what puts me off. Pret's soup is indeed loaded with sodium but  I don't think that accounts for the difference in taste, as this product isn't even the low-sodium version.<br /><br />Taste, of course, is subjective, and it's clear that others like it.

I'm shocked at how many reviews are raving about this unappetizing soup. Definitely try it from the grocery store first before you get stuck with a ton of cans."

I wanted to LOVE this food because of all the great reviews and how healthy it seemed.  I loved that it had bits and pieces of peas, carrots, bananas.  My dogs seemed to really enjoy the food and ate a lot of it, BUT... my boxer developed TERRIBLE smelling gas.  I mean, enough to clear the room.  Some nights I had to sleep in my daughter's room because it was so bad it would wake me up from a dead sleep.  My dachshund started to develop really bad breath, which can be common in small dogs as they get older, but her breath had no smell before being on this food.  My hound mix's hair started to thin and fall out around the base of her tail.  It just seemed too coincidental to start having problems with all three of my dogs after starting this food.<br /><br />So we switched back to Eukanuba Adult dog food after trying out the C&P Ultramix for about three or for months and ALL of the problems have disappeared.  Well, the dachshund's breath is still a little funny but NO WHERE near as bad as it was.  The boxer still has gas, but it is back to the point to where I only hear it... I don't smell it.  And my hound mix's hair looks good again.<br /><br />Do I think this food is terrible?  No, it seems to work for a lot of people and their dogs.  It just didn't work for us.  I wish it did.

Better than most store bought brands. No real complaints.<br /><br />However, I have to put a low rating on this due to the price increase. I know this type of review note is frowned upon, but the nuts are not worth the money that they jacked the price up to. My total order one week ago was $34.48 shipped. Went I went to reorder, the price is now $50.90 including shipping. I do not understand the reason for the sudden price increase, but while the nuts are good, they are not worth this exorbitant price.

Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"
53379,B005PHVMIW,A15LJC8DFPX4P8,6/25/12,1,1,2,Not really into it.,"So I'd like to start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the original Nuvo (aka the ""pink one""). It's very sweet, just the right intensity, everything. I'm not such a fan of this new flavor, however. I guess everyone's different. If you're expecting the signature sweetness of the original flavor, you might be a bit disappointed with the lemon sorbet flavor. I'm not sure but my guess would be that they decided to market this version to please the customers that didn't like the original's sweetness. In any case, you won't like it if you're looking for the sweetness like I was. However, if you're after a pretty strong drink that's kind of tart and maybe a little bitter, you'll like it. I understand why people may go for this one, but I personally won't be buying it again. I prefer the sweeter original flavor."

The other ingredients are the same, so I know it's the pumpkin changing my pie's turnout.<br /><br />The flavor is also different.  Oddly enough, it doesn't have as much pumpkin flavor!<br /><br />Honestly, it makes my home-made pumpkin pie taste more like a cheap store-bought.  Really not nearly as good as when I use Libby pumpkin.  I'm say to say this, as I really prefer organic products, but when it changes the texture and flavor this much, I cannot recommend it.

54512,B001TLY7A8,A1UD16T8XBNNIE,5/14/11,5,8,2,Male Cat Owners Beware Seafood Based Cat Foods,"I recently did research on kidney/renal failure as I just lost one of my male 7 year old cats due to CRF (chronic renal failure). CRF is common in cats, especially male cats due to their intricate urinary system. About a year ago we discovered Weruva & started adding various flavors along with their high quality dry food. My cats totally loved their new canned foods especially Out Back Grill, Asian Fushion and Mack & Jack which happen to be all seafood based. I did not know that a seafood diet is not good for cats. Fish can contribute to urinary tract problems in cats. My cat that had CRF was a slim, but normal weight for his small size, but had lost weight partly due to his high fish diet (I found out fish based cat foods do not contain the fat they need). Wuruva, Tiki Cat,Tiki Cat King Kamehameha Luau Variety Pack Canned Cat Food 12/2.8-oz cans etc are all low fat. Cats need animal fat like chicken fat, fish oil, even emu oil. Besides being needed for their overall health, it's important for their kidneys! Not that I know of any onion eating cats, but I also learned never to give any onion to your cat. Deli (sandwich meat)& some meats (ham, hot dogs) may contain onion powder. The vegetable broths in canned tuna may contain onion. Read the label on any broth (including chicken, beef) as most contain onion or ""spices"". Occasional tuna water from a can of tuna packed in water is okay from what I've read & that is something I have given my cats. Also, I am always careful to keep anything with Xylitol (natural sweetener) away from cats & dogs, that includes toothpaste & gum including the gum wrappers & any toothpaste spatter in the bathroom sink (if your cat likes to sleep in your sink). My CRF cat was the runt of the litter so was a 'small average' size, very active, happy, partially outdoor cat who also ate high quality dry food, but mostly Weruva the past year or so. Over the past year we probably tried every Weruva flavor & it was great seeing how well my cats took to quite a few flavors, especially the fish based ones. I made the error assuming they were getting the right food. I won't be buying fish based cat foods by the case anymore."
54516,B001TLY7A8,A7IZ3OVA96SB5,12/7/11,1,2,2,Damaged cans,"As other reviewers have noted, the product arrived damaged... over half the cans were dented and 3 of them badly enough to compromise the seal (lovely smell). The problem is that a dent near the top of the can causes the lid to separate along the score-line that would normally only separate when you pull the pull-top lid off. It is clear that this happened before the product reached Amazon for shipment as the light bulbs shipped in the same box suffered no ill effects (not to mention the age of the stain on the cans themselves).<br /><br />The product itself seems to be OK; it looks pretty much like the pictured product, though not all of our cats enjoyed it and it has a strong fragrance of fish even when sealed properly - was a hit with one of the cats, not so much the others. For a product at this price point, and at the relative rate of damage noted in other reviews, this is not something I will buy again as I am now concerned that I may have missed a slightly damaged seal and would not want to risk feeding my (spoiled) animals a spoiled product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer is reading this, my first thoughts would be jams at case conveyor transitions, low back-pressure conveyor failure, palletizer/wrapper problems or rough forklift handling. It seems intermittent but frequent and has now cost at least one customer."

54539,B001TLY7A8,ACG58F48XLHA4,7/14/12,0,2,2,Cats won't eat this flavor because they don't like picking out the bones,"At first my cats enjoyed this flavor, but after a few cans they slowed down and started to eat less of it or reject it completely. The times they did nibble at the food, large fish bones and spinal columns were left at the bottom of their bowls. I think my cats simply don't like the flavor because they don't like having to pick all the bones out."

My cats are very picky and only like pure products: chicken, salmon, with nothing in it. I thought it would be a pure chicken product with lots of liquid, which my cats LOVE..... However,  although it is a moist product, I think the can adds a taste that makes my cats dislike it. It is less costly and more environmentally friendly product than the fancy feast Appetizers that are in individual plastic servings but not of the same quality."
54551,B001TLY7A8,A28Q9FYX8JISN9,9/9/09,4,17,2,Beware of the variety you buy,Cats are obligate carnivores.  They should eat 97%+ meat.  A lot of Weruva varieties are packed with veggies.  Veggies aren't good for cats.  Grains aren't good for your cat.  Knowledgeable cat nutrition friends think the Paw licking chicken is fine and their cats love it.  My cats and I hate the veggie-containing varieties they tried.  Look closely at the label before you buy.
54554,B001TLY7A8,A14EK7CK43XIIE,2/21/12,11,13,2,Healthy but extremely low calorie per can (be careful not to underfeed your cat),"When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture).  I looked at the label - it says: ""feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight"".  So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight.  Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended.  But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal.  So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal.  The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15).  In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day.  So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet).  That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand.  I think this product is overpriced and cat owners need to be aware of the calorie content in Weruva's canned cat food, so that they won't underfeed their pets with insufficient amount of calorie."
54558,B001TLY7A8,A2BAZWIT5QLY2J,6/24/11,4,4,2,"It may be good food, but my cat won't eat it",I should have known better than to take a chance on a new cat food bought over the internet. Sophie (my cat)just gobbles up every bit of sauce and leaves all the chicken in the bowl. When I tried to cut up or mash the chicken I realized just how dry and tough it is and don't much blame her for not wanting to deal with it. You just never know if a cat is going to like something or not.
54569,B001TLY7A8,A370LOV1VHBQDA,3/17/11,7,9,2,Less is not More,"I recently changed over from dry to wet food for my cats.  Trying to find a grain, veggie and fruit free food is not easy, cats are obligate carnivores remember and don't need that stuff (do the research).  I thought I found it in this chicken product.  However, when I opened the can I noticed lots of fluid and potato starch. After spilling out the liquid and rinsing off the potato starch (why is that there anyway? A filler?) The can lost 2 oz. of weight.  With the prices of cat food going up and up, I want more not less.  Don't misunderstand me, this is a fairly good product, a little low in fat, but the cats love it just the same. I just want the company to know if they say its 5.5 oz. then don't pump it up with junk to save a few pennies.  Consumers are not stupid."
54570,B001TLY7A8,AMZ9QEWHE7X4Y,7/9/10,18,25,2,Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K),"I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store. My cat absolutely loved it and ate it right up! So, I was pleased and decided to order more... without doing my research. I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small ""made in Thailand"" is on the can and that also freaked me out. The product looks amazing, my cat loves it and I will finish off the cans I bought locally but will be returning this to Amazon. Come on, Weruva, I think you could do better than this. (By the way, Vitamin K is NEEDED for Fish diets in cats, but there are other ways to provide it in the canned foods.)"

However, the product is not what it says it is.  These strawberries are not crunchy, but rather chewy.  For me, they did not have a desirable texture.  It seems that one of two things may have happened here; either not all water was removed during the freeze-drying process or somehow air (and moisture) got into the package, taking away from the product's crunch.  Also buyer beware, because these packages are only 1 ounce, not 1.5 as the picture and product description state."

All in all she does not seem too interested in them. She is not a finicky dog. When fed her morning and afternoon meal she wolfs them down, same with all her other treats. I was hoping she would do the same with these but she mouths it and then drops it. She usually has Innova , but I have not seen her turn away any dog food offered. Because she is not choosy I was very surprised with the high ratings to find her leaving these on the ground and walking away. If I keep giving it to her she will eventually eat them. All these glowing reviews bring to mind a cliche, sometimes some thing to good to be true is just that!"

I used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener. Tonight I've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener. So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end!  This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.<br /><br />The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.<br /><br />With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders.

Plain Sea Salt Lentil Crackers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Crispy crackers don't leave you feeling heavy after snacking.<br />- Different dips or toppings can be paired with it.<br />- Great list of ingredients<br />- Gluten-free<br />- 5g protein in a serving.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Rather bland and tasteless.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I found the crackers to be pretty bland.  They're not overly salty, which is nice, but I guess lentils just don't carry enough flavor on their own.  These crackers are good if you have a dip or topping for them, as their bland flavor makes a great base for just about any dip flavor.<br /><br />These are an okay snack for those on a gluten-free diet.  If you don't need to live gluten-free, find another cracker, for your tastebuds' sake."

The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese.

I had 2 different flavors and they didn't like either one. I had a leftover bag of Iams and they broke into it.  I mixed it with Newmans and they picked it out.  I have now switched to California Natural and they don't throw up and they love the taste.

It has a nice crunchy texture, good nutty flavor, and a sweet glaze.  If you buy cereal just for the taste, this is like gourmet Honey Nut Cheerios.  Very delicious.<br /><br />That said, it is not as vitamin enriched as some other cereals that have similar amounts of sugar, so the trade-off for the sugar is not as good.  Crunchy Nut has 10 grams of sugar per 3/4 cup serving.  Malt O Meal Honey Nut Scooters has 10 grams per 1 cup serving--totally comparable.  But Scooters has more calcium, and zinc, and twice the iron and folic acid.<br /><br />Also, Crunchy Nut costs about 3 times as much as Scooters.<br /><br />My advice:  If taste is king over any other consideration, buy this cereal.  If not, there are other more nutritious, economical options."

While I could detect the ""honey"" flavor, rendered as a glaze more reminiscent of sugar than honey, there is little to no nut flavor.  In deed the product image shows each ""O"" covered in nuts and promises, ""nuts in every bite,"" the actual appearance is much different with no visible nuts on the cereal.<br /><br />The texture is fine.  The crunch holds up in milk.  It is more of an airy texture than say a dense Cheerio.  More the texture of Honeycomb brand cereal.<br /><br />Nutritionally this product is mediocre.  Again not bad, but could be better.  Sugars rack in at 10g, less than many sugar sweetened cereal but still high.  Fiber is 2g which is something, but a bit low.  1g of fat is gaood and none of it saturated or trans fat.<br /><br />I will finish the box, but will not by more of these again."

If it only tasted like butterscotch, I could forgive this unusual shade. But Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut & Honey is far from Kellogs' best effort! The cereal was rather bland, and the promised crunch reminded me only of the familiar ""Captain"" cereal of the same name. I just did not get the nut and honey experience that is available in other brands. As a new cereal on the market, this cereal won't last long, I predict. It isn't anything different than those that have been around awhile, those that present this variety much, much better. Also . . . Vine clearly stated ""10.8 oz. pack of four"" and I just received one box. Not that I miss it, but I at least could have given the promised remaining three to my sons who are in college.

There is a weird cloying aftertaste, and the cereal feels too dry, the individual pieces too large, and too crunchy. It just wasn't for me. The kidlets think it is okay but prefer Honey Nut Cheerios or even Raisin Bran (my fave) to this - and that's not a good sign.<br /><br />Bottom Line: YMMV, but I won't be replacing this box with another one."

However, while the cereal itself is ""not bad"" it's lacking in many areas.<br /><br />First and foremost it's not made with whole grains like Honey Nut Cheerios is.  Another reviewer put it nicely when they said this is equivalent to eating candy for breakfast.  The amount of sugar and refined carbohydrates is way too much for any type of health benefit whatsoever.  The peanuts are so small and in such small pieces (more like granules) that I don't consider them anywhere near enough to consider any health benefits from the nuts.<br /><br />The taste itself is good, and it's a bit softer of a crunch than most cereals, but outside of that it's just too many carbohydrates to be on the breakfast table.  Kellog's could really improve this cereal by getting rid of some of the added sweetners and switch to a whole grain recipe.  Until then, if you like sweet cereals with little health benefits then this is for you -- but otherwise, stick with Honey Nut Cheerios."

I figured these Kellogg's Crunchy Nut O's were worth a shot, however, as they had both honey and peanuts going for them.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. I thought this cereal was much, much too sweet, and felt that it left a bad corn aftertaste in my mouth. My husband, a huge fan of Honey Nut Cheerios, didn't like this either. After a few bowls, the box sat untouched in my cupboard for months until I finally threw it out. Definitely not for us!"

I thought that it was another version of Quaker's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPMKRC"">Honey Graham O's Cereal, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. As such, I was pretty excited. I mean, I like Oh!s. It's one of my favorite cereals.<br /><br />Then the aftertaste caught me. And made me start looking at the ingredient list. I am guessing that it is the corn bran that they put in here, but the aftertaste is somewhere between burned popcorn and Honey Smacks (you know...the one with Dig 'Em Frog). Not so much ideal.<br /><br />If you don't mind the aftertaste, it's pretty reasonable cereal. There are only around 100 calories per 3/4 cup serving, so it's not terribly bad for you like many oversweetened cereal. I think that this is probably the vanguard of an effort by Kellog's to sweeten their cereals with honey, but they haven't quite gotten it figured out just yet. Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't think that it was super sweet, but it certainly was sweeter than my normal cereal.<br /><br />ALLERGY WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS PEANUTS.<br /><br />Harkius"

A friend who used the same amount of cereal and milk didn't experience that, so it's probably different for everybody.<br /><br />Secondly, several times as I was eating, I found a clump of compressed peanut bits and dust.

My favorite cereals are Honey Nut Cheerios, Honey Bunches of Oats, or Crispix.  If it is my birthday or a camping trip and I am going to indulge in a sweet cereal I prefer Frosted Flakes. Cereal tends to be a sweet breakfast treat, and not a staple in our home, so I can overlook the nutrition facts.<br /><br />Probably the best way I could describe Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is ""greasy Kix.""  It left a funky aftertaste and slime on my tongue.  The flavor, even before the aftertaste, wasn't good, though it was not the most horrible cereal in the world.  It was edible so I gave it an one star more than something... inedible.  My son thought it was ok, though not a favorite, but this seems to be packaged as an ""adult"" cereal so his vote doesn't count.  I was done after my first bowl and let him finish the rest over the course of two weeks.  This is unusual in my house as we usually go to blows on who gets the last bowl of cereal.  Even my son did not ask to repurchase!<br /><br />Unfortunately this failed for me.  Sorry Kellogg's!"

I would prefer to eat Quaker Ohs! And they are always cheapier.  So many good cereal choices out there to waste time on something boring.  Skip them.
55697,B004CYLW7A,A1F7AFVBKHSOT8,2/15/11,0,0,2,Sugar Crunch,"Far from a ""perfect mix"" of flavors, Cruchy Nut cereal is basically your average sugary cereal.  Sadly, the sugar is about all you taste, there is no distinct honey or nut flavor, just sugar and crunch.<br /><br />I can't imagine this is any healthier than Captain Crunch or Lucky Charms, and with those cereals, you actually have distinctive flavors.  As an attempt to invade the Honey Nut Cheerios market, this is entirely a failure."

However this is the second time we've had to arrange for a replacement shipment because the manufacturer isn't able to provide consistent quality. When ideal, the treats are moist and chewy, like jerky, but the treats in this last shipment were as hard as bricks...essentially devoid of any moisture. Our little dog knows what to do with them but it breaks our hearts watching her try to eat them.<br />I talked with the manufacturer the first time there was a problem. They were very apologetic and explained they were correcting the issue. Guess their old nemesis has returned. Amazon is also very nice about it and is replacing the most recent shipment at no additional charge. We'll have to see whether our dog can enjoy the replacement."

Also, the shards are quite sharp and I got a little worried.  They were insanely messy for in the house.  I think for the money I would rather buy either those hard, filled bones or the rolled up raw hides.  They last longer, are less messy, and don't have sharp pieces for the dogs to swallow."

When the frostings came out I was excited to have a convenient source of frosting in a pinch.  The directions were easy, the prep a breeze but the final product fell short.  The frosting was too sweet with an overpowering vanilla taste-and I love vanilla. I would have to say the vanilla tasted artificial since it was so strong. I make a beautiful vanilla buttercream and although I did not expect a final product of this caliber, I expected better than what I tasted. Skip this product and take a few extra minutes to make your own."

56104,B0002DIO2G,AVRK0MPQ7LD7E,11/24/11,0,0,2,lots of sharp twigs,"My cats seem to like the smell of this catnip.  However, I usually crush catnip to release the scent before I give it to the cats.  With this product, I have been getting sharp splinters from the woody part of the plant in my fingers.  I have noticed the cats sometimes seem to also get jabbed.  I won't buy this brand again."
56105,B0002DIO2G,A4ZQZP41D95JO,9/14/11,0,0,2,You get what you pay for?  Or is catnip tantamount to snake oil?,"This is the first catnip I've bought.  It seemed the best bang for the buck at the time of purchase, especially considering the top rated brand was 1/3 the amount for the same price.  I've used it in toys, rubbed it between my fingers as the package directs, etc.; yet our three month old kitten just doesn't seem to care.  She'll ""usually"" come up and take a whiff when I open the bag or coax her to see what I've got in my hand, but she quickly loses interest.  And it never manages to put her into some euphoric state, much less even settle her down, when she's running around, going crazy, as growing, restless housecats do.<br /><br />The catnip smells mostly like ground tea leaves, to me.  The only praise I can offer regards the volume that comes in the package compared to most other offerings on amazon, and that it comes in a resealable bag - not a ""ziplock"" bag like another reviewer indicated; it's clearly a professionally packaged product, but one with a ziplock style closure.  And, as others have noted, the bag is 3oz NOT 3.5 as amazon's title erroneously misadvertises.  Even so, it's still the best value on amazon, assuming it works as well as the other, more expensive, brands.  Considering all but maybe the most expensive has received mixed reviews of effectiveness, and that the best rated/most expensive option appears to be charging more for a tin can, I'm reluctant to invest more in a product that may only be effective for certain cats, if indeed it's not another form of snake oil.  Maybe I should have done my usual research beforehand.<br /><br />Update:  Having put this in several toys, a cardboard scratching pad and even sprinkled a little on her food once or twice per week, our kitten not only shows disinterest in this product now, but practically runs away when I open the bag as if the smell actually offends her.  We have three large, cat-eating dogs outside, which we rescued her from right after they got two of her siblings - they had wondered into the dogs radio fence boundaries and got trapped inside a tractor - so she has to stay indoors.  I was really hoping this might settle her down when she gets stir crazy.  But it doesn't, not in the least."

Let's just say that while it has lasted a long time, the rice is lacking. I didn't think it was possible for rice to be lacking but this Tilda Basmati rice just doesn't taste or smell the way I am used to basmati tasting and smelling.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing this bag again."
56175,B0016LL5DS,AFXGM14T2OWZE,1/3/11,0,2,2,Not a Nutella-killer,"I love hazelnuts and hazelnut spreads, or so I thought. But it seems that the competition is still far behind Nutella in getting the right taste. The reason I bought this product is that American Nutellas have trans fats, which I obviously wanted to avoid, and the Nutellas sold on Amazon are not European ones or at least not German versions. But this hazelnut spread is just too sweet for my liking. It wasn't bad for a small change, but I will never buy any product other than Nutella, especially for this price."
56186,B0039ZOZ86,A1O3ONM1MJM7EM,7/21/11,2,3,2,OK for an alternative snack,"Purchased this variety pack and although I was VERY impressed with Amazon Prime shipping (I literally received it in less than 24 hours!), the snack itself is average tasting.  Mostly like flavorless cardboard.  The best flavor is the jalapeno one, pretty spicy.  It satisfies the crunch and salt factor, but no way is this a replacement for real chips.  I recommend PopChips original flavor which reminds me of Munchos, or PopChips BBQ flavor; both are satisfying and taste very good.  I would NOT purchase these Gourmet Basics Smart Fries again.  I even joked with my co-workers when they asked me what I was eating..""They're Smart Fries, but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good!""  They tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me."
56201,B0039ZOZ86,A1JXKGZFD3ZVHL,3/27/12,0,0,2,Air,eating these was sort of like eating a salted air bubble.  It was great for snacking because it takes a while to eat one package but they really tasted like salty air.  I am not sure I really liked them at all.

I tried the Honey Mustard & Onion as well as the Sea Salt.  The Honey Mustard & Onion has a decent flavor but it fades almost as soon as you start crunching.  The Sea Salt had almost no flavor at all.  The texture is great, a bit like a skinnier, more crunchy (yet light) Cheese puff.  I love the texture, I love the idea but the flavor needs to be amped up CONSIDERABLY.  I wish I hadn't purchase so much since I don't want to eat them."

When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless ""potato sticks"" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the ""sea salt"" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual ""fry""<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally.

It was so hard and chewy that it hurt my jaw.  The taste was ok, not as chocolatey as I had hoped.  The caramel was good but pretty sticky, and it got on my fingers.  The nuts and things on the outside were pretty good, but kept falling off and onto the floor.  I guess I'll try for a less messy kashi bar next time."

I wanted to get something special for her, so Naturally I went to one of the more expensive items in this area. I waited for her to get the package and had her call me as she opened the box and tasted her first piece of very expensive chocolate. She was very happy to get the gift and thrilled that I had remembered her in this way. And that is about as far as the excitement went. She ate no more than one or a half of the chocolates a day. As each piece of chocolate is two servings. She kept the slip of paper from the box that told of each chocolate and what you were getting. As the days went on and she was telling me how she enjoyed the chocolates, the truth came out. These were nice chocolates. Nice, but not worth the money you spend on them. I told her that the next box of chocolates I get would be DIFFERENT. When she had finished the box I ordered her TWO boxes of the variety of Kirkland Chocolates. I actually spent less on TWO boxes than I had on this one small box of Chocolates. She was thrilled  not only with the fact of a gift again, but at the taste of the chocolates. She loved the Kirkland chocolates, and requested that I never spend the money on the Moonstruck Chocolates again. Although I didn't sample the candy, I believe that if you want more for your money, and a good piece of candy, skip the Moonstruck and go for the Kirkland box of chocolates.

At first I didn't make the connection to the food.  She's 11 years old so I wondered if she was developing diabetes.  She also started having accidents in the house, which she had not done since puppyhood, so maybe a bladder infection?  I took her to the vet.  He checked her urine and said there was no infection but the ph was high.  He suggested changing her diet.  As soon as I did that my dog resumed her normal water consumption and stopped peeing in the house.  This food must have a lot of salt or something.  I would not recommend it."

In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week."

Perhaps they're something left over from our last Halloween Day give-aways. In any case, neither my wife nor I will eat them, and I'm hesitant to give them to the baby. They're neither good fruit nor are they good candy. They taste about as much like fruit as Kool-Aid does. I tried one and it stuck tightly to my teeth. Great, just what I need, some sugary stuff stuck to my teeth. I'm going to make certain all are out of the house this Halloween, but maybe I shouldn't do that to the neighborhood kids.

Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again.

It's a good value (cheaper here than at Whole Foods!), but as much as I love this tea, a case of it lasts a long time, and at some point in the months between when I ordered the previous case and my last order, the company sneakily changed the recipe!<br /><br />I thought the flavor was a little off, so I compared the ingredient list on the new box to the list on my last old box, and there was one difference.  Both lists included ""pomegranate flavor,"" but the ""powdered pomegranate juice"" from the old box's ingredient list (also here on Amazon's ingredient list) is missing from the new box!  (I checked the Yogi Tea website, and their info confirms the change -- there's no more actual pomegranate juice in the tea at all.)  I assume real flavoring from a real food became too expensive...  So disappointing!<br /><br />I loved this tea because it wasn't super-sweet like all the other pomegranate green teas out there.  The tartness of pomegranate showed through the added stevia, and there was just a tiny touch of peppermint tossed in to make the flavor really bright -- it was refreshing iced!  The new formula/recipe is sweeter and flatter in flavor and the tartness is more... harsh.  Perhaps other people will still love it, but if you're here like me looking for your old favorite, consider yourself warned!!"

I was delighted to find it available here on Amazon when I got home.  I ordered several cases of the assorted ""rainbow"" flavors and was a happy camper UNTIL Nutrisoda changed everything  -  the cans and the flavors!  The ""new"" flavors, even if they call them by the same names as the originals, are NOT the same.  There are fewer flavors - only four as opposed to the original seven, and these newer sodas, even with the same names, do not taste anywhere as good as the originals.  My favorite was this one  -  the Energize  -  but it's just not the same drink that was in the pretty orange can.  Not sure why Nutrisoda decided to make the changes, but I'm not buying any more."

BUT, I am a tea reviewer and above all, it is important for me to tell it like it is, and sometimes that requires me to say something is bad when it is.<br /><br />And unfortunately, this Peach Matcha just doesn't hold up to the other Matcha teas that I've tried.  I've tried quite a few of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha (as you can tell by looking at the number of reviews that I've posted), and there have only been two that I've not enjoyed - this one and the apricot.<br /><br />Prepared traditionally using hot water and whisking, this is has a strong chemical taste that is really off-putting.  However ... and this Matcha's one redeeming quality which is why I gave it two stars instead of one ... if you make it as a latte, it ends up tasting much better.  The chemical taste is nearly gone (there are still traces of this taste, but it is very faint) and I can taste the peach and the matcha.  These flavors are also muted a bit because of the milk, but, it makes a nice, tasty matcha latte that tastes of matcha and peach.<br /><br />However, even though the latte was far better than the traditionally prepared Matcha ... I can't give it a higher rating because of that chemical taste.  I do hope that Red Leaf Tea considers finding a better flavoring for the peach and the apricot.  I had high hopes for them."

They had a ""what's the problem"" response when I expressed disappointment with the lack of variety and the expired goods, and they were always traveling, so communication was slow.

This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.

It was barely different from the ""Perfect Iced Tea -- Sweet Lemon Tea,"" and didn't have the bite of lemonade.

I chose All Bran because it did not contain aspartame.  I got home and started reading the ingredients & realized the second ingredient is sugar and also contains high fructose corn syrup. It has 8 grams of sugar per serving, but they list a serving as only 1/3 cup.  Who do they think they are kidding?  An average American eats more than that for breakfast.  Do they think consumers are stupid?<br /><br />A box of Kashi 7 Whole Grain Flakes with Black Currants & Walnuts cereal lists a serving as 1 cup and contains only 10 grams of sugar for that whole cup.  Uncle Sam cereal with Real Mixed Berries contains NO added sweetner of any kind and 1 cup of it contains only 2 grams of naturally occuring sugar coming mostly from the berries.  Wow!  You mean a cereal manufacturer is brave enough to make a cereal without adding sugar?  Yes and it is good.  In comparison eating 1 cup of All Bran Buds would be consuming 24 grams of sugar.  No thanks!<br /><br />If anyone at Kellogg's is reading this please know that people who are buying these types of cereals are not buying them primarily for the taste but for the health benefits.  We are not the ""Kindergarten Crowd"" who needs sugar added to everything to get us to eat it.  If I want to consume extra sugar I'll eat a cookie once in a while as a treat.  If I am going to eat a cereal everyday to incorporate fiber into my diet it is not going to be one that has unneeded amounts of sugar.<br /><br />Why can't the big name cereal manufacturers use stevia as an alternative sweetner?  It has been used for years in Europe with no known side effects. The consumers buying these types of cereals who are trying to watch their sugar consumption and increase their fiber would gladly welcome less or preferably no sugar or a healthy sweetner such as stevia."

As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/""legs"", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz ""cup"" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee."

There are much better, brighter and fresher tasting mustards available at half the cost of this one.<br /><br />However, this is a Dave's Gourmet product and as such I am looking for not just a good mustard but but one that makes a good use of a variety of heat producing, tongue scorching peppers, like Serrano or maybe even Habanero.  What we get instead is a mediocre Dijon-style mustard spiced up with ""hot pepper extract"".  This is a commercial additive of pure (or close to pure) capsicum, which is used for riot control and to add heat to an otherwise bland product.  In my humble opinion hot pepper extract adds ""hotness"" without adding to the flavor.  Dave's has some great products, I just don't think that this is one of them."

Usually I do read ingredients before using any product, but I'd never ran into a problem with Earths Best before. My Daughter has a dairy allergy and in general doesn't like anything that contains dairy. So when she seemed fussy about eaiting this, a red flag went up for me as she usually eats whatever I feed her. Better labeling with a dairy or milk content warning would be a plus, or if in the description it listed not only the types of ""soups"" in this variety pack, but also the ingredients. I can't say what a baby without a dairy allergy might think of this product, but mine wanted nothing to do with it."

I believe firmly in buying American for a number of reasons and none of them are political ( will most of them anyway)l. More of us, I believe, should think this way in order to produce more jobs in our country and not depend on other countries, and whatever their sanitary conditions dictate which could be very much unlike the FDA standards in America. I also believe that Amazon.com should stipulate where each product is made and not the double talk about "" packaged in Canada"" which could mean purchased in China and then packed in Canada. The only way to improve our country is to rely on Americans to produce products, receive the rewards of their labors and stabilize the economy-now that may be political but it's the damn truth."

I may try another Boyers blend of a more robust nature.<br /><br />This blend is considerably milder than Starbuck's house blend.<br /><br />A major disappointment!<br /><br />I tried Boyer's ""Rocky Mountain Thunder"" which I found was much more to my taste.

58326,B00061KYYK,A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q,8/6/10,0,1,2,Mild heat combined with far too much vinegar,"This is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc<br /><br />Yet why have I rated it 2 stars? The simple answer it has far too much vinegar and it ends up tasting like vinegar and a bit bitter too. In addition, this sauce lacks any character beyond that heavy dose of vinegar. Now, if you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you might love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are much better ones, including ones that have a fair amount of vinegar.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.<br /><br />BTW: You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!<br /><br />Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then you can save a lot of money by buying it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They don't cost much more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar or is at least - better balanced.<br /><br />Try any of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a vague hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! It has no vinegar, is considerably more potent than Franks, yet just a bit sweet. Compared to Franks you have to be careful not to add too much.<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - low to medium heat and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar but is diluted, much like Franks yet with a far superior taste. Highly recommended<br /><br />c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend and not so hot that it is unforgiving.<br /><br />d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.<br /><br />e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but still far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.<br /><br />If you happen to like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of the ABOVE. For only a few bucks for a bottle, what is there to lose?<br /><br />I hope Amazon customers will rate my review after taste testing one of these other hot sauces.<br /><br />My very best<br /><br />Thanks"

Unfortunately, beside a lot of sugar these chips are loaded with saturated fats - almost certainly with plenty of trans fats since the oils are listed as being partially-hydrogenated [trans fat content not described on label].

First off, the nutrition information is really impressive compared to traditional Mac 'n cheese so for a family trying to eat healthy, I did not have a problem eating this.

Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.

It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity."

I just ordered it October 25, 2010! Why they would still have items shelved that expired that long ago is beyond me! And, if you think about it, it's quite disturbing. Stocking, and selling, an organic tea that expired six months ago all the while marking it as new! To add insult to injury, Online stores does NOT provide a return shipping label, so I had to pay additional fees to send it back. This was AFTER I went to the website they mentioned on the order packing form to try to process the return that way only to find that the website is down. Suppose I shouldn't have been surprised.

60050,B000Z8T6ES,A9RTRKZM3IEOY,8/3/10,6,6,2,Disappointing,"When I first found that fresh garlic was available on Amazon, I was stoked.  We go through LOTS of garlic at home, to the point where we'd be buying at least six large heads of garlic every week.  Super, I thought, three pounds of garlic delivered so I'll be stocked all the time!  The price for the size of the bag was very good, I thought.<br /><br />When I received the garlic, however, I was very disappointed in the quality.  I began using the garlic the very night I received it, so it was not sitting in my pantry for months.  Here is what I found:  Fully half the bag was either rotten, shriveled, or sprouting.  This is indicative of garlic that has been sitting around for some time and/or improperly stored.  When stored properly, fresh garlic remains fresh, firm, and crisp for weeks... or months.  Many of the heads in the bag were completely rotten all the way through.  Some were just light for their size and the cloves were wrinkled and shriveled.  An equal number were in an advanced stage of sprouting.  Those that were suitable for use were OK, but only just that.  These were not fresh heads of garlic.<br /><br />Very disappointed, I contacted Casa de Fruta via email.  After my second message, they were kind enough to ship a brand new bag immediately.  To their credit, the new bag of garlic arrived very quickly.  It was definitely better than the first, but I still lost about 10 heads of garlic to rot and shriveling; that's still a lot in a 3 pound bag, and what would have been a great deal for a full bag of fresh, crisp garlic turned out to be just a real disappointment and a bad deal for a bag of average-to-poor-to-unusable garlic.  For reference, I went through the entire second bag in less than a month, and it was stored in a cool, dry environment.  It was stored properly, in other words.<br /><br />So, at this point I don't know what to think.  I based my original purchase on the few - and all excellent - reviews and, indeed, I would have rated the garlic at 4 stars + had the second bag contained what I was expecting from the reviews.  That was not my experience, however.  It is possible, I suppose, that I was just twice unlucky.  Still, you'd think that the company would have made certain that the second bag sent, DUE to a customer complaint of quality no less, would have been totally primo.  I've got to go with the odds on this one then, and take my garlic business elsewhere.<br /><br />One final note:  Had it not been for courteous and timely response from the vendor, I would have rated this product at one star rather than two based on the quality."

60139,B000EDG598,A1698Y18IW609N,10/21/08,80,90,2,"Gluten Free and SCD, yes, but NOT My Top Pick","While these arrived fresh, freshness isn't the only hallmark of a quality product.  You can get the same results with a good food processor (i.e. a Kitchen Aid). This is NOT a fine, even grind.  If I sift the product, I find a lot of chunks.  I want a fine EVEN grind when using nut meal/flour (the terms are used interchangeably in the industry) as the main or only flour in my baked goods.<br /><br />Since this brand is easy to find in many supermarkets, I do recommend it for some uses.  It's good for folks who don't do mail order, those non-GF cooks looking to lower the carb count of their bread coatings, and those looking for an easy GF or a no-carb ""breading"" option, but only when a coarse coating is suitable. For instance I like fine coatings if I'm going to ""pan fry"" a white/light flesh fish fillet.<br /><br />When used as the main or only flour for baking, the batter will look lumpy and the finished product will taste a bit gritty. It won't perform well in some recipes because the chunkier nature of the grind will affect the way the batter handles moisture, which could result in a dense rather than light texture.  It could also yield products that fall severely upon cooling.<br /><br />In order words, disappointing outcomes might not be the recipe or your culinary technique, it could be your choice in ingredients!"

The texture wasn't flourlike at all, it had huge clumps and the almond flour cookies I made (with an almond flour recipe) were HORRIBLE - grainy to the point that they would not even stay in a cookie shape, no matter how careful I was. Investigated after this and apparently Bob's Red Mill is known for this. I haven't really had issues with their other flours I've used (I'm on a gluten free diet like many people writing reviews for BRM products) so I think maybe they just don't grind the almonds fine enough? Not sure what exactly the issue is, but it is honestly unusable in recipes relying on lots of almond flour. Now I have 3 bags of it left and just mix a little in with other GF things I'm baking for a bit of added nutrition. If there's not too much in the flour mix, it doesn't affect the texture badly enough to ruin it, but you can still feel it a little. Blech. Who wants to buy a flour you have to grind fine yourself? I don't own a food processor, so it's not even an option for me. Might as well just make it myself at this price."

I had put my machine up in the closet for two years, hoping that maybe the coffees would taste better when I pulled it back down.  Nope.  The syrup is good, but the coffee itself is extremely bitter and it tastes burned -- even more burned than the 'green mermaid' coffee.  My machine goes back up on the closet shelf for another year... the concept is awesome, the machine is neat, but when the drinks taste like burned coffee beans, I just won't use it.<br /><br />I'm not giving up on you yet, Tassimo... but the K-Cups at work sure do taste a lot better than the stuff coming out of the Tassimo..."

I love chocolate mixed with peppermint and had really high hopes for this blend.  It tasted like Gas-X mixed with coffee, and just like Gas-X it stayed with you the rest of the day . . . Not too festive for a holiday coffee.  I must say the regular mocha is delightful!  Note:  This is WAY cheaper on Tassimo.com, thus I don't feel so guilty throwing it out."

Rereading the full product description I still feel this wasn't clear. So in the end I thought I ended up paying like $25 ($12 for chocolate and the rest for shipping) for two disks of chocolate that actually cost like $4 each at a store within walking distance. If I had known this was for a single flavor disk and not a variety pack I'd have steered clear of this and just walked down to the corner. Mostly my fault yes but the description of what you will reeive is lacking.

Maybe they're good as rubs or marinades?  I made the various dressing mixes listed on the side of the bottles, but I didn't have the heart to put them on meat.<br /><br />I had two big problems:<br />1) All of the dressing recipes are super, super, super vinegary.  Even if you cut back on the vinegar, you're still left with super, super vinegary.  If you're from South Carolina, this might be your thing.  I'm not, it isn't.<br />2) They all smell and taste similar!  You know how every variety of Sam Adams tastes like, well... Sam Adams?  These mixes have the same issue.  If I had to guess, I'd say that ""herb blend"" that's the first ingredient on each bottle is the same blend - something proprietary that the makers spin off in different directions to make the different dressings.<br /><br />They are relatively healthy, without any scary fillers or sugar or whatnot, but Annie's, Wegman's and Brianna's make whole lines of relatively healthy dressings that actually taste good.  I'll be going back to those, or making my own herb mixes."

Enjoyed it as part of a variety pack bought at my grocery store so ordered the same tea in bulk here.  However, the packaging of tea shipped by Amazon is inadequate and makes this tea nearly unusuable.  Each tea bag opens at the top when the tag/label string is pulled apart from the bag just before using the tea bag. The adhesive holding the top of the tea bags together is not strong enough to withstand even tiny, gentle pull from trying to ""unstick"" the tag and string from the bag.  Other than that the packaging is normal Lipton packaging (white paper outer envelope for each bag, thin cardboard box.  But this one defect is enough to make the tea unusuable (unless you like sifting it through your teeth as you drink) without resorting to self help such as personally stapling each tea bag closed after loosing the tag.  While the tea itself is ok and a nice light green tea for those who don't like the really strong kind, this is too much annoyance, I tossed these and will not reorder this brand of tea online, especially in bulk.  I am a lifelong tea drinker and have not experienced this problem with any other teas with anywhere near such frequency as I have with each box in this 6-pack of boxes of Lipton Green Tea.

But, 5-hour, like all of these energy drinks (Monster, RockStar, RedBull, Cocaine etc.) is obscenely overpriced liquid caffeine. As of 2008, there have been no large scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials that show the ingredients, other than caffeine, in these ""proprietary blends"" actually work in healthy humans as advertised. When pressed, the manufacturers cannot come up with the data that support their hype. To date, only good ol' caffeine is the only over-the-counter drug that does what people who buy these overpriced snake-oils desire. So, save your money. Buy ANY drink you like and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill like max strength NoDoz or Vivarin. Cheers."

I had trouble finding them in local stores, so I ordered this box from Amazon.  The price was good and there were no problems with the shipping.  There is only enough caffeine equivalent to one cup of coffee in each bottle.  I'm a huge coffee drinker, so this product did not work for me.  I did not feel any more energy when I needed it and it did not keep me awake or alert.  In fact, I got stomach cramps and diarrhea for several days after using this product.  I'm physically fit and do the P90X workouts. I eat healthy food and rarely have abnormal bowel movements or diarrhea.  As a test, I did not use this product for a week and felt fine with normal bowel movements.  I then used another 5 Hour Drink and the next day, diarrhea again!

I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I'm a pretty big wimp so I didn't do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.  I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report.  I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G"">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>.  I think I found a good combination for me, finally.<br /><br />The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!

The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are ""Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine"".

Not to mention you can split the caff. tabs in half when you're already ""up"" and don't want to risk the anxiety that comes with a full tablet, which consists of 200mg of caffeine. Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it.

I've also taken <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3WFFG"">iSatori Energize All Day Energy Pill, Tablets, 84-Count Bottle</a> in the past and also plain caffeine pills, and either one of those options would also be a fine substitute for 5-hour.<br /><br />Bottom line - if I get one for free I'll drink it, but why take a $2 shot instead of a 33 cent pill?"
60666,B003QNJYXM,A1M831U4D1PUYV,11/11/11,0,1,2,Didn't taste good and didn't provide energy,"The first thing I noticed was the taste was overwhelming - but I figured that's fine - vitamins usually don't taste terrific.  But afterwards I didn't really have an increase in energy.  Instead, I just felt dehydrated and nauseous.  An overall sick feeling.  Even worse, I actually felt *tired* after a few hours.  It may work for some people, but definitely not all people."
60673,B003QNJYXM,AI92S157QG6NL,1/7/11,3,6,2,"Works, but feeling after isn't worth it","This product does work. I have taken it multiple times. Every time I do take this 5 hour energy, I am more alive and aware.<br />It helps, but it makes me crash real bad at the end. It says no crash, but just last night when I took this, I couldn't keep my eyes open after taking it, I kept trying to stay awake, soon as I laid on my bed, at 9 pm. I woke up at 1 pm the next day. I missed the entire morning because I had crashed so unbelievably hard.<br /><br />I do not recommend this to everyone, everyone has a different reaction to it, but mine wasn't so good.<br />I suggest if you take these when ""Not Tired"" to avoid heavy crashes like mine. I took mine after being up for around 18 hours. So take them when you are only feeling a little worn out, not exhausted or restless."

I don't think anyone who has said they've had great success with this product is lying, nor do I think those that have said they've had little success are lying.  As such this is a product you have to try to see what happens for you.<br /><br />I am not a huge consumer of energy products, but I do like to them from time to time.  My standard has been Rockstar Zero Carb (i.e. no sugar) which is a full size energy drink.  I have found that it works well and usually I don't need to drink the entire can.  The appeal of 5-hour Energy is its small size and easy storage.  I don't drink Rockstar for it's outstanding taste, so if I can get the energy in something smaller and easier to consume, why not try?<br /><br />I first tried 1/2 a bottle of 5-hour Energy as some of the reviews made me a bit wary of how I might react.  I found that 1/2 bottle had almost no effect.  On a different day I tried the entire bottle and again I saw almost no effect.  It is possible that there was a slight pickup, but nothing that would make this product worth buying.  I find this a bit strange because the ingredients and amounts appear to be more than what is found in the Rockstar Zero Carb mentioned above.  As such I would expect at least the same level of energy pickup, but again that wasn't close to being the case.<br /><br />I am not going to throw in the towel just yet, however.  I plan to try the ""extra strength"" version of this product to see if that yields a better result.  For now though, while I cannot personally recommend this product based on my own results, I think each person will have to try and see for themselves.<br /><br />Update: I tried the ""extra strength"" version of this product.  I took the entire bottle and found little to no difference between this and the ""regular"" version.  Since the regular version, as mentioned above, had pretty much no effect on me, I don't plan to buy anymore of this product."

I saw one of these in my brother's car, and he didn't want it, so I decided to go for it. I drank the whole bottle, and I felt the effects after about 30 min. I didn't have any weird side effects, but I noticed myself twitching a lot. It does some things correctly, as physically I feel decent, but mentally I feel awful. It's the kind of feeling you get when you want to go to sleep, but you can't. The best word to describe it is restless. It also tastes awful, but you can't really mark it down based on taste, as it's not obviously supposed to be something that tastes good.<br /><br />I'll give it a couple of stars for making me feel a little better physically, but that's still questionable, as it also made me very twitchy. Definitely not a product I'd recommend to anyone, unless they felt physically fatigued. A lot of people here seem satisfied with it, so maybe it's just me."

Unfortunately, it  was not. The effect I feel after downing a bottle is marginal. Maybe a boost in alertness for a few minutes but quickly back to the same level of drowsiness I was at. Two bottles does not help much either.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it seems to work so well with others but I wish I had the same effects. I am 6 foot 2 inches and around 250 lbs. Not sure if it works well only with smaller individuals.<br /><br />Despite not working so well for me, I still take it occasionally on the road for the small effect it does offer - though I do wonder if it's more placebo effect than anything."

He's sampled a variety of foods, loves most everything (including unexpected favorites like broccoli and prunes), and almost always, to quote one of our favorite bedtime stories, ""eats all before him with smiles and goodwill."" But these Training Meals from Plum Organics are a notable exception. We tried three different varieties (Pasta with Chicken and Vegetables, Harvest Vegetable with Turkey, and Multigrain Super Greens), and so far, we're zero for three. My son's most favorable reaction was to the Multigrain Super Greens, which he ate, but begrudgingly so, with wrinkled nose and other negative facial expressions. The other two, well... He alternated between pulling faces, emphatically pushing away the spoon, spitting the food out and, on at least one occasion, actually gagging. I'm disappointed. We've loved this brand's fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;es since my son started eating solids, but he's old enough now that he needs to be eating more proteins and more textured foods, and I really thought these would fit the bill. I really wanted to like them, too, as I still haven't found many quick, delicious, organic/wholesome and BPA-free ways to incorporate chicken, turkey and nutrient-rich green vegetables into my son's diet. Unfortunately, it seems these pouches are not the way to go. Guess it's back to the drawing board for Plum Organics, and back to homemade baby food for us."

I have two pomeranians and broke one of these in half I noticed how thick they were and watched both of them carefully as they were eating them. They each ate their share half way and then they could fit the bones fully in their mouths where they could easily get stuck. I thought I could break them down in really tiny pieces so they could at least enjoy the rest of them but, it was impossible to do and I ended up throwing them away. Of course they would last a lot longer if you gave each one the entire bone but,they are still somewhat too big for my dogs and you would still end up throwing part away.<br /><br />I was going to give the product one star but, if it wasnt for the choking hazard I think these would be great treats."

61066,B000FA38ZY,A43WCF8W3GM8Z,11/21/11,1,2,2,"Great stuff, but get it locally.","I know how Mallowmars taste. They are the truly splendid fall treat I have looked forward to around thanksgiving for as long as I can remember. So what I really was checking via this order was how well they ship.<br /><br />The answer is, terrible. The over long, Two weeks of delivery time turned the cookie part to crumbs on almost every one. The chocolate was melted to the plastic tray on half of them (only half?).  Overall a fail, and certainly not something you would want to open up in front of guests.<br /><br />Get them locally or find a replacement. Splurge on faster shipping perhaps? I can not vouch for that option having not tried it though. As is, the standard shipping makes for sad mallomars pandas.<br /><br />The second star is for the two in the box that had part of a cookie left and were somewhat edible."
61068,B000FA38ZY,A2I3XS9TO93Q0F,11/16/11,1,2,2,A nice treat... but not compatible with most shipping.,"On the basis of taste alone, Mallomars would get 4 stars from me.  These were non-messy S'mores alternatives long before people even heard of S'mores; starting with a graham cracker-type base, then a layer of marshmallow and all capped with delicious chocolate.  They're a great treat, even if the temptation is to keep popping one in your moouth after the other.<br /><br />The problem here is that a single package doesn't travel well.  Consider the way a lot of boxes can be tossed around in mail and UPS trucks and you start to get an idea as to the problem.  About half of the cookies that were in my shipment were either broken or crumbly.  That kind of detracts from things.  And before you have images of some small package delivery guy tossing the box every which away, this wasn't that kind of damage.  This was the kind of crumbing and breakage that's almost unavoidable in a small carton... IF... it's going to be shipped through any method other than a shrink wrapped pallet.  I like the treat, I just wish it wasn't so crumby by the time it gets to my hand."
61074,B000FA38ZY,A1B3GNO9C8YX0N,10/28/11,1,2,2,Not very good,"I remember these from childhood but I guess those memories aren't that accurate. These were very dry, poor quality chocolate and mediocre marshmallow. All combine to make an underwhelming product. There are other mass market products that are similar but better, such as the Pinwheels also from Nabisco. There are also very high quality versions out there from small, specialty manufacturers; chocolate teacakes from the UK, similar products from other countries (they all seem to have some variation on this theme) and there are even great recipes on the various food websites for the more adventuresome. Your kids may accept these as edible, but why not give them something better?"
61080,B000FA38ZY,A2AM9RQMENY7PQ,11/15/11,0,1,2,Disappointing.,"My Mallomars looked like they were either very old and past their shelf life or (more likely) had been stored in a facility that was too hot or too cold for the cookies. The chocolate looks ashy and is cracked and the cookies taste a little stale. I'll be asking for a refund. Such a bummer, I love these cookies."
61102,B000FA38ZY,A3CIHP9FFPE9I3,11/24/11,1,4,2,Caution: High Fructose Corn Syrup,"I have no idea why an established product such as this would want to send out samples to vine members to review.  That said, the box I got suffered from the lack of sturdy packaging and about half of the cookies were broken and they all had a whitish tinge to the chocolate part that made me think they had been around too long.<br /><br />I am always careful to read labels because I am intolerant of High Fructose Corn Syrup and when I find it on the label as I did in this product I cannot eat it.  I assume that the HFCS is in the marshmallows because all marshmallow products seem to contain it these days.  It amuses me when a product advertises that it has been on the market for over 75 years and yet contains HFCS because this means it is not the original formula by any standards.<br /><br />My 6 year old grandson would not eat these, but my husband ate them so they did not go to waste."
61129,B000FA38ZY,A1437CAM9CNC1E,11/3/11,1,1,2,Disappointed,"I remembered these cookies from when I was a kid and I was really looking forward to getting them. Unfortunately, the cookies arrived broken and the chocolate was white. I'm not sure what the problem was, but they did not taste good. I ate one an threw the box away. They did not taste very good."
61131,B000FA38ZY,AVD27FTJ3Q206,10/25/11,3,4,2,Bad Day At the Factory?,"I have to say I was disappointed with this sample. The cookies were not a pleasing dark chocolate color as one might expect. The chocolate coating was a pale washed out brown color as if they had been subjected to extremes of temperature. The cookie part of the Mallomars was very dry and had started crumbling before I even opened the cellophane package. I do not know if this is typical of other samples sent out but this was certainly neither appealing nor appetizing. The outer packaging arrived in good shape so I do not think the problem was with the mailing. These were not the Mallomars I recalled enjoying from my youth. Based on this sampling, I certainly could not recommend these cookies."

Honestly, I don't know if this is a new formula, if they changed any ingredients, or cut back on using tastier ingredients.  Upon opening this box, I could see that something was amiss.  They weren't as dark as I recall, almost looking aged, or old, although that's really not possible since production only starts up in the fall.  My first bite was also a disappointment.  I couldn't really taste the chocolate, or the marshmallow.  The graham cracker tasted awful and was a lot dryer than I remember.  Some of the cookies were broken and separated from the graham cracker.  I will be purchasing a box locally to see if production has declined or if I just received a bad box.  I'll post back with my findings.<br /><br />EDIT:  Purchased a box yesterday at Shoprite and the first cookie out was mouth watering, as it should be.  Perfect blend of chocolate, marshmallow, & graham crackers that I remember.  This indeed was just a bad box..."

My spouse and I went ahead and each ate one. Well, he ate one. I took one bite and rejected it. The chocolate is too thin and bitter for my taste. The cookie continued to fall apart after one bite. The one bite I had left an awful aftertaste in my mouth. My spouse wasn't impressed either. We will not be purchasing these."

But the marshmallow taste overwhelms the more subtle chocolate, so that I felt at first like I was spooning sugar into my mouth and chewing it. Needless to say, that is not a good taste for me.<br /><br />Before the box was gone, I got more used to the sugar explosion, and the cookies tasted better. But that's not a good thing. Better to avoid this kind of treat. It's not good to like sugar."
61158,B000FA38ZY,AXM71RYI30YOQ,12/16/11,0,0,2,Stale old Mallomars,"I love mallomars, and after moving to the west coast from NYC attempting to find them was disappointing, so I was so excited when I saw them on Amazon.  Unfortunately the ones I got were old and stale (the chocolate had that white film on it) so I was super disappointed.<br /><br />I found them at a few local stores around here so that makes me happy, but I don't think I'll be buying groceries off Amazon again any time soon.  :C"
61165,B000FA38ZY,A1CC1IKCUIQMUV,11/12/11,0,0,2,What a disappointment!,"These cookies were a childhood favorite, so I really looked forward to receiving them.  But the cookies I received had obviously been stored improperly (maybe frozen at some time?)  The chocolate had a dusty bloom, and the tops separated from the graham cracker base at the slightest touch. They are not bad tasting, but certainly didn't live up to expectations!"
61194,B000FA38ZY,A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9,11/1/11,0,0,2,Not as awesome as I'd expected,"I have friends who are raving fans of the Mallomars. I figured they'd be a big hit with me too. After all, there aren't very many junk foods that I don't like. If anything, I have impulse controls issues and have trouble stopping at just one of anything.<br /><br />So I was really surprised when I tried my first Mallomar yesterday. I expected to really have to restrain myself and avoid scarfing down a bunch of them. But no. One was enough. I had no desire to try another. I guess that's lucky for me, because at 60 calories each, these pack quite a payload.<br /><br />Hmmm. Maybe I was in a bad mood or there was a sampling issue. I can't honestly form an opinion on just one, so I tried another one a few hours later and then one more again today.<br /><br />I had the same feeling after every one of them: too much dark chocolate flavor. I like dark chocolate a lot, but these have a surprisingly long lasting dark chocolate aftertaste. The marshmallow inside is really first rate. Marshmallows can get stale and funky pretty easily (except for rock hard Easter peeps!). So yes, they really succeeded with the filling. The cookie was OK, but it didn't hold together very well. It tried to split vertically, which I expected, but it also delaminated horizontally and made a big mess. The cookie taste wasn't as good as I expected. It was fresh and buttery, but there was no sweet flavor or even any graham flavor. It was just a buttery shortbread taste (and messy).<br /><br />And besides the dark chocolate aftertaste, my other lasting impression was that the three tastes (chocolate, marshmallow, and cookie) really didn't marry very well in this treat. They don't combine into a distinct taste like a s'more or a moon pie. They're just three individual tastes. Or actually the marshmallow and the cookie are just delivery systems for the dark chocolate flavor.<br /><br />I've probably really made you mad by now if you're a Mallomar fan. It's fine with me if you like them: different strokes. I wish I could share the rest of my box with you.<br /><br />But if you DO like them, is Amazon the right place to buy them? My box of Mallomars had a pretty rough ride. The chocolate was marred pretty badly and at least one of them was damaged. I don't think the packaging from Nabisco is sufficient for shipping these by UPS or FedEx. I'm sure they do just fine on the regular truck to the grocery store, but freight shipping is a different experience. I'll post a link to a photo so you can see the condition of the contents.<br /><br />It's the cool autumn in Southern California right now, so the contents weren't melted. They would have been badly damaged during the hotter months.<br /><br />So there you have it. It's a treat that a junk food junkie like me can turn his back on. And it's a shopping experience that will probably be disappointing to real fans of this treat. I recommend you pass this item up.<br /><br />Check out the product photo that I posted.  It shows the condition of the cookies when they arrived."

I certainly don't blame the sellers or the products for this unfortunate fact (although they certainly don't volunteer the info), I do blame those who have taken our freedoms to chose what we put in our bodies... thanks all you ""drug warriors"" for restricting what teas I can enjoy.<br /><br />I think many drinkers of these decocainized teas are waking up to the fresh smell of a tasty placebo. Sorry to spoil the party.<br /><br />So: two stars, because it's hard to feel good about paying $75 for what is essentially just green tea... even if it might ""help with digestion"".

61347,B002ZI1J50,A3STVBQLFXRRBX,2/6/11,2,4,2,finally threw it out after poor results.,"I'm a novice with kefir, but very experienced in kitchen and have worked with fermented foods in past.  The biggest problem may have been the sketchy and unclear instructions.<br />I'd heard about letting grains rest after transport, so I did this, leaving them in package at room temperature.  Man of Genius (questionable!) didn't say to put them in milk right  away, so I waited around five days.  He also didn't say anything about proprotions of milk to grains.  I wound up with a vinegary, smelly milk, so foul my partner said it smelled like someone threw up.  I did a lot of reading on the internet, and kept trying, using more milk.  One day I had these little cauliflowers, then they flopped into little bumps on top of the milk.  I bought more grains, this time from Kefir Lady, who sent a generous quarter cup and excellent instructions.  They're growing like  crazy.  I decided today that Man of Genius grains were a waste of milk and tossed the lot down the sink."
61348,B002ZI1J50,A1UG842WNHXLPG,2/28/12,0,1,2,Standard Kefir directions do not work with this product,"When I received this product it came with the wrong directions, but hey, in this modern day the internet can fix this situation... except that it can't. I tried several you tube videos, many blogs, they all seemed to have the same directions for milk kefir grains. These directions did not work for my purchased grains, and I did try a number of times. I gave up because who really has the time to trouble shoot something that should be very simple.<br /><br />After being contacted by the seller (who seems concerned and helpful) I learned that with this product you really have to let the seller guild you through the process, hold your hand, because their grains are just that much more potent then anyone elses. Also, you shouldn't expect to be able to drink more then 1/2 a cup every week or two because these grains are just that potent.... of course after 4 rounds in milk my grains didn't grow... so maybe mine weren't that potent.<br /><br />In the end I didn't have a lot of time to commit to dealing with Lifetime Kefir. If you want yummy digestible kefir instead of milk in your smoothies and on your granola DO NOT BUY THIS, buy another product, with instructions, that seems to match other's opinions of what kefir's potency should be for someone who enjoys it.<br /><br />But if you do have the time and you don't like to drink a lot of Kefir but want the benefits this is PERFECT for you. The seller is very responsive and helpful and very concerned with your happiness. But you do have to take the time to have a conversation over email instead of just looking up the solution yourself."

When I first opened the bag, I was struck by the very dark appearance of the beans and a burnt odor.  I was skeptical that I would care for this coffee at this point, but decided to try it anyway.  Unfortunately, my fears were confirmed when I actually tasted the coffee -- first black and then with sweetener and milk.  The bitter, burnt taste was very pronounced and this was at less than half the recommended brew strength, i.e., 3 level tablespoons for 8 cups.

From the beginning, it took buying 5 collars before I could get 3 that worked. The collar radios are cheaply made, they fall apart. The nylon collars themselves easily come unravelled and are virtually impossible to find replacements.<br /><br />The door itself worked perfectly for 6 1/2 months. Then it began sticking in the open position. I have reached out the manufacturer several times, but have NEVER received a response. After reading their website FAQ, I decide to replace the motor assembly. This requires completely removing the door from the wall, removing no less than 28 different screws, prying the fly wheel from the old motor, attaching the new motor assembly to the fly wheel. Next, I wanted to test the new assembly, but you can't set the door upright without reinserting the majority of screws. Thankfully, the door worked perfectly. I reattached the back completely, then reattached the door to the wall... All for the tidy sum of 90.00 with shipping.<br /><br />One week later the door began sticking again. I contacted the company again... Still no response... The symptoms this time were a bit different. The door opens, then attempts to close 5-6 times, before successfully closing... AND this only happens as the day goes on... Not early in the morning or after several hours of non-use... I re-read the company website FAQ... They suggested replacing the motor assembly AND motherboard... After several days of no response from the company, I was getting desperate. So I ordered the motherboard... 60.00 later, the door is still acting the exact same way... Working perfectly in the morning, but sticking as the day wears on...

I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry.

The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected.

The excitement ended after the first bite.  It was dry, chalky, and not very chocolatey, not mention that I didn't detect any almonds in the bar.  It wasn't terrible, but also just wasn't very good.  If these bars were just stacked with proteins and vitamins, I might buy more. However, there are better tasting alternatives out there that have superior nutritional value.<br /><br />I would pass on these."

However, once that first bite was in my mouth it's evident it was not. The chocolate in these bards over powers the taste of anything else. Like I said, I'm a chocolate fan but this was just too potent of chocolate for my tastes.<br /><br />Since there were a dozen in the box I decided to let a few others try them. It was a mixed bag of results there too. One person took one bite and would have no more. One said they were okay with coffee. One person ate an entire bar before deeming it ""not very good"". The last person really liked them and said he would buy them in a store. So, basically 1 out of 5 people in my highly unscientific research liked them.<br /><br />I guess if you are a dark chocolate person these may be something you'll like.

It's nice that they're vegan, kosher and have lots of fiber, but the sad, sad thing is, I just don't like them and can't imagine myself eating them. If I had to eat them, I would. You know, if I was little and my mother made me, like parents used to make their kids swallow cod liver oil all those years ago. Well, these bars aren't that bad, but they don't taste very good, to me anyway. I see others have liked them and I suppose taste is subjective, so please take this review with a grain of salt."

And some aren't too bad for ease of preparation.<br /><br />This one isn't easily doctored, nor is it that fast/simple to make. Therefore I don't see any reason to keep in the pantry.

Does anyone have any tips or know what I did wrong?<br /><br />The aroma and flavor is fantastic. You'll never miss the fat, but watch the calorie count - it's still pretty high. Don't fool yourself into eating the whole pan.<br /><br />I later tried much cheaper Duncan Hines and substituted pineapple (puree'd) for oil.  While not at tasty as 'No pudge' brand, it baked on schedule and tasted nice. Substituting pineapple seemed to give it a slightly more cake-like texture."

Admittedly, just how salty is ""too salty"" is a highly subjective thing, and some others obviously like this rub quite a lot. But looking at the nutrition info on the label, the sodium content in this rub is substantially higher than most other commercial rubs/seasons I've tried. So just be forewarned that if your salt preference is more on the conservative side, this may not be the product for you."
63067,B000QV4U4U,A1PSGON1Z4FF4B,6/6/12,7,7,2,Beware of the good reviews this is a very salty rub,I bought this product due to all the good reviews.  I bbq using a weber smokey mountain often.  I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.

Well, if mozzarella were dry, crispy, and charged with a faint chemical aftertaste, then I would say, sure. Kinda. I guess. But no, they do not taste like mozzarella in the way that regular Cheez-its taste like cheddar. I think this is because cheddar at its best is dry, sharp, and a little grainy.

I think illy's canned cappuccino drink tastes much better.  But I guess if you're a serious coffee drinker, having an espresso on the go like this would be a good thing.

I am a coffee lover and enthusiast, so I'm married to the idea of buying a can or bottle of a delicious coffee based product that I'll live happily ever after with. My experiences, however, have yet to yield bliss. Some are just fine, but nothing has ever made me say ""Wow! I'd like to drink this all the time!"" I had heard some positive things about the illy issimo brand, so given the opportunity--I sampled both their Caffe and their Cappuccino.<br /><br />Caffe (2 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink. At first, I thought this drink had a strong and pronounced coffee flavor. But something is slightly off. The more I drank, it seemed too sweet and too bitter at once, which is a strange and not altogether pleasant combination. As it is essentially comparable to drinking an iced espresso, it may not be as palatable as some of their other creations. But, it's not really something that I would sample again. And at an approximate cost of $2.00 per can (only 6.8 ounce), this serves more as a caffeine boost than a refreshing beverage. Made with real Arabica coffee, I was also intrigued by the ""Do Not Shake"" warning which left me with the unappetizing visual of the particulate matter that must still be in the liquid drink (fine for Turkish coffee, not so appealing for something in a can).<br /><br />Cappucino (3 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Espresso Style Coffee Drink with Lowfat Milk and Cocoa. So, at 8.45 ounces this is a slightly bigger drink. As some of the harshness is buffered by the milk and cocoa combination, this one easily had a more pleasant taste. Still, a bit sweet for my liking but better overall. I'm still not blown away and I won't be a regular purchaser of this, or any illi issimo brand drinks, but I didn't dislike this one. Nice enough once in a while, but not inspiring enough to purchase a case. I guess I'll remain a fresh made kind of coffee drinker! KGHarris, 6/12."

I couldn't even finish one can, and then I offered it to my husband; he couldn't finish it either.<br /><br />We love fresh brewed coffee, and we've become coffee snobs recently, not caring for Starbucks and other chain coffees like we used to.

Iam not sure why.  I had put the can in my refrigerator to chill it for several hours.<br /><br />Each can is 6.8 fl ounces, which is one serving, has 50 calories, total carbs-12 grams, sugars-10 grams, and 155 milligrams of caffeine.  On the caffeine scale I have no idea how high that caffeine level is on a scale from low to high, but by my taste buds I would say it ranges on the higher side due to the STRONG coffee taste that this has, at least to me.<br /><br />I did not find this Caffe Italian Expresso Style Coffee Drink to be sweet at all.  All I tasted was a STRONG coffee flavor, no other flavor was pronounced.<br /><br />That may be because it's an expresso type drink.  Expresso is always a stronger coffee.<br /><br />I do know this, and that is I couldn't drink more than a few sips of this drink out of the can, just the way it is.<br /><br />It's just way too strong for me, but I think if I put it into a taller glass, add some ice and some flavored liquid creamer, it would taste much better to me.<br /><br />For those of you who love STRONG coffee beverages, you may just love this one!<br /><br />To me it packs a real coffee punch for a can of this size!"

63401,B002IEZJMA,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,5/23/12,0,0,2,"An ""Energy Beverage"" canned by Coca Cola - It's not good","I have come to expect Illy coffee to symbolize good and consistent quality. I do prefer other brands of espresso, but Illy's consistency is great since it is to be found in many restaurants around the globe.<br /><br />So it is with some sadness that I write a negative review. First off - please note that this is actually a coffee flavored energy beverage made and packaged by Coca Cola. Illy has partnered in order to take proceeds by allowing their name to be used. There might be a some of their coffee used, but it would be processed coffee extract, and so there wouldn't be much reason to use expensive Arabica coffee when extract from lower quality Robusto would work.<br /><br />This canned beverage seems to taste pleasant enough at first, but then it starts to turn metallic. The coffee flavor really is a 'coffee flavor'. There is just something artificial and chemical tasting about this drink. Granted, it's only 45 calories, most coming from the beet extract sweetener.  And don't be fooled by beet sweetener, it's really no different than any other unbleached sugar.  It is regularly used to Chaptalize wine in fact.  Don't be lured in by the low calorie claim: fresh brewed iced coffee without sweetener? Zero calories. Yes. Zero. (okay, actually 0.01 calories! sorry!) So it's not like they're really doing anything crazy by offering this at 45 calories.  It's just less sugar added than the super sweet beverages.  Really it seems the sweetener was added to try and mask the artificial and metallic flavor.<br /><br />There are better iced coffees on the market.  I hope we really start to see some more variety and availability soon.  Other countries like Japan have a huge market for bottled and canned unsweetened tea and coffee, so hopefully we can get on the bandwagon soon.  Hopefully with better tasting results."
63402,B002IEZJMA,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,5/17/12,0,0,2,What is this product supposed to be?,"I do not buy coffee because I need a burst of energy or alertness because caffeine does not have a significant effect upon me.  I buy coffee because I like coffee and the stronger, bolder tasting coffees appeal to me the most.  I also do not appreciate coffees that derive their stronger flavor by over burning the beans during roasting.  I like strong coffees that get their stronger taste from significantly lower water content during brewing.  All other things being equal, this high coffee to water ratio gives a fuller flavor, but at a higher cost.  If money were an issue, I would rather have fewer cups of fuller tasting coffee than many more cups of weaker, less full bodied coffee.  This Illy Italian style espresso meets none of the requirements of a good cup of coffee except that it is made from Arabica beans which tend to be less acidic, smoother and fuller bodied.  However, there are some Arabica beans that are better than others and Arabica beans are no guarantee of a good cup of coffee.<br /><br /> I would only drink this coffee under conditions of extreme thirst.  I believe this can of espresso ""tasting"" coffee compromises on so many elements of good tasting coffee such that I would not want to drink it again.  First, the espresso is weak and it probably derives whatever taste it has by over burning the beans at roasting giving it a bitter taste as opposed to a bold taste.  I know that burning the beans somewhat gives espresso its flavor by releasing more oil from the beans which allows for a frothier and smoother coffee when brewed at higher pressures.  This Illy espresso did release some additional oil, but the taste was not bold because too little coffee was used in brewing.  This does not make Italian style espresso, it makes a weak espresso with a hint of burned coffee beans that I doubt that espresso drinkers will find appealing.  Also, this espresso style coffee has a taste that cannot be described as coffee-like.  If anything it has a chemical like bitter taste that is almost sweet.  Overall, it leaves a bitter and unidentifiable taste.  Perhaps some of the metallic taste from the can has impacted the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />I do not know what this product attempts to be because of all of the compromises concerning its taste, its strength, its name, its market and its price, most of which seem to be contradictory.  I think Illy needs to go back to the drawing board to list what qualities they are trying to produce and see if that is possible in the market.  Otherwise they seem to have met none and made a product that I believe satisfies few.<br /><br />Lastly, the qualities of coffee are varied and thus a matter of personal preference.  I have noticed that those who do not really appreciate a good cup of coffee tend to classify coffee into two categories that are sufficient for them.  Those categories simply classify coffee into those that are weak or strong, modified by too weak or too strong.  I suspect that these adjectives are sufficient for a majority and tend to simplify life by not seeking the cup of coffee that is just right.  Of course, such people would use time saved on the search for truly satisfying coffee by substituting wine for coffee or colors of paint on their walls.  It seems that everyone has their specialty product of which they are aficionados.  For kids it might be cereal for blue collar workers it may be beer.  It makes one wonder if writing a review has already been done on a non-published basis for virtually all products where a choice exists.  To summarize, I don't like Illy espresso drink but I do like a fresh Guinness Draft even though I am retired."

The drink had that stale, ""I've been sitting for a while"" coffee taste that is best poured down a drain. The sweetness is about right (not cloying or overpowering) and it definitely tastes like espresso, but it just doesn't taste like fresh brewed (maybe yesterday). I know it comes in a can and technically can't be fresh, but I've tasted similar coffee drinks that didn't have that stale, skunky taste.

I have tried Starbucks drinks both at Starbucks coffee shops and from the supermarket.  I like them.  This drink is not as sweet.  It seems there's just enough sugar to take the bitter edge off.  When ice is added it makes a refreshing enough warm weather beverage, though I have tasted better.  What the product has going for it is convenience.  The 6.8-ounce cans are easy to store in the refrigerator and can be taken out and drunk quickly.  No process of first making iced coffee.  That's a definite plus.  It is not as satisfying at room temperature.<br /><br />The flavor, apart from being strong, is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a Starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can/bottle do.  As a pick-me-up, the drink is appropriate, since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy.  Compared to other similar drinks on the market, sugar content is low (which accounts for its bitterness).<br /><br />For those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed coffee, this beverage is a no-no.  These days, many folks have cut down on caffeine intake, so this product might be counterproductive to weaning oneself from addictive caffeine."

It has a very strong flavor, which many have praised saying that it is very close to the flavor of an espresso, but for me there is a bitter aftertaste that I can't ignore.  The colder you drink this, the stronger the aftertaste and so I found that letting it get closer to room temperature (slightly cooler, but not much) helped make this a more satisfying `sip'.

It's nothing like the real thing over ice, even though I drank it well chilled.  I don't think I could have drank it at all any other way.

The taste is mild and their is little aroma.  The aftertaste is unpleasant and otherwise the drink tastes like coffee that has sat out for a while.

Anyway, this drink met with negative results, here - too sweet and rich, but, it would be best to judge for yourself or look at several reviews. For me, not being a regular coffee drinker, I prefer a cold Coca Cola or iced tea, rather than any iced coffee drink anytime. Plus, at about $2 for a can, too expensive for me - but I'm a cheapskate, so keep that in mind."
63625,B002IEZJMA,A3VI2VETB90ZG5,6/3/12,0,1,2,I Dislike It,"Generally, I love coffee. I prefer hot coffee made from fresh ground beans and I drink it black. I've tried many of both iced coffee beverages and coffees with espresso shots from the big chain, and I've found them completely delightful, though expensive. Unfortunately, this canned, low-calorie Italian espresso style coffee drink is a no-go for me.<br /><br />I'm assuming this is to be served cool from the refrigerator, although I'm certain my reaction wouldn't be any different had I drank it at room temperature. The texture is unsatisfactorily grainy. The flavor is unpleasantly off, either from beans that aren't bold enough or from a mixture of ingredients that ruins the flavor of a good bean - either way, I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />It's a 50 calorie beverage; with a low 20mg sodium and 12g in carbs, so it balances out nutritionally for a coffee drink. The beet sugar is where it gets its 4g of fiber, its 10g of sugars and likely the peculiar graininess.<br /><br />This is a convenient on-the-go option for someone who likes coffee, but I like coffee, and I do not like this."
63626,B002IEZJMA,A2MUGFV2TDQ47K,6/3/12,0,1,2,"Thanks, But I'll Pass","I sampled this product and was not impressed. It took me several sittings to make it through this can. It's metallic, bitter and not a pleasant caffeine beverage. Although NOT a coffee connoisseur, I suspect one would better appreciate the bold bite this beverage delivers. I'm not sure if this was the only coffee available I'd choose it again. There are better tasting options available and also at better price-points."
63627,B002IEZJMA,A2BN9DIBP9A0XG,6/3/12,0,1,2,"Yea, not so much.","This is the first canned coffee I've tried. I found it to be a major disappointment. It was very bitter. I know other reviewers have said it was sweet. I certainly could not taste any sweetness at all. There was a definite metallic edge that I did not enjoy. We poured it into several glasses and had a panel of judges try it, all of whom love their coffee. Not one person finished it. ""Ick!"" was the overwhelming response."
63628,B002IEZJMA,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,6/3/12,0,1,2,Bitter - Not Sweet and It Has 10 grams of Sugar,"The ingredients in this product are: coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate. It has 10 grams of sugar. Note this does not have a dairy product ingredient in it.<br /><br />This is a thin consistency drink with a bold bitter coffee taste. I detect no sweetness at all, although it has 10 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I like the taste of bold coffee with french roast or cofee and chickory New Orleans style or Vietnamese style coffee drinks. This was bold and strong but a thin consistency and bitter despite the sugar added.<br /><br />This drink did nothing for me. I prefer a real cup of hot coffee with half and half to give it a creamy consistency, or I like a strong coffee iced coffee drink or I like an espresso based coffee drink or a frozen Frappuccino type of drink. I love strong coffee that's bold. I usually only use one sugar in a large coffee so I don't like it super-sweet by any means. This is just bitter and I rate it 2 stars = I Don't Like It.<br /><br />There are other iced canned or iced bottled prepared coffee drinks, milk or no milk products that I prefer the taste of such as the ones made by Starbucks (i.e. glass bottled Frappuccino) or the little aluminum cans of espresso drinks such as Starbucks DoubleShot."
63671,B002IEZJMA,A1ITRGMT80D5TK,3/30/12,0,1,2,Very strong...didn't care for it...,"I've had the Cappuccino flavor of this drink and I absolutely loved it.  I'm not huge on this flavor.  It's very strong and I don't taste much sweetness.  It was a bit overpowering for my tastes.<br /><br />The Cappuccino flavored can was 8.45 oz which I thought was a bit small but this flavor is even smaller at 6.8 oz.<br /><br />Although I like the simpleness of have a ready-made coffee drink, I think I'll stick to the Cappuccino ones."
63672,B002IEZJMA,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,3/29/12,0,1,2,Incredibly mediocre,"Coffee drinks aren't carbonated, so it's odd that I would describe this drink as being ""flat."" But that's how it tasted, like a ""flat"" carbonated drink. Probably one of the worst coffee drinks I've ever had in my life. I will definitely NOT be drinking more of this."
63674,B002IEZJMA,ABMX8XUNPR3LP,3/26/12,0,1,2,Not for casual coffee drinkers,"Perhaps it's just something about the area I live in, but our convenience stores sell many brands of coffee ""shot"" drinks and all of them have some sort of cream in them to cut the bitter taste of pure espresso. That being said, I was unpleasantly surprised when I took a sip of illy issimo Caffe. It was pure, undiluted cold coffee. And unlike some other reviewers, I couldn't taste the sweetener at all.<br /><br />This is the first quickie cold coffee drink that I haven't completely enjoyed. I just couldn't drink it, but my reasons for disliking it are probably the exact reasons black coffee and straight espresso drinkers will love it. Those who like their iced coffees light and sweet and their Frappuchinos heavy on the extras should steer clear of illy issimo Caffe."
63675,B002IEZJMA,A1BXVZSQOJE6UE,3/26/12,0,1,2,Basically An Expensive Cup Of Bitter Coffee,"Apparently illy issimo is a well-known brand of coffee in Italy.  I don't know if they had a hard time turning their product into a canned drink, but color me unimpressed by illy.  I chilled the product because I felt that it would be better than drinking it lukewarm.  I don't think it would have mattered as all I tasted was a cold cup of your standard cheap grocery store brand coffee.  Even my wife who drinks much more coffee than I disliked it.  It wasn't that it had a rich, strong capuccino taste which I actually like - the coffee tasted bitter, had a strange after taste, and would have needed ALOT of sweetener for it to be even marginally palatable.  I drank about half of the can and then had to pour the rest out (and drink a big glass of water to wash the taste out of my mouth).  An overall unpleasant experience..."
63677,B002IEZJMA,A1ALOTXWL76OY7,3/22/12,0,1,2,Too Strong for me,I like Coffee but this espresso coffee drink was too strong for me.  It was sweet and the label said it could contain milk but it was so strong it definitely didn't taste like it was diluted with milk... I didn't make through a 1/4 of the pretty small can.
63693,B002IEZJMA,A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,6/19/12,1,3,2,"Too bitter for my taste, not what I expected of a chilled coffee","The illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-oz is a little too bitter for my taste and frankly, not what I expected of a chilled coffee. Even with 10mg of sugar in it, the bitter after taste still lingers. To taper it down, I actually added a bit more cream and sugar to it and that made it more bearable. This being a canned variety, it is obviously geared for on-the-go people and for those who just plainly love espresso. It is also on the pricey side and this is not something I would be drinking on a daily basis."
63695,B002IEZJMA,AVPNQUVZWMDSX,6/16/12,1,3,2,Have a fresh cup of espresso instead,"I don't really know who Illy's marketing group was targeting when they came up with the idea for this drink, but I know one thing: It wasn't me. This miniature can contains a coffee that Illy should feel ashamed to put its name on. Taste is subpar and artificial, and it's pre-sweetened -- a lot. Pass."
63701,B002IEZJMA,A2GK5S3ZF9Y8YO,6/14/12,1,3,2,Way too bitter,"I liked <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> very much, so I expected to like this product just as well. I was wrong. It is way too bitter--I couldn't taste even a hint of sweetness, though there is sugar in it. And there's a strong aftertaste, as well. It does pack quite the caffeine punch, though, so I have to give it props for that. Still, there is no chance I'll be purchasing this product."
63710,B002IEZJMA,A1N5FSCYN4796F,5/30/12,1,3,2,Bad Tasting Caffeine Boost,"I enjoy trying new drinks, and I also like coffee and espresso drinks.  So I was curious about the Caffe coffee drink from Illy Issimo.  However, I was a little disappointed in the result.  The taste started sweet, transitioned to citrus, and finished bitter.  I found that the added sugar masked any potential nuance from the coffee without providing any real desirable flavor of its own.  While not necessarily bad, the Caffe (6.8 oz, 50 calories, 155 mg caffeine) does not compare favorably with a tall Starbucks Iced Coffee (12 oz, 60 calories, 120 mg caffeine).  If you are looking for a compact shot of caffeine, this might be what you want.  However, don't expect much in the taste department.  I am hoping that the Cappuccino fares better."
63711,B002IEZJMA,A23RZIU0N8K2KR,3/31/12,1,3,2,Ily Cappuccino taste better,"This coffee is very bitter with a strong bold taste. Heating it up (if you like your drink warm) makes it more bitter.<br /><br />It has a strong coffee aroma, and its not too sweet. I could only take a couple of sips of it, and this 1 can lasted me 2-3 days because I wasn't enamored with the flavor. If you like tasty coffee, illy Cappuccino is a lot better. I felt this product has more of a caffeine punch that the Starbucks double shot cans.<br /><br />I didn't find anything special with this drink (and to be perfectly honest, it made me kind of nauseous on a empty stomach). It also increase my acid reflux just a bit. Will not be ordering in the future."
63712,B002IEZJMA,A3NLJZI5NEOT0K,3/25/12,1,3,2,Where's the coffee?,"Illy is a top coffee brand in Italy, so I was very interested in trying their pre-packaged espresso. This drink is also pre-sweetened. It was quite a disappointment to take a sip and find that there was absolutely no flavor of coffee at all. And espresso's supposed to be pretty strong. The only taste was that of the sweetener, of which there was far too much. I'll continue to make expresso at home, grinding the beans and using my little stove top pot."
63713,B002IEZJMA,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,6/14/12,2,5,2,"Got this for the wife, she hated it","My wife is a coffee drinker, I am not so I got this for her to try and her immediate impressions, it was terrible. She tried another of the illy issimo drinks and felt that tasted watered down, this however was strong but the taste was terrible. Now taste is all subjective so while she hated it you may like it. That being said she does love the starbucks drinks you can buy and this was not on-par with the taste of those according to her. I believe if she wants canned coffee in the future we'll be staying away from this brand."
63722,B002IEZJMA,A194K60CWZ371J,6/6/12,0,2,2,It Just Wasn't For Me,"I found this drink to be bitter, sharp, and almost flavorless. I was very surprised after really liking another flavor in this brand (Maybe I got a bad can?). I even had my husband try it to share his thoughts and he like I was not a fan either. It's a shame because of all the nutritional benefits and convenience of taking along this drink with you."

Then, the after-taste kicked in, and I did not like it.  It gave a very ""tinny"" taste in my mouth, like a tin lining taste that made it taste like a canned coffee drink.  Personally, I'd rather drink day-old coffee because at least it tastes like coffee.  This is the second illy product I tasted, both of which completely underwhelmed my senses.  Just meh."
63755,B002IEZJMA,AM8J1UVGVYAL4,7/17/12,0,0,2,Did not like the taste ... strong with a bitter bite.,"I did not like the taste of this canned coffee.  It had a very strong, bitter bite.  I took two sips and could not drink anymore.  My husband (who loves about anything coffee) said that he didn't really like it either, but then he polished off the can.  This is definitely a personal taste item."

Drinking yesterday's coffee left in the pot without reheating it would be equally satisfying as  this canned beverage.  Didn't enjoy the flavor nor did I find it refreshing in any way.  I'm glad my Vine sample was only one can!

I thought espresso was suppose to have a lot of caffiene so I expected an energy boost but instead I took a nap 2 hours later..... I guess if you like espresso and that strong taste you'll like this but I didn't and I tried it on ice and hot.

This is bad cold iced coffee with a somewhat synthetic chemical like taste.  Provides caffeine if that's what you are looking for but the taste is somewhat horrible.

I filled a glass with ice and poured it over. Looked good until I tasted the first sip. I don't even know how to describe it. Strong for sure and like a bit a sweet was hiding in the background. So I tried adding some splenda to see if that would help, mmmm, just a tad. So I tried some soy milk which I like the taste of, nope not an improvement.<br /><br />Overall it seemed acidic to me and mostly unpleasant. I was unable to drink more than a few sips. Maybe the latte variety would be more to my taste, this not so much."
63782,B002IEZJMA,A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,7/10/12,0,0,2,"Very strange, off taste, somewhat acidic","There is something very odd with the sweetener in this drink, I think. It tastes at first like strong black coffee, almost burnt, with some sugar and no cream added to it. Quickly, however, a really strange acidity overwhelms the rest of the taste. It's a little like that cheap liquid ""diet"" sweetener from the 1970s, which tasted like chemicals if you had it by itself.  It would probably be okay in this coffee if the coffee itself didn't taste burned, or if it balanced with more cream-type taste.  In fact, I finished the rest of the can I had by mixing it in with about 2 ounces of pre-made iced coffee in a carton, and that made a huge difference.<br /><br />I drink coffee daily and really enjoy other illy issimo products.

However, for people who like cold black coffee, this is probably a very refreshing drink. For a generation brought up on super-sweet flavored and whip-cream-topped coffee concoctions, I doubt this will be a hit. Unless they use it as a challenge, like eating a teaspoon of cinnamon, or drinking Sriracha sauce straight from the bottle."

Illy happens to be one of my favorite brands for making lattes and cappuccinos, so I felt pretty confident that this drink would be good.  I was half right.  This may be one of the oddest things I've drunk yet.<br /><br />At the first sip, it tasted like lightly sweetened, fairly strong espresso, but there was something off.  I took another sip, trying to figure out what it was, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.<br /><br />I decided to try pouring it into a glass to see if this alleviated the strangeness.  I took another sip and, yep, still strange.  It took me a while to realize that the strangeness was that it seemed almost like it was carbonated, yet it didn't fizz.  This made no sense to me, so I checked the label to find that potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate are two of the ingredients.  Bingo.  My guess is these ingredients are conspiring to give this coffee a strange, difficult to describe aftertaste.<br /><br />Ultimately, this ruined the beverage for me.  Even though I liked the taste of the coffee and thought it had just the right level of sweetness, I couldn't get past that weird tang and vaguely fizzy feeling.  I won't be coming back for more of this."

It takes a lot of grounds to brew a cup that has any flavor at all. I generally enjoy light and medium roasts, and when this is brewed correctly there is a decent if unremarkable flavor. But I have to pack the filter to get any taste at all. I do appreciate the lower caffeine content, as I generally enjoy an extra cup of coffee in the afternoon.

64236,B000KKQNJM,A38I1BYG4G9CLR,11/28/09,0,0,2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this $49.99 Gingerbread house kit at the deeply discounted price of $19.99.  I wish I had not paid more than $10.  When it arrived, it was broken in several places, and the candy canes were smashed.  I realize anything can happen during shipping, but it could have been packaged more safely. In addition, the house was much smaller than I had expected for the price. The sides of the house are no larger than graham crackers at the most. The biggest issue I had was with the icing.  The instructions say to knead it to soften it for use. I kneaded, and kneaded, and finally resorted to running it under hot water to try to get it soft enough to use.  Every few minutes I would have to run under hot water again, or else the icing would be way too hard to be able to squeeze.  There is not nearly enough icing included in order to decorate the house as it is shown in the picture.  My son and I made our own patterns as best we could, and ended up laughing about it and simply eating the house unfinished.  We had an enjoyable time, but that was due to our laughter at how horrible this kit was.  I would not recommend this kit. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the ginger bread was actually delicious."

When I opened the UPS package, the handle to the gingerbread box was broken. The box was also dented in places. The taste of the icing was horrible.

I like to have a mix of hard candies for them so they can choose for themselves. Cherryfield Candy sent this product very fast... very good response to my order. Wrappings are cute, easy to open, nice sized small drop. But the one thing missing is the coffee taste. It's almost tasteless. My problem, I guess, is that I'm comparing it to another more expensive heavily-coffee-flavored larger hard candy. From the good price, I thought these might be smaller items, but with an equally strong coffee taste. I was wrong. I liked Cherryfield's service, but do not care for this product; I will not order these candies again. Out of 5 possible stars, I would give this product a 2 1/2."
64253,B000HDJZMO,AQQVDHF275MVR,5/13/10,0,1,2,not my taste,"I bought this so that I could get food in my dorm room that isn't ramen, and I had had good experiences with this brand. I couldn't even finish two of these because it was so disgusting that I couldn't stomach it. I had to give the rest to one of my friends so that it wouldn't go to waste. He didn't really like it either, but he ate it so that he wouldn't waste it. I wouldn't even consider buying this again."

The fryer never worked out of the box. I returned it a few days later. We ended up baking the turkey in the oven. He had injected it already with this seasoning kit, according to directions on the package.  Now I don't know if it would have tasted differently fried rather than baked, but it was horrible.<br />We ended up throwing the turkey out.  It was inedible. Fortunately I am the mother of an Eagle Scout and I am always prepared with a Plan B.  I purchased a glazed ham the same time I purchased the turkey.  Christmas dinner was saved.  So I don't know whether it was baking the bird that made the difference or what, but beware if you don't fry your turkey."

64313,B001EO5YAC,A38A0J58OIBJ1C,5/9/10,1,1,2,Mediocre,"This coffee tastes weak and old. Cream is very thin. I don't know the roast date, but it still had about year and half to expiration date. This is strange by itself- top quality coffee is good for about 1 month after the roast. It can survive longer, when beans are  packed in a nitrogen filled sealed container, but this coffee came in a regular valved bag. The beans are well roasted, not burned, maybe they'd tasted better when fresh.<br />Gave it 2 stars because it is still better than a cheap coffee from a supermarket, which I consider 1 star benchmark."
64314,B001EO5YAC,ABK9YZIUN5RMQ,2/24/10,1,1,2,It was very weak and barely drinkable in my opinion,"This was my first time with Lavazza. The coffee was weak, light, flavor was OK but not what I was expecting from an Italian coffee. With the milk (cappuccino) it was barely present as taste.<br />I drink cappuccinos every day and I use a very good espresso machine and I can change the type of grind, and the strength and all that. No matter what combination I used it was just barely Ok.<br />If I could I would have returned the coffee."

The underlying flavor is has some of the distinctive notes from 'real' lavazza, but that really doesn't compensate for the under-roasting."
64344,B001EO5YAC,A2HBCRDH410E7L,2/6/07,5,9,2,Not best for espresso beverages,The roast is a light medium.  Tried various grinds with my WEGA espresso machine.  Does not have the body and character to make a good espresso beverage.  Look for a darker roast.  Makes a pretty good drip.

64369,B003JMC5MC,AG9QYXPY02TK6,12/20/10,2,11,2,Froot Loops + Funeral Home,"I have to agree with the first reviewer on this. While I'm generally not a fan of fruity or floral teas, I love rose in tea. When I first opened the bag, I almost gagged at the overpowering aroma of citrus and florals - although tazo uses natural ingredients, it seemed almost synthetic. Luckily, the tea (unsweetened and brewed as suggested) does not taste nearly as strong as it smells. Still, I couldn't get past the fact that it smelled overwhelmingly like a funeral home / aunt gertrude's perfume while tasting like a bowl of froot loops.<br /><br />I suppose I had hoped for a more neutral base with subtle accents of flavor. If you don't mind in your face citrus and florals, then you will probably enjoy this tea."
64383,B005UHKA58,A281TKDEPS1EYM,1/16/12,1,1,2,"Ehh, good gummies, but you don't get much.","First off, you can get these 3.5 oz boxes from your local ""Wally-World"" for 99cents each. So, Amazon is obviously making a killing off of these boxes.  The amount of gummies in the box is deceiving.  The box is extremely big compared to the bag holding the gummies.  I'd rather buy the Angry Bird Fruit Snacks, not sure if I can find them somewhere else .. other than on here.  $7 a box of fruit snacks is pretty ridiculous."
64417,B000MIDROQ,A1XRXZI5KOMVDD,4/24/11,2,3,2,Not as good as the ravioli,"I bought these thinking that they would be as good as the ravioli. Wrong.  There is something different and unpleasant about the sauce.  The tiny meatballs weren't bad but something was ""off"" with the sauce, plus there was way too much sauce to spaghetti. Not sure if this was just a bad shipment or if they always taste like this.  I'll stick with the ravioli in the future."
64435,B001IZM8Y2,A2I62XGIKNK1EP,8/7/09,4,5,2,poor quality for the price,I've tried many different brands of dried fruit and this one was one of the poorest quality.  More than 1/2 of the slices in the package have seeds and they don't come off easily. I either had to cut or bite off the pieces with seeds.  Definitely not worth the money. Some of the other brands on here with individually packaged fruit might be more costly per pound but are much better quality.
64486,B001BM4NWM,A3EOUTANX93J7L,5/3/12,0,0,2,Major Dents in Cans,"I love this soup for my children, but I'm not sure about ordering it online anymore.  8 of the 12 cans had major dents.  I mean 2 to 3 INCH dents that were 1/4 inch deep.  This is unacceptable quality.  Since the price has gone up drastically since I started ordering online a few years ago, I will now go to the store and pay the same price for undented cans."
64490,B001BM4NWM,A29IZU11KYP3EF,3/3/11,0,0,2,Difficult for a child to chew,"The overall flavor in this soup is not bad, however it's extremely difficult to chew.<br />When my daughter tried to chew it, she seemed to be having problems so then she kept<br />trying to swallow it, and continued to choke each time. I had a few bites myself, and<br />I found that even I had difficulty chewing the beans--they were SO HARD! For a toddler<br />to eat this was next to impossible. I definitely wont ever buy this again and wouldn't<br />recommend it for a child or an adult."
64526,B001LQTHWY,ANL27D208H6YW,8/18/12,0,0,2,Not so good...,"I had high hopes for these pods as I am on a continual quest for a strong decaf coffee pod that will work in my Senseo.  I've been through them all it seems, until I came across this one when reordering through Amazon recently.  Unfortunately, these missed the mark considerably. They are a poor match for the Senseo which tends to either pour water through them too fast or pool water in the pod around them, which results in coffee that resembles tea or colored water.  Don't know what to do with the three boxes I bought.  Maybe Amazon will take them back, or I can break them open and utilize them with my espresso machine? Nonetheless, I've spent enough time trying to find a worthwhile decaf pod; I'm now going to buy a Coffeeduck and allow myself to have a decent cup of coffee with my Senseo and a premium ground decaf of my choice and liking."
64533,B002K98IWG,A1UGMVAYGDS02C,2/15/11,1,1,2,To much (fake) butter,"Just made this today. I didn't like the smell of the mix right from the box yet I went ahead and wasted my time, electricity and ingredients.  The smell is overpowering on the butter and not real butter but fake butter.  Not sure what it would have been like if I used oil instead of margarine. I think it was the fake butter that made the mix bad.  I love Pillsbury but this version is terrible.  Bought it by accident.  Hope that doesn't happen again."

The 8 cans were shrinkwrapped, and then packaged in a larger box with really big air packs (like giant bubbles from bubble wrap) around them.  Obviously, when they arrived, there was just some plastic...nothing to stop the cans from jumbling around in the box.  How someone would think that an air pack could cushion a 10+ pound set of cans without popping is beyond me.  Again, Amazon is sending replacements...hoping these aren't all dented :)"

I added a bit of nutmeg and a bit of cinnamon to it, and only then was it good tasting. Another reviewer said it tasted like pepper, and, that reviewer was correct. It was very peppery until I added the other two spices to it."
64699,B00348MFQW,A26XQWSHPGFAEV,1/4/11,2,3,2,Not as good as it used to be,"This is distinctly different than Gold Label Gran Riserva! While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great. We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva Gold Label and it was amazing. This vinegar is much sharper and thinner. It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva. The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no.<br />According to one of the vendors, all that was changed was the label.  They told me that ""the year denotation of '12 years' had to be taken off of the bottle"" and ""the label had to be changed because of Italian government regulation."" The vendor and Fattoria Estense are saying the new Gold Label 'Invecchiato Aged' is exactly the same balsamico, but IMHO it sure doesn't taste the same. I wouldn't buy it again - not at this price!"

I ordered 2 packages. But, I received 1 package of Red Tart Cherries and, like another reviewer, the second package was a package of Gooseberries. Plus, each and every can of the Cherries was dented badly. So I could not use anything from this order. I must say that Amazon was wonderful with this issue and gave me a refund with no hassle. This is my first problem with an order from Amazon after many years of service. So for that I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 star."
64736,B000I6625I,A3DD96LN8U1NM,12/2/10,2,4,2,Not impressed,"Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for making a great cherry pie using these cherries. Sour cherries are hard to come by where I live.  However, I was very disappointed.  The cherries are a light, pinkish color and are bland and tasteless. I followed the recipe directions inside the label for cherry pie filling, but it still came out a little watery.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think I'll try making cherry pie again unless I can get my hands on some fresh cherries."

Or did until I got this, thinking I could sneak some veggies into that little stomach of his.  Mixed it up, didn't tell him I had made the swap and handed it to his little smiling face.  He ran away, came back and gave me a full glass back, telling me it was ""icky"".  Later, out of the blue he declared ""mommy, I don't like chocolate milk!"" I'm now trying to figure out how I can sneakily hide this stuff in other foods until I get rid of it.  Maybe chocolate cake?<br /><br />If it tastes as bad as it smells, I can't blame the poor guy.<br /><br />I also do agree that the packaging is terribly wasteful."

I like the product, though.  But I may have to look for something else.  I have purchased greens for myself from a variety of companies over the years.  I have never seen anything like this."

The boy drank a little, but didn't want to finish.  He then tried it with apple juice, but just couldn't enjoy it.  My wife and I tried it and didn't like it either, so I can't blame the kids.  This stuff doesn't dissolve completely either, so it looks like your drink is full of sand (I swirled diligently).  I don't know what I'm going to add this stuff to so that it doesn't go to waste.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the can is half empty, which I think is deceptive marketing."

First off, the packaging of this is very wasteful, 3/4 of the container is empty..making you feel totally ripped off! My 7 year old wont drink without being mixed with some sort of milk, which you really have to blend because the powder doesnt dissolve well. A well balanced, largely plant based diet is really the best route to go in the long run. The quantity and price of this product is a joke."

It also contains too many ingredients.  I prefer making my oatmeal the slow way, controlling the amount of sweetness and without all the additives."
64917,B005MWAM72,AE61FFT0GUD2G,8/29/12,0,0,2,"Not The Same Product of Years Past, Bust Still Good For A Fast, Hot Breakfast","In years past, I have eaten instant oatmeal for a quick, easy, hot breakfast when I am in a hurry. I have eaten various flavors including the brown sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.<br /><br />The maple flavor was bland and chemically, and although it was sweet-ish, I really couldn't detect the flavor of brown sugar. It did, however, have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.<br /><br />In addition, the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for breakfast. It requires, at a minimum, two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.<br /><br />I was not enamored with this product, and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However, as part of a variety pack, I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal, but do not have the time to cook it from scratch."

Use on road trips, but otherwise make your own.","Like most instant oatmeal, this ended up being a lot like baby cereal in texture and way too thin if you don't cut back on the amount of water called for.  One packet barely does anything to put a dent in your hunger.  The taste was just okay and not as good as other instant oatmeals I've tried.<br /><br />You can cook quick oats in the microwave in about the same time, add your own brown sugar and cinnamon and a bit of salt, and it will taste worlds better.  Make it with milk instead of water, and it will be even richer.  I might use these instant oatmeal packets on a road trip, but other than that I'd rather make my own on the stovetop.  For the extra few minutes, it's worth the greatly improved taste and texture."

I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.<br /><br />First of all, it tastes different. More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken. Next time I'll try Strawberries & Cream and see if it's still awesome."

This one has great texture and a good initial taste but then a strange bitter note like that of blackstrap molasses hits your tongue and a an unpleasant sulpfur after taste that lingers. It is too sweet and almost more of an anise flavor then real pure licorice. I don't know whats in it it came in a clear bag twist tied from a health food store locally. If you love blackstrap you may like it. I much prefer RJ's it is all natural and much better in both texture and pure real licorice root flavor. I like Panda brand for flavor too but not texture. I would not buy Kookaburra brand again.

I wanted to have extra for passing around to my friends. I eagerly tasted my coffee with the flavored pills; absent of carbohydrates, great for chocolate and caramel lovers. To my dismay, even with two pills, my coffee was still lack-luster. Neither the chocolate nor the caramel tasted like the real thing, just another ho hum imitation flavor assimilation lacking quality for the taste buds. In my opinion, these pills are not worth buying. This is too bad because such care went into the packaging. If the product had half the class the packaging does,I would purchase their product for my coffee shop."

Not something that I would give to any dog let alone a Yorkie and a Poodle. The bones take up a lot of room in the can. The rest of the can contains little cubes of meat, a few vegetables and lots and lots of gravy. I usually split half a can between the two dogs. The only way I am able to get another meal out of the can is to add more cooked vegetables. The dogs really like it but I will not buy this flavor again. You are getting less for your money since it contains bones and so much gravy. I would recommend the Turducken. They absolutely love that one."

I thought this might help me save some money.  Boy was I wrong.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get anything resembling a strawberry flavor.  I couldn't believe it, so I literally titrated the stuff into a glass of whole milk with one tablespoon of sugar added.  Drop by drop.  2-3 drops wasn't too noticeable.  By 9 to 10 drops, there was a horrible chemical mouthfeel, almost a mouth burn.  It was as though I was drinking Kodak film developer or something.  Maybe there was the slightest hint of strawberries, but nobody would have found it palatable.

This is just an FYI to the folks like me who have to be careful what they eat and drink. The sulfites in this pickling blend are used a preservative, which is completely unnecessary in my opinion.  McCormick simply wishes to ensure an indefinite shelf life for this stuff at the expense of individuals' health.<br /><br />PS - I love to make pickles, jellies and preserves, etc., and to give them as gifts.

Not this one.  They prominently display ""GREEN TEA"" on the box cover, and state ""with WHITE TEA for SMOOTH TASTE"".  But unless you really look, you won't notice that it also has natural lemon, and orange flavors, along with other listed flavorings, and Stevia to boot (for natural sweetness).  All this sounds yummy, right?  I don't think so.  Sure, the first few sips were like ""hmm, that's not bad"" but quickly the flavor of this bastardized ""green tea"" became annoying.  Probably not so much the flavor, but definitely the sweetness is too much for me.  But if you like sweet beverages this one is fairly tame so you'll likely find it OK in that department.<br /><br />My main problem with this is the fact that it's advertised as ""Green Tea"" and I believe this is misleading.  It doesn't remotely resemble authentic green tea in terms of flavor, in fact you can't even taste the green tea here because it's overpowered by the other flavors.  Real green tea is very mild in taste and doesn't need a sweetener because it's smooth and tasty without all the extra ingredients.<br /><br />Even if it wasn't for the misleading here, this mix is still not my cup of tea.  It's ""OK"" at best, but I wouldn't buy it again and I'm not sure I would even mix a bag or two in with my regular brand of green tea (for iced tea).<br /><br />Finally, I am NOT in the habit of writing bad reviews for products on Amazon.

Having said that, I do enjoy Celestial Seasonings Authentic Green Tea as one of the most drinkable low-priced greens, and I also appreciate their eco-friendly packaging.

The idea of a salt & pepper cashew is a good one but I'd take a plain roasted, salted cashew over these any day. To me, the delicious taste of the cashew itself is ruined by the seasoning."

The nuts were fresh, but the seasoning was a bit too heavy-handed - they are very salty and the pepper has more of a bite than I liked.<br /><br />The seasoning gets stronger the lower you get in the can due to it falling off the upper ones and coating the lower ones. While tolerable when first opened, the seasoning becomes way too overpowering once you get half-way down in the can. I found myself putting the nuts in a dish and rolling them around a bit to dislodge some of the seasoning.<br /><br />If you're on a sodium restricted diet (or just want to cut down on sodium) you definitely want to pass on this.<br /><br />If they would dial back the salt by 50% and the pepper by 75%, it would be a great product.

There's actually so much that I can hardly tell I am eating cashews at all.  So, if you feel compelled to eat cashews for health reasons, like you need the fat that you'd get by sitting down in front of your favorite TV show and wolfing down a tin of 'em, and you don't want to taste them too much, I would recommend this product.

That being said, I have to come out and say I just don't like these cashews, which are practically encrusted with salt and pepper.<br /><br />In our family we don't salt and pepper our food liberally, so maybe my wife and I were particularly sensitive to the salt-and-pepper blast of these cashews. Again, it's a matter of taste: if you love salt and pepper, you might like these.<br /><br />To write a fair review, I decided to wash the seasonings off the cashews under tap water to taste the bare nut underneath. I was surprised to find that the salt and pepper didn't just rinse off. Something was making it adhere to the cashews. So I soaked and rinsed and rubbed with my fingers a little more and finally got all the seasoning off the 5 or 6 cashews I had in my hand.<br /><br />Once I got all the seasoning off (or so I thought), I noticed something else that surprised me: the cashews were still greasy. This wasn't intended to be a whole-day affair, so I just popped two in my mouth. The first thing I noticed was that the cashew retained a slightly crisp, roasted character even after the drenching. That was the good news. Then I dropped the remaining cashews in my mouth, and a few seconds later came the bad news: I started tasting that pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop, poking its way through an otherwise tasty though plain roasted cashew.<br /><br />If you'd like a simpler review, my wife, a no-nonsense woman, ate just a couple and said, ""I hate these.

Soon a salty taste mixed in with the oil, followed by the flavor of stale dimestore pepper - the kind grandmas keep in a tin in their cupboard for years because no one uses it. After completing the first tortureous bite, I ate 2 more nuts just to be sure they were not some acquired taste or novelty I may be missing out on. They were not. Took a good brushing and rinsing with Listerine to burn the flavor out of my mouth.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars because I eat a lot of fresh foods and an above average amount of raw foods.

I can definitely taste the onion and citric acid (provides a bit of tartness), and cannot quite put my finger on the mystery spice.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are reasonably sized, most are whole or halves, with some broken pieces.  I've uploaded a photo above so you can see them.<br /><br />But ugh.  The taste is just not for me, and there is too much of it.  I think the rare person who really likes the salt/pepper/onion/mystery-spice flavor might enjoy these, as at least one reviewer has, but I'll pass in the future -- and I *LOVE* cashews in general.

There is also a hint of onion flavor with some citric acid to give them a slightly sour taste. Some cashews were almost completely encrusted with coarse salt making them almost bitter in taste. I found it hard to have more than 2-3 cashews at one time. Combining a handful of these cashews with a cocktail is a sure way to get heartburn!<br /><br />The price is also on the higher side. I prefer the store branded lightly salted and far less oily tinned cashews you can get at any grocery store to these.

You can get the same experience by sprinkling some salt and pepper on your hand and licking the spices.<br /><br />No one could eat very many of these without a beer or other beverage that complements the saltiness and pepper.<br /><br />The package shows lots of perfect cashews, but my package contained more broken pieces and halves than complete cashews.

The good things about this mac and cheese cup are that it tastes pretty good, it is convenient and easy to fix, and there are no dishes. If you want a little taste of fast food (220 calories), but don't want to leave the house, have money to spend and care nothing about nutrition, you've found a terrific product.<br /><br />The negative things:<br />(1) It is super-high in carbohydrates at 40g per 220 calorie serving. Definitely to be avoided if you are diabetic or are pre-diabetic or don't want to be.<br />(2) It is high in sodium at 670mg for just those 220 calories--yikes!<br />(3) The ingredients list is long and reads like a chemical formula. If this is what you eat anyway, you might not care. But if you're used to real food, it does have a kind of synthetic odd off taste to it. I liked it initially, but it lingered with me for a while afterwards and I had to keep drinking water to wash the aftertaste away.<br />(4) It is mostly white rice flour, corn syrup solids (sugar), and fake cheese. Please don't feed this to your children. Whatever you do.<br />(5) As mentioned above, terrible for nutritive value--no nutrition whatsoever besides calcium (6% of your daily requirement) and iron (8% of your daily requirement). No other vitamins or minerals.<br /><br />Only recommended if you're already used to fast food and junk food and if you also don't care one bit about nutrition. I gave it two stars because if you're that type of person anyway, it's not a bad choice as at least you're not getting the gluten. You're not getting anything else either except empty calories, but if you can handle the chemically aftertaste, you might upgrade your diet by avoiding the gluten.<br />**<br />**"

This tea is very close to what I've gotten in Thai restaurants, but the price is outrageous...especially after shipping.  I bought these two teas before venturing to my local Asian food market - stupid, I know.  But when I got to the market, I found the price on thai mixes to be between $2.50-$4.  So it's not even the shipping that makes the price high.  It's good, but not enough to warrant paying the extra cost.<br /><br />And if you're looking to make Thai Iced Tea, don't follow the recipe on the label.

I had it in an airtight ziplock bag, but the smell was so strong, my whole car smelled like it the rest of the day.<br />I guess I'll donate it to the shelter or something..."
65891,B0007A0AQW,A2CV6KXDKFYIN1,12/11/10,9,11,2,Great in Every Way Except they STINK!!,"I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the ""natural"" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the ""natural"" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.  The things I do for my dogs."

But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over.  Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.<br /><br />i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with ""caviar tastes"" that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs)."

The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.  This means that you don't have to cut them up or break them into little pieces (I'm looking at you, Buddy Biscuits), but your dog will still go the distance to earn them.  The small size makes them super convenient.  I have used the peanut butter, chicken, and salmon flavors.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salmon flavor has an awful stench.  I am used to reeking like dog treats, but the salmon odor is too much.  Upon opening the bag for the first time, I gagged.  Even now, several months after purchasing the 1lb bag, I am still trying to get rid of these treats.  I tried passing them off on my mother, but she wouldn't take them because of the smell.  Yesterday I decided I would just bite the bullet and use them for training for a few days, but after just a couple minutes in the bag I use for treats, I gave up.  I just couldn't take it.  I stuck them back in the bag they came in.  I think I will mix the remaining treats with a giant glob of peanut butter to try to get rid of them in one stinky fell swoop.<br /><br />So Zuke's: we love you.  You have a great mission that both my dog and I both appreciate in our own ways.  The salmon mini naturals, however, definitely miss the mark.  We'll stick to the chicken and peanut butter flavors."

She will eat them (the first treat she rolled on as she'll do if I give her lox) but she won't do tricks for them and acts as if they were a run of the mill dog food instead of a treat. Both my mate and I found the smell rather unpleasant similar to old B vitamins or really old liver treats, not like salmon..<br />(FYI My is dog is medium sized black mutt.)<br />UPDATE:My dog seems to be getting used to these to some degree she will now do some tricks perhaps she prefers them a little dried out (they are still soft)or even maybe she was addicted to other treats though I usually only give her wheat and gluten free treats like freeze dried liver and dogswell treats..Perhaps she's stil not crazy about them because these treats do have natural gluten in the form of malted barley and ground barley (Not that good for me in terms of cross contamination as I am gluten sensitive and perhaps she is too?)

Amazon sent me an email about their newest kcups and I was excited to try them. After looking at all choices and description, and reviews, although they were hard to find since most were for the variety pack; I chose the Costa Rica blend. I did not want too bold a coffee and this seemed to fit the bill. After trying two brews with different strengths, this coffee just tastes "" off"" and like an inexpensive coffee. It actually upset my stomach causing acid, with very little consumed. Specifically, though, the taste is weak, like old coffee;  not smooth or full flavor, and the smell which I noticed immediately-had an unpleasant aroma. Not the great coffee smell we all welcome with our morning coffee. Maybe I got a bad batch but the date was ok and these are new, so I think it's the way they are. I cannot recommend."

I have been using Aspen Mulling Spices even longer than that. As soon as there is the tiniest hint of cold in the air I start mixing this in to every drink I have. This year, for the first time, I decided to order the sugar-free version and I was extremely disappointed. First off.. while it isn't obvious anywhere in the Amazon ad, it is only 2oz compared to 5.65oz of the original. So nearly 1/3 the amount but for the same price (or even higher). I get if this was 10+ years ago and Splenda was still new and magical and a fad, but there are few other products out there anymore that charge more simply because they're made with Splenda. And to make it even worse, looking on the packaging where it gives you recommended amounts to use for different drinks, some of the amounts it suggests are now higher. For example: 1.5tbsp for Brandy on the original, but 2tbsp for sugar-free. So you'll also be going through this faster. And finally, to me, the taste just isn't the same. I'm not talking about Splenda vs sugar, I don't use real sugar in anything. But the actual product seems to be different. It is an extremely fine powder, closer to the consistency of powdered sugar, whereas the original is more like regular sugar or salt in consistency. Whatever they have done has completely changed the flavor profile to me. And again I'm talking about the taste of cinnamon, of cloves, etc, not how sweet it is. I have been shopping on Amazon for a long long time and this is the first product I have actually reviewed. If you want this healthy-nuts opinion... just order the original and use it in moderation. Just like anything else."

This was the only product that the retailer I was at had available for purchase that was billed to kill moss safely without killing the lawn as well.  One week later the moss looked no less healthier than it did prior to spraying.  I had some left over in the bottle and reapplied with no further results over the next week.  I do not recommend this product and I will be trying the Scotts brand granules next as the reviews on that product are great and it is actually cheaper than this.

The packaging was very good and I appreciated receiving the pumps for each flavor. The directions state to use 1 1/2 pumps for hot drinks- well this was way too much for my taste. The pumpkin spice flavor was overwhelmingly harsh and spicy. I found if I used enough for it to be sweet, then it was way too spicy. When I used a smaller amount, I had to use sugar to sweeten my coffee. I normally like spicy flavors but this is just too strong. I'm not sure how we'll ever make our way through the flavors.

It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.

I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues."

The Scorpion Sauce DOES taste good but doesn't have the heat you would expect or want. It WILL mess up your stomach though.<br /><br />There was another reviewer that stated hes had hotter sauces that didn't bother his stomach as much as this did and he is absolutely correct. You could easily fill up a large spoonful of this stuff, let it set in your mouth a while, then drink it with no burning or sense of heat.... but your stomach WILL quickly disagree. Actually, just small doses of this stuff really irritated my stomach. I can drink a dipping bowl full of habanero sauce with minimal stomach irritation.. but just a small amount of Trinidad Scorpion bothers my stomach quite a bit. I just wish I felt like I accomplished something when my stomach hurts this bad. It's literally like downing cocktail sauce then feeling like you were bashed in the stomach with a base ball bat repeatedly. I do like the taste but the messed up stomach isn't worth it when there's no heat to justify the irritation."

I reasonably expected this to be the big size based on that information. WRONG!<br /><br />I received my order very quickly, it was well packaged and the coffee IS pretty good. BUT...the jar is only the 100g size which is TINY! I expect a markup on European goods  because they've come a long way to get to the US, but this is ridiculous.

Rinsing them off and boiling them only helps to some extent; you're going to need to drown them in something strong if you don't like your noodles to smell like week-old carp. Once you get past the smell, they are a reasonable replacement for noodles, though they are more chewy than the real thing and they have sort of a tangy aftertaste. They might be okay in an oriental dish, but they were ghastly by themselves (I tired both fettuccini and red meat sauce)."

I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic four months ago and despite taking insulin I couldn't get my blood sugar under control; I made the switch to LCHF and  less than a month later reduced my insulin by half and again by half and today I manage my diabetes without any insulin, pill or injection.  A reviewer used the analogy of eating rubber bands and another, cartilage and both are right.  I remember someone recommending me Dreamfield's pasta...except it tasted pretty darn good but falsely advertised it's product; it was no different than Ronzoni's Smart Taste which I allow myself to eat about once a month as a splurge treat.

My husband will have to eat the rest of the 5 packages (and he will eat anything) and he agrees that they are weird and sort of have the texture of squid.  I even followed the directions to a T but still couldn't get rid of the ""fishy"" smell.

And it's smaller in weight than the local store's product.  I was also surprised that the noodles are clear.  But in the picture, they do look clear.  The local product contains tofu to give it a more noodle-like look (and more calories).<br /><br />So all of that to the side, I do think this flavor of shirataki noodles are less smelly than other varieties I've tried.  And they taste like the others, which pretty much means no taste.  But they do give you somewhat the experience of eating a noodle while really saving on calories.  As with all shirataki noodles, they're a tad bit slimey and can be a little bit hard to eat at first.<br /><br />To use this product, I rinse it very well in a collander, trying not to smell it as it comes out of the package.  Then I heat them in the microwave 2-3 minutes to warm them up.  Rinse that water off.  Top with other things, like steamed Asian mixed vegetables.  I toss them in a little curry as well."

However, I didn't expect it to smell so nasty.  It was pungent and just plain nasty.  I wouldn't quite call it a fishy smell, but more like a mix of plastic gone bad (does that even make sense).  But you know what, it does do it's job of filling you up.<br /><br />If you MUST cook with this, do it in soup noodle form."
67263,B004JRXZKM,A3P3J6QFE7K230,5/4/11,286,307,2,A bowl of cartilage,"I heard about Miracle Noodles on Dr. Oz recently and couldn't resist trying them out, because they were touted as a delicious low carb alternative to pasta. Yes, I'd read the reviews and heard a lot of horror stories about how weird they tasted and smelled, but in spite of the negative reviews, I still got a pack of these because I'm a fan of all things Asian and figured that the poor reviews were from people not used to exotic food.<br /><br />Well, I tried them and can now render my verdict. You know that saying, ""The truth between two extremes lies somewhere in the middle?"" Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to people's reactions to these noodles. They are neither what the haters make them out to be nor at all what the ravers claim that they are.<br /><br />Let's talk about the negative reviews first. Contrary to what so many people are saying, Miracle Noodles do not have a pungent fishy odor or the texture of squid, calamari, or rubber bands. When I first opened the bag I had to really sniff for a ""fishy"" smell, since it was barely discernible. However, I did smell something else, a mild aroma not unlike that of sweetened soy milk. Not to worry, as these smells easily disappeared when rinsing and boiling the noodles.<br /><br />As for the texture? Not at all ""rubbery"", but very... gelatinous. At first I thought it was similar to those chewy fruity bits you often find in Asian puddings and drinks. But after chomping on the noodles for awhile, the texture became unmistakeable-- it was like cartilage. And no, this is not an exaggeration. The noodles had the exact semi-gelatinous, semi-crunchy consistency of cartilage. Did the texture make these noodles inedible or the worst thing ever? Not at all. Just very... jarring.<br /><br />What about the rave reviews claiming that this product is a perfect substitute for fettucine or other types of pasta? No way, Jose. Because their texture has a ""fleshy"" quality to it, Miracle Noodles are more suitable as a vegetarian substitute for meat, fish, and poultry dishes, especially since they absorb flavors so well. (When I poured oyster sauce on mine, they really did taste like a seafood-like dish.) But as a replacement for pasta? Good Lord, no. Not in a million years. I can see someone hankering for these if they want to have something in lieu of meat, but there's no way someone would be craving these in lieu of pasta. There are no similarities whatsoever between the two.<br /><br />So basically, don't believe the hype about this product, because it's definitely been mismarketed to the wrong eaters. Miracle Noodles do have some potential as a staple in the diet of someone either foregoing meat altogether or trying to cut down on it. But as a substitute for pasta or carbs? Not a chance."
67317,B004JRXZKM,A73F6HTGSNVAM,1/13/12,1,1,2,Very odd texture,"Bought these in bulk because it was cheaper.  Have the spaghetti, fettuccine, and the rice.  When you open the bag it has an odd odor, not necessarily what I would call fishy, more of a preservative smell that goes away when the noodles are rinsed.  I made fettuccine carbonara last night with the noodles. Honestly, the taste was fantastic, I mean who doesn't love bacon!  The noodles truly have no taste, and take on the flavor of what they're cooked with.  But attempting to chew the noodle was a different story! The texture is like nothing I've experienced and is kind of hard to describe.  You really have to chew these noodles.  The texture is a cross between spongy, gelatinous, and squishy shrimp or meat.  That said, the texture won out over taste, if I focused on the texture it took everything I had in me not to gag! For me texture is as important as taste, and I just couldn't get past it.  Since I have so many, I will be figuring out how to use them and I have some suggestions to make them more palatable.  First, get out your scissors and cut those noodles into smaller pieces, the less you have to chew, the better.  After you have rinsed the noodles in hot water, dry them on low heat in a frying pan with a touch of olive oil.  The noodles retain moisture and Without being thoroughly dried, they can make your dishes more watery.  If you have an iron stomach, and know you can overcome texture, these can be a healthy pasta substitute.  Do not expect them to have a pasta texture though!"
67323,B004JRXZKM,A3DCGLN9CO4BEW,10/11/11,1,1,2,Miracle Noodles,"So I really wanted to try this product to avoid consuming calories late at night and was disappointed. The noodles are in a liquid that smells terrible. When you wash the noodles as directed the smell does not go away. I tried everything on the noodles to avoid the smell, hot sauce, tomato sauce, a bunch of spices, and gravy.. Nothing worked. I had to force myself to finish eating them because I hate wasting food. The concept is great but they are very unappetizing.."
67331,B004JRXZKM,A2KATUXY21CO03,5/6/11,3,4,2,Not great for first time dieters or non-vegetarians,"To like this product you really have to NOT expect to taste an actual noodle. There's no dough taste, no noodle texture, etc.<br /><br />The ""pasta"" part really only comes from the fact that they're cut into noodle-like shapes but that's where the similarities end. Do not listen to any of the reviews that tell you this tastes just like real pasta- it doesn't. At all.<br /><br />First off you need to not be sensitive to what the noodles initially look and smell like. When you open the bag you will be hit with a horrible smell that I'm told is the water it's packaged in more than anything else. If you drain the noodles and give them a quick rinse off in cold water you'll get rid of the smell pretty quickly. Also, the noodles themselves look and feel like squishy, raw calamari right out of the bag. That and the smell certainly doesn't help get you hungry but again, rinse it off and you'll get rid of the smell.<br /><br />After that you really need only drop the noodles into some boiling water for a minute or two to cook them and you're good to go so really the longest part of preparing the noodles is boiling the water and/or cooking whatever else you plan on adding to it.<br /><br />The best way I can describe the texture is that its like the pink pieces of ginger you get with sushi but obviouly without the same flavor. The noodles themselves are relatively bland so theoretically they should take on the taste of whatever sauce you cook it with but I didn't find this to be true. It's a weird texture, to be sure, but the noodles don't have much of a taste on their own so I can't really say the taste bad.<br /><br />If you're a vegetarian or a vegan who is used to eating ""strange"" things, tofu, etc then you might love this product as it definitely has that kind of feel to it. If you're a pasta lover this is nowhere near as good as real pasta and if you're a low-carb dieter looking for a way to cheat and get a pasta fix I think you'll be disappointed with it. Still, they're relatively healthy and relatively inexpensive so they just might be worth a try if you're looking for a pasta alternative just be warned that it doesn't taste like pasta.<br /><br />I would never order this in a restaurant and I won't be purchasing them again but if I went to a new girlfriend's mother's house for dinner and she served these up I would be able to eat them without a problem :-)"

Since this tea claims to combine vanilla and chai, I decided to try it.<br /><br />It is remarkably bland and frankly, the chai spices are barely perceptible, whereas the vanilla taste is non-existent. It is not a particularly potent tea either. I also agree that there is an odd, slightly fishy taste to this tea. I will finish the box (I started putting cinnamon sticks in it to give it some flavor), but this was a real miscalculation on Twinings' part. I wrote them about it and they didn't even bother to reply. My guess is I am not the only one disappointed by this tea, and since it isn't exactly cheap, my advice would be to look elsewhere if you want chai tea."
67421,B000F4DKBC,A234OFCJVQW6IR,12/17/10,1,1,2,"A Better Name would Be, ""Cinnamon Oil Tea""",I have only recently discovered a love for Chai Tea but it could be only a certain brand. I really enjoy the Celestial Seasonings brand Chai which has more body and well-blended flavor. This had such a strong cinnamon flavor and it was more the oil-type not the cinnamon stick type. None of the other flavors stood out at all to me. I really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when I was a kid. I haven't had much experience with other types of Chai so I can't much of a comparison.
67428,B000F4DKBC,A1VVJS8WFVZFZ5,3/14/11,0,0,2,WAY too much cardamom!,"I used to drink Twinings India Spice Chai in the gold box daily and with great pleasure. It was so much better than Tazo (all ginger and vanilla) and the other supermarket brands (all cinnamon). Before I found it on Amazon I could only get it at the CostPlus/World Market, but happily made the trip. It was often sold out but STILL worth trying for.<br /><br />Then Twinings decided to change their recipe. I think in an attempt to taste more like Tazo, they took out all the subtle masala chai flavors and just dumped in a ridiculous amount of cardamom. It's literally enough to make your tongue a little numb and kills all the background flavors.<br /><br />The positive thing I can say is that it's still super cheap and convenient on Amazon Subscribe. And if you don't care about subtleties in flavor, the overload of cardamom eventually seems to kill those taste buds and it becomes less oppressive over time.  Not good, but less horrible.<br /><br />What was once a wonderful and satisfying tea experience now just gets the job done, but at the expense of all the joy :("

I mean when I buy a chocolate that has chili in it, I expect it to have a kick, but this had no spice or even a little bit of a kick to it.  It just tasted like chocolate.  If you want a good chocolate bar with chili that you can actually taste then I would suggest ""Chuao Chocolate Bar: Spicy Maya""  It is so good and amazing!!!

The donut 'flavor' is chemical-ish and the chocolate is more of a smell than a taste.  It's not completely undrinkable (thus 2 stars, not 1); it just isn't good or enjoyable.  I wanted to try the Donut House Cinnamon Roll too, but am afraid of similar results.<br /><br />I am now looking for a K-Cup buddy to trade with or give away the balance.  I wish Green Mountain Coffee (makers of Donut House) offered small trial packs with 1 or 2 K-Cups of various flavors.  I bought the 24 pack online because I couldn't find it locally; perhaps that should have been a hint!<br /><br />As for recommendations, Green Mountain Coffee's breakfast blend and decaf are great!

The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.

Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me.

I love chocolate and marshmallows and thought this mix looked delicious, so I picked it over the other varieties available.  Unfortunately, the mini marshmallows are nothing like marshmallows -- I was expecting them to be like those found packaged with hot chocolate or in cereals, but they're solid little sugar pellets that are way too hard to chew comfortably.  The graham cracker pieces are also overly crunchy and unpleasant.  The coconut flakes, which I would generally imagine are hard to mess up, seem to be more sugar than coconut...they pretty much melt in your mouth, but not in the good way.  The milk chocolate candies are good (mine did not contain peanut butter as another reviewer mentioned), as are the cocoa roast almonds and honey roasted peanuts.<br /><br />I had been wanting to try the Chocolate Cherry mix, but after this experience, I'm not so sure.  Emerald had a good idea that was, unfortunately, shoddily executed and left me with the opinion that they should stick with what they know...nuts."
68021,B000M5NKUK,A3H9NI5FUXYATL,3/5/12,0,0,2,Leaves an after-taste,I applied this rub onto a pork shoulder and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I smoked it for 10 hours the next day and the meat turned out fabulously. The rub gave a definite spice to the shoulder but I found it heavy on the paprika and somewhat sour with an after-taste. The ingredients were very straightforward and pretty much what you find in almost all of the rub recipes online but I think I'd prefer a little sweetness to complement the meat.  Next time I'll try mixing my own spices but it'd be handier to have everything pre-mixed.

That is to say- something occurred at the factory and instead of six little crackers in the package, you get perhaps four, and the entire side of one cracker is exposed with the cheese uncovered in the pack. Obviously a defective run, but why wouldn't someone notice? When you have a 90 count package and most are defective, I mean...what the heck?<br />The taste is good on these crackers, I can say that for them. But it embarrasses me to purchase something for someone else and have it be defective."

Good texture, good dissolvability. Price is what you would expect--no bargain but not a killer. There is, however, most definitely the flavor of peas there, and nothing really covers it up. I like peas when they are green and I have to chase them around on my plate. In the form of a vanilla, or chocolate, or coffee, or banana, or blackberry, etc., etc. drink?--naw."

The Spry mints are somewhere in between the two."

But like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth.  And they are very salty.  I only cooked them for 90 seconds, the bag was still expanding when I stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done (they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness I didn't do that).  Nice idea but I don't think I will buy these again."
68143,B003EM7J9Q,A1SGCKAJBOJ3PJ,9/12/12,0,0,2,microwave pork skins,I was so excited to receive the product I immediately cooked a bag.  What a disappointment!!  The taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that I didn't enjoy.. I couldn't finish the bag!  My dog wouldn't eat them either ans she eats everything - including brusell sprouts!  I have had microwave pork skins that were good but I don't remember the brand so I'll just have to do without
68182,B003EM7J9Q,AWG67630UAFHL,3/18/12,0,0,2,Tasted good the first few bags...,"But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench/smell when you are microwaving it. Sometimes it would hurt my tongue when I am eating it. All in all, I threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. It might just be me but I can't say I would let the guests of my home try these so I can't recommend them here to anyone."

68250,B003EM7J9Q,A34NVQTFD4QYJ0,3/14/11,0,0,2,"good, not great",I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.
68251,B003EM7J9Q,A3UQAI3GUDJVJY,3/9/11,0,0,2,Wayyyyyyy too salty,"They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag."
68270,B003EM7J9Q,A1TDKFXT5AW2QA,12/19/10,0,0,2,Not very good,"I tried these and wanted to like them, but just couldn't.  They did not seem to ""pop"" very well (a lot of wasted product in the bag) and they didn't taste very good.  I will not be buying these again."
68325,B003EM7J9Q,A1RZBDFGARFT4K,11/21/10,1,2,2,Flavor MUCH too strong.,"Not one member of my family, including me, like these extremely salty, much too strong a BQ taste to order more.  I purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now.  I have received only one shipment. Cancel further shipments.  Not to our taste at all. These are Lowery pork rinds."
68326,B003EM7J9Q,AFCUQ1C7R10YU,8/5/10,1,2,2,Not what I expected.,The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.
68327,B003EM7J9Q,AVEMWTYR60X3W,10/7/12,0,1,2,Lawrey's Microwave Pork rinds review,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.
68329,B003EM7J9Q,A1VAY8VPLQOUWE,6/6/12,0,1,2,Tasted Like Ammonia!,"So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out."
68358,B003EM7J9Q,A30YA7KLPBG6CI,2/14/08,3,10,2,Not For Me,"In all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product.  I purchased it based upon his suggestion.  Unfortunately, the smell (oil I am assuming) of it cooking made me feel ill.  Even though the product cooked perfectly, the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day."
68359,B003EM7J9Q,A2AW4VQLTAI5SO,7/2/11,0,5,2,What about health?,"I considered buying these but the health risks should be considered.<br /><br />These are cured, stored with salt, and have nitrates.<br /><br />If you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns.<br /><br />you can still eat well when avoiding such things."
68383,B003EM7J9Q,A1MF176W8X69JP,12/29/10,1,1,2,BAD BATCH,"This was my second purchase of this product. The first purchase was great, but this 2nd must have been a defective batch. Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but I'm hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon."
68413,B003EM7J9Q,AKWW7AKAD21RO,12/4/08,3,4,2,"OK, but pork rinds shouldn't be gummy.","Not thrilled with this one - threw most of it away.  For some reason, the result ended up being ""gummy"" which isn't something I expected from this type of product."
68420,B003EM7J9Q,AL26J086LIKJ2,4/18/10,2,3,2,Help!,"I am having probs with the cooking. They come out all fluffy and in 20 seconds suck back into themselves and get all hard. I've tried less time, more time and cooking them out of the bag on a paper towel... Dunno what I am doing wrong, and the company doesn't have any contact info. As for the taste..they're Alright..Waay salty and I'm a salt-a-holic!<br /><br />I wouldn't buy again :("
68421,B003EM7J9Q,A12YIKR8WDNS9X,2/27/10,2,3,2,MSG Alert,"I saw these on the Food Network Channel, and they made it sound so delicious on TV. I only wanted to buy one or two packets to try, but Amazon only sells them in a big box.  They're light and crispy if they're popped correctly, a little on the salty side because of the MSG seasoning (beware migraine sufferers). Not all of the bacon chips pop, and you can't eat the ones that don't because it's like plastic before they're nuked in the micro.  Now, I am stuck with the rest of the box."
68422,B003EM7J9Q,A2ZNYHD93IMFCP,10/5/09,2,3,2,Disappointing,I expected better. Flavor is o.k. But half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave.

68518,B0005YWSYM,A1MW5TA0TW43TK,4/28/10,0,4,2,Mediocre,Taste is good if you like vinegar based hot sauce. It's not very spicy; perhaps the pepper sauce novice would like it.
68543,B0044BOZNE,AC2DADD8C4X4H,8/13/12,0,0,2,My won't eat this one - but loves other Sprout flavors,"Let me start by saying that I am so happy this brand is out there...good, healthy, organic meals that are great to take with you when you are traveling or as a backup at a restaurant.<br /><br />My almost 11 month old will not eat this flavor and he eats almost anything!  I am not sure if it is a texture thing as he also doesn't like hummus (lentils and chickpeas are maybe a similar texture), but he loves the Peach Pumpkin Pie flavor as well as tolerates the Black Beans and Corn. These are the only 3 we have tried.  I would recommend not getting a whole case unless you know your baby likes it.  I have to say that of the three this was my least favorite (I try everything my son eats).  My personal favorite is the peach pumpkin pie though.  It tastes like Thanksgiving but it is very healthy!  I might squeeze a few of them into a pie crust and see if anyone notices it is baby food - I guarantee they wouldn't!"
68551,B001L494RY,A122GFTJ7K07D8,8/6/12,0,0,2,Disappointing - very soft and too sweet,I am in constant pursuit of the best nougat and have tried several.  This one I purchased because it was cheaper but you get what you pay for.  It is too sweet and is very soft and airy - reminiscent of eating marshmallows.  The almond flavor was so intense that it tasted artificial.  Very disappointing.  I will not buy this product again.
68611,B000E63LOM,A3BPSGU7LT9PFZ,11/12/07,3,5,2,Too Strong,"I was planning to get the English Breakfast, but instead got the Morning Thunder somehow.  The tea is OK, but it seems to brew too strong (strong flavored) for my liking.  Definitely not a ""bad"" tea, but not one for my taste."

While this isn't necessarily unhealthy, this kind of main ingredient isn't really 'big picture food.'  I do appreciate that the bars are Vegan and GMO Free - but I wish I'd been a little more aware of the Main Ingredient.  I would've returned the product, but these are not eligible for return."
68643,B0019CSQ36,A39WMF96QORN95,1/28/11,0,0,2,High fat jerky,"I got a bag of jerky at the drug store a few weeks ago because it was on sale and I wanted a low-fat, low-carb, high-protein snack.  It was pretty good but a bit expensive so I decided to get some at amazon.com with a subscribe and save deal.<br /><br />Sad to say, I shopped based on price because I thought jerky was jerky.  That was a mistake.<br /><br />This Lawry's jerky is tender and easy to chew but the fat content is almost as high as the protein content.  This is low-budget, low-quality jerky.  My kids like it but I would prefer to pay a little extra and get them healthier stuff.<br /><br />I canceled the subscribe and save.  I will look for something different."
68652,B0019CSQ36,A635EJI324B01,6/17/08,0,0,2,Jerky-esque.....,"I can only call this stuff ""jerky-esque,"" because it is really not like any ""real"" jerky that I've ever had before. Easy to bite through and chew, but extremely processed and pressed into form. As alluded to in another review, the look and texture of the these is very reminiscent of jerky-treats that are made for dogs. Overall, I'd give the texture 2.5-3 stars....different...a bit odd...ok, but not really ""meaty.""<br /><br />Taste, I'd give 2 stars. They rate as edible, but certainly not good. Eating a full serving at one time tends to feel like a chore, so that should tell you right there that these things aren't too great. Not horrible, but not something I'd prefer to eat...<br /><br />Value. Decent, but in a subjective sense. You get a lot of product for the price....which is great if you happen to like them....but nothing to crow about if you don't...."

So I was rather disappointed and will not order again."
68662,B001GTXRUY,A9V5796BY972C,8/25/11,0,0,2,Lacks Flavor,"This tea is not nearly as flavorful as the Harney and Sons Sweet Cinnamon Sunset or their Hot Cinnamon Spice. The shipping was affordable though. If you are looking for a primo cinnamon orange tea, try the Crossroads tea company signature tea. Their shipping a bit overpriced, but you won't be disappointed in the product anyway. No sugar required with their tea! It's awesome."
68699,B000FJLXHU,A2IXM1MOIFP0C1,6/22/11,4,10,2,Too expensive,They sell this rice too expensive on Amazon!! You can get it for a lot of cheaper from Chinese Supermarket.

Mostly powder inside the bag, and has a very strong ""grassy"" smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />On top of that it took 2 weeks for Amazon to deliver it."
68779,B002N4KDV2,A1RDHASSNJE6XE,1/22/11,2,3,2,Not as good as the Soulistic in Gelee,"Having purchased the Soulistic ""Gelee"" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the ""Gravy"" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the ""Gelee"" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the ""Gravy"" flavors."
68791,B001M0G1R8,A1VOTOGS2SN3MU,7/27/09,0,3,2,Product of China - very disappointed,"I bought this product because of the other review saying it was a product of France.  Not so, this is a product of China, as stated on the label.  I have not sampled the product yet, but I am very disappointed.  This is not a fault of Amazon, but the other reviewer.  Maybe in Europe they get a product of France, but this product says packed for American Roland Food Corp. New York.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed as: Boletus Luteus, Pleurotus, Ostreatus, Auricula Judae, Boletus Edulis"
68796,B0005ZYSIA,A2OV4FJZ5MXWPH,9/28/10,14,18,2,Waay overpriced!,I love Libby's pumpkin and use it for many recipes. Glad the shortage seems to be over. I just bought 6 cans of this (15 oz) at local supermarket for $1.79 each. Quite a difference!

68813,B0002NVLKS,A1VDR5M6GJ1A2K,5/2/10,4,4,2,Disappointing!,"I thought this was a fair price for these mushrooms, but was quite disappointed.  I soaked the mushrooms, as advised and then added them to a soup.<br /><br />The next trial was in a risotto.<br />The mushrooms lack flavor in general.  The stems of these mushrooms are quite inedible; they are very tough and have to be trimmed after soaking.  I would not recommend them and wouldn't repurchase."
68827,B000H7ELTM,A30Y6933LWCQTH,5/19/09,22,25,2,Too much sugar!,Too bad they don't have a sugar-free option.  They taste like raisins with all the sugar.  Good perhaps with breakfast food but not so much for a snack.
68832,B000H7ELTM,A1I85Y08VRZ32Q,5/4/10,4,4,2,"Small berries, way to much oil used to prevent caking.","I have been eating dried blueberries for years.  I mostly buy them from the grocer in smaller portion bags.  I thought I was getting a deal buying these.<br /><br />The blue berries in this pack are very small, yes blue berries are small berries but the berries used by Traverse are extremely small compared to other brands.  The size of the berries was not my main issue with the content of the package I bought.  All berries come with a small amount of oil added to prevent caking.  Traverse uses way to much oil to the point where the flavor of the berries is effected by it.<br /><br />These berries did not taste like the blue berries I had purchased before, all I could taste was the oil.  The berries resembled and tatsed like dried and oiled olives except much smaller.  I did not enjoy them and if I did not toss out the packaging I would of returned them.<br /><br />I would recommend going with a different brand, if not then buy the smaller package first as so you can make sure you like them before spending $50+ dollars on the larger package such as this one."
68865,B0054ETSLE,A7GF6V6KYUVAM,8/9/12,0,1,2,Rock Candy for Birthday Party Favors,I bought this product to use as party favors for my sons 8th Geology themed birthday party. I chose these for the price because they are cheaper than buying the rock candy on the sticks. The rocks are bigger than I expected but they were in pretty bad shape. Most of the rocks were fused together and you cannot even see the strings on most of them. I cannot even tell if they all have strings in them. Most of the strings were broken into small pieces. Besides the size of the individual rocks themselves I was not very happy with this product.
68869,B003TJ0Y1O,A1MOGC2U0QUS55,10/11/11,3,3,2,Tough to Chew,"I was looking forward to having these stuffed grape leaves and serving them to guests (thank goodness I tasted them first), but was extremely disappointed. I opened the first can and found every one of the stuffed grape leaves were very tough (center vein was unchewable). Well, I thought, maybe it's just this can - so I opened the second can. Exact same complaint - the grape leaves are old and tough and I couldn't chew it. I had to spit it out. I will say the flavor was good on the whole but when you can't chew it that's a big ""no no""!"
68882,B003D7TJGI,A2TWPL984OQ5DN,8/9/12,0,0,2,Size does matter!!,"It's been some time since I've bought these, and saw them on sale 2-4-1 at a local store. The box seems about the same size as always, but the tiny little downsized cakes just shake around in it. I hope the stock holders are happy this year, because this is the last box I will ever buy. Even at two boxes for the price of one, these pint-sized cakes are no bargain. If they down-size them again, shoppers will have to buy two boxes to put together one little cake. The cakes are delicious, but barely big enough to taste anymore. There are still some generic companies out there making full-sized cakes, and, in light of this ridiculous miniaturizing, I would wholeheartedly recommend them over Hostess."

So after hearing much about these, I decided to try them.  I tried various flavors, but still I just don't like them.  The texture is probably the worst part, I just find it gross and gummy.  As for taste, they're rather bland.  I think there are better tasting healthy options out there.  As for me, I won't be purchasing these again."

I also shared them with my family and friends which got me varying opinions.  There was only one person that complained it was too sweet. Other health conscious, ingredient readers were impressed with the make and taste.  For myself, I thought they were OK. I don't normally snack on fruit bars like this so it took a bit to get accustomed to the sticky and ""oily"" fruit bar.<br /><br />As I was coming to the last couple bars in my Key Lime Pie, I ventured to get the Coconut Pie. Oddly, they almost tasted the same except for a slightly stronger coconut taste. It still had the ""core"" of dates and nuts,etc.  What really jumped at me is on my 2nd to last Key Lime Pie ... I noticed fuzzy edge on the bar.  The box stated it hasn't expired either so I am hoping this is a single bad bar in the box.  However it doesn't help that to search the term on the comments here that someone had a whole box of *bad*.  I'll see how the coconut pie fares but the mental image is now stuck on me. It is an OK alternative but I may seek another late afternoon snack."
69321,B005T697MC,A1Z8YX4WOIFU6Q,2/16/12,0,0,2,Best I have tried of the exploding soups,"I have found that the Healthy Choice soups are not a good soup for the microwave.  Of all I tried this one is the best, it only explodes or jumps around a little bit, and usually no mess results if you wrap the container in paper towels.  Something in the Healthy Choice soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues.  I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel.  Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave.  This rice based soup recipe does not seem to have as severe of a problem as some of the other recipes I have tried."

While I agree with most others here, the taste is very good, but not worth the money.  If you want Starbucks Blonde, buy a bag and get one of the ecobrew cups and make it that way.<br />Update:  I went and kept track of the number of cups I could get from a bag, and you can easily get 25 cups from one bag which costs about half of what these k-cups do.

The kids were so excited to try these and boy...were we disappointed!  The substitute for flour in this mixture is garbanzo bean flour.  Really?  There are so many flour alternatives on the market and they put beans in this recipe.  And the dough really does have a bean aftertaste.  It starts off sweet and then the lasting effect is garbazo beans.  Not what I want in a cookie.  To make them better, we added more vanilla and then rolled the cookie dough in sugar.  It was the only way to cut the bean flavoring. Also I think they only add 25 chips so be sure and add more to your own recipe.  Betty Crocker's gluten free version is so much better!"

Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices."

Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water."

Way too bitter in comparison to Tazo, I used  almost 10 ounces of water and I wasn't able to finish my cup.  It is very bitter!!! Be aware, and only buy it  if you like real real strong black tea.

69759,B001EQ5NJM,A3PE884TA8529G,5/30/09,37,45,2,"4 Star Taste, But Overall Not A Pleasing Product","I grew up in SE Alaska back in the 70's when the transportation infrastructure was not as good as it is today.  Sometimes, things like fresh meats, fruits, vegetables, and dairy were a bit expensive back then.  While fried Spam was not a staple back then for us, it was definitely a regular on the menu.<br /><br />Now in my mid 30s, I work a lot of late nights and was looking for something quick and easy to eat, yet actually has protein and is filling.  Walking down the grocery aisle, it jumped out at me, viola, Spam.<br /><br />While it no longer sports its key that you used to tear away that thin strip of metal, it was just as I remembered.  However, I no longer had the metabolism of a child.  I am already festively plump, so I figured I better lay off the blue Spam.<br /><br />So I decided to give the Turkey Spam a try.  At about half the calories and much less fat, how could I go wrong.<br /><br />What separates Spam from the cheap Wal-Mart knock off for me is that Spam has a nice firm texture which other imitation brands do not seem to have.  While I would give the taste of the Turkey Spam 4 stars, the texture was terrible.  The texture was soft and mushy, much like the imitation Spam products.  Personally, it reminded me of eating a can of cat food.  After eating a few slices, I could not bring myself to finish the can.  I did not try frying it.  Perhaps some further cooking would firm it up a bit.<br /><br />If you are a Spam addict and figure you need to shave some calories out of your diet, it is definitely worth a try.  The taste was not bad at all.  However, if the texture of your mystery meat products is important to you, I'd probably stick to Spam blue."
69760,B001EQ5NJM,A2L01339XV496V,2/7/10,8,8,2,Do not know WHAT I expected,"Since my family loves Spam (fried for sandwiches) I thought I would try this product for a change of pace. Not sure, really, what I expected but was not sold on this at all. Did not have the taste of regular Spam but did not have the taste of roasted turkey either. Not sure what it tasted like. I proceeded to prepare it as I always do for sandwiches....heated up a non-stick skillet and sliced the product. Now I realize that this product is leaner than the regular Spam, and having said that I know now that I should have sprayed the skillet with a non-stick spray such as Pam. The product stuck to the pan like crazy and I was not able to fry it up evenly. This gave the procuct a mushy texture that was not pleasing. If you try it make sure you spray your pan first to avoid the sticking. Again, while eating it I was trying to figure out what it tasted like......still not sure. Had origianlly gotten this on subscribe and save but I thinkl I will cancel and just remain with the old standby..the original."

It does not have the creamy mouth-feel of regular half-n-half.  I know that this is from treating it for long term shelf life, but I would not invest the money in it when you can get evaporated milk on sale quite often and it has a much longer shelf life.<br /><br />I ordered 2 boxes of this and one box was leaking so bad that FedEx would not deliver it.  The other appeared fine but inside had leaked everywhere and it took forever for me to find one container that wasn't leaking to try the product. The box was packed pretty good, the flat of cartons were wrapped in bubble wrap but with a bit of empty space in the box; so it is a 50/50 chance the cartons are just leaky or damage happened during shipping from shifting around in empty space during transit.<br /><br />Either way, Amazon customer service was wonderful about fixing the problem, but I will not be reordering."

It had a weird bitter taste that I did not like.  As far as baking with it, my baked goods came out looking great, but not tasting as sweet as I wanted them to.  Also, the product does not measure cup for cup to sugar so you need to use more.  For one cup of sugar, you need to use 1.75 cups of Just Like Sugar.

Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike.  I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons.<br /><br />I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet.  I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate.  Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor.<br /><br />I also had a problem with packaging.  When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out.  I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out.  That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant.  I struggled with the second packet as well.  It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly.<br /><br />The description says ""Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors."" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated.  It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey.  As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor...  Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things?  It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this product the way it currently is."

I love nearly all drinks that contain blackberry or pomegranate so I thought this would be a home run.  What a disappointment!  I cannot even describe the taste aside from to say it is very artificial.  The clean crisp natural taste that was expected never occurred throughout the two packages that I drank.  The smell was even artificial.  In fact when I first smelled it, I nearly dumped it down the drain.  It also took some time and a lot of shaking for all of the particles to dissolve into the water.  I did not enjoy this product and will probably not buy or even finish the remaining in the package that I have."
70115,B007I7Z3Z0,A23RZIU0N8K2KR,3/31/12,6,7,2,All I taste is Splenda,"This product has sugar, honey, sucralose, and maltodextrin.

It taste just like Splenda. I was very disappointment because it did not taste like tea, but red juice made with splenda."

By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for."
70125,B007I7Z3Z0,A3JHC8O59WDHFZ,3/29/12,1,2,2,real sugar AND fake sugar - the worst of both worlds,"Blackberry and pomegranate, green tea, and honey sounds like a lovely combination. Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise."

I admit that I tried this after having a packet in my car for while but then it is made to travel, right?<br /><br />The taste is OK but nothing exciting. If I thought about it, I could taste the tea and honey but mostly I tasted the sweet Kool-Aid type taste.<br /><br />I was excited to find this as I cannot tolerate artificial sweetner. The sweetner (besides honey) is made from sugar but is low cal. I'm not sure how that is going to work for me.<br /><br />Overall, not bad but not exciting."

It would even be better if mixed with soda water to give it some kind of soft drink appeal.  I tried serving it to the rest of my family including kids and not a single glass was more than half consumed.  Save your money and try another kind/flavor.  I keep 'sticks' of lemonade flavored Crystal Light in my purse.  This is so disappointing in comparison.<br /><br />You wouldn't expect green tea to taste strong like black tea, but the tea in this drink is virtually flavorless.<br /><br />Bottom line:  wouldn't buy it again."
70224,B007I7Z3Z0,AO9UNKQG83BUP,5/8/12,2,2,2,They forgot to mention the Sucralose,"They keep saying ""naturally sweetened with honey"", but it is like sweetener overkill with sucralose.  Way too sweet, overwhelms any berry flavor that is there, and no green tea flavor is discernable.  Diluting it makes the oversweetened taste become obvious as the berry flavor recedes in the distance, with still too much sweetener.  (Though if you like things extra sweet, you may enjoy this).<br /><br />Too bad.  Try the True Lemon family of unsweetened dehydrated citrus juice packets instead."
70225,B007I7Z3Z0,AO9UNKQG83BUP,5/8/12,2,2,2,"Too Sweet, wish they left out the Sucralose","The box proclaims ""Sweetened with Honey"", and honey granules are listed as the first ingredient, so I thought, finally, something that is just lightly sweetened.  Uh, no, once I tasted it I double checked the fine print ingredients and saw that there is Sucralose in it.  While honey granules might be the largest ingredient by volume, by taste, it is overwhelmed by the artificial sweetener.  When a maker is so deceptive in the presentation of the product, it makes me wonder what else is misleading in it.<br /><br />I tried diluting it, in order to reduce the sweetness.  Well, the berry flavor receded into the background, but it was still too sweet.  Too bad.....<br /><br />It tastes like punch, and the convenience factor is great.  I love the way there are so many of these little single serve water flavors available now, but the artificially sweetened ones are way too sweet, as is this one.  For now I stick to True Lemon unsweetened, and the other unsweetened flavor products from that company.<br /><br />If you like drinks to taste sweet, with a sweetness that lingers in your mouth for many minutes after taking just a sip, you'll probably like this product."

These sticks are meant for 16 ounce water bottles, but I empty a stick into a one (1) liter empty bottle which I fill with water from my Mavea water pitcher.  It still tastes heavy on the pineapple; in fact, I don't notice any mango or tea flavors at all. There is a ""too sweet"" aftertaste, also."

Water can get boring, so I thought this might be good.  I saw what was printed on the box, ""blackberry pomegranate flavor with other natural flavor, no aspartame"".  Hey, that sounds good, but further box reading shows it contains sucralose, here is one comment I found about sucralose:  According to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that ""although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural.""  That kind of ruins this drink mix for me.  If a company (Lipton) wants to put Natural all over its packaging, then be natural all the way, not just a few ingredients."

Lipton's new ""To Go"" Stix are a great idea for travel and the flavor of the tea and fruits together are great. However, the sweetener used in this product is not so great.  I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, especially sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose IS an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body and therefore it is non-caloric. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar),twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame and BOY does it show.  I tried mixing this in different quantities of water and just did not enjoy it one bit.<br /><br />If the product was REALLY sweetened with honey, I would certainly enjoy it more. These packets are ACTAULLY 10 calories as opposed to the stated 5 as each stick is labelled for 8 oz instead of 16 oz.  There is also a problem in the dissolving properties of the sucralose.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk..."

It's one of those products that people buy because of clever marketing -- green tea, decaf, low calorie, honey and Acai-- what could be better?  Actually none of it is good.  Lots of artificial sweeteners, no real honey to speak of, and an overly sweet taste.  Not healthy.  Not that great."

I thought that it was really sweet, luckily I had a bigger water bottle than the directions said because I don't think I would have been able to drink it based on the directions. I could definitly taste and smell the fake sugar that is in it (Sucralose) so I was a little confused when it said that it was sweetend with honey. I would not buy this product again."
70308,B007I7Z3Z0,AF03NDXR2PIFX,3/20/12,4,5,2,It's not as natural as Lipton advertises,"I think that this Liptons To Go Green Tea Mix tastes OK, but I prefer real tea. My wife likes this Lipton's Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix. She likes the mild strawberry flavor.<br /><br />But it is not as natural as Lipton advertises. Lipton's product info states, ""Lipton Tea & Honey ... is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it's made with real ingredients ... blended with honey and strawberry and acai flavors ... Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors ... flavor with other natural flavor ... and no aspartame.""<br /><br />So what's there to not like about that? Well it's not all real ingredients and sweetened with just honey. The fine print discloses that it includes Sucralose (sweetener). Shane Ellison calls himself ""The People's Chemist"" and is the author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402225059"">Over the Counter Natural Cures: Take Charge of Your Health in 30 Days with 10 Lifesaving Supplements for under $10</a>. Shane was a big pharma chemist who quit when he discovered that the drugs that he was creating for the big pharma companies were nothing more than toxins and the real cures were natural and didn't require a prescription. Shane says that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose (Splenda) have serious problems. Studies show that they lead to weight gain and even pre-diabetes. Artificial sweeteners ""disrupt the body's natural calorie counter"" and ""put the users at much higher risk for being obese and insulin resistant."" Shane says that Sucralose, 1,6-Dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-'-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-'-D-galactopyranoside, contains a historically deadly, nasty form of chlorine (RNFOC), which yields poisons such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides. ""An RNFOC can invade every nook and cranny of the body ... and may result in weakened immune function, irregular heartbeat, agitation, shortness of breath, skin rashes, headaches, liver and kidney damage, birth defects, and cancer. Hiding its origin, sucralose pushers assert that it is 'made from sugar'. Sucralose is as close to sugar as glass cleaner is to purified water. France recently banned such false advertising statements. The deceit has been ignored within the United States.""<br /><br />Why does the FDA allow this? Shane says science was sold out for profit. ""Just like chemists manipulate the properties of matter, Big Pharma manipulates studies using 'checkbook science.' This allows them to pay for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. Checkbook science isn't illegal by FDA standards. It's been going on for over 20 years. Known as the Bayh-Dole Act, US law was amended in 1980 to permit flagrant conflicts of interest, ones that allow the industry to design drug trials and hire experts to conjure up favorable results at will.""<br /><br />So if you want something natural, look for Shane Ellison's book and skip this Lipton's tea mix."

As well, there was more sweet cloying taste to me then tea.  I really cannot add much that other reviewers have not already stated.  This stuff is nasty and I do not recommend it to anyone."
70310,B007I7Z3Z0,A2VHCA21QKNEKE,9/19/12,1,1,2,Yuck,So we gave this the old college try but it failed with my entire family. It has too many flavors going on and a bit of a after taste.  We use these type of mixes all the time but this one will stay until the next natural disaster. Not worth the money or ruining a bottle of water.
70315,B007I7Z3Z0,A2QNJNCMAL0GZX,7/28/12,1,1,2,Thumbs Down on Taste; Thumbs Up For Convenience,"This pertains ONLY to the Lipton To Go Stix (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P5NVBI"">Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple, 10-Count (Pack of 4)</a>) product with the honey, mango and pineapple flavor. I had thought this would be a product I'd enjoy as mango and pineapple are two of my favorites when it comse to fresh fruit or smoothies; I've also been a Lipton tea customer for years, and have never been disappointed in their products. I even enjoy honey on occasion as a more natural sweetener, and was curious to see how these flavors would combine.<br /><br />This one was such a disappointment that I gave away what was left in my sampler box (my friends and family didn't care for it either). Now I liked the convenience of the stix, and have appreciated what companies have done in order to give you a somewhat cheaper form of ""flavored water"" so I thought Lipton might have had something.<br /><br />The honey was so prominent and overly sweet that it pretty much wrecked the remaining flavors; it also had a slight chemical tinge which left me with a horrible after-taste in the end. What there was of the mango and pineapple was not the fresh taste I had hoped for, but something with a disgusting artificiality that did not play up a combination which does work very well under most circumstances (such as when I've made up my own mixture); again there was way more artificial sweetness (and this is coming from a Southern girl who loves sweet iced tea on occasion). Even the fragrance was sickening and overpowering. The color in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water was a straw-yellow -- not quite golden, not quite regular yellow, but I figured that meant it would be strong enough to give me the full flavor I desired without being too weak. As I mentioned, I could only take several sips; I think I drank 1/3 of a bottle in the end...and then I called it quits. I even refrigerated it for a bit, as if hoping everything needed time to ""merge""; after a few hours I tried again -- lost cause and down the drain it went.<br /><br />I don't know if the other flavors are an improvement, but I will never waste money to find out. Had the box I received NOT have been a sampler courtesy of Lipton, I would have demanded a refund. Back to the drawing board Lipton!"
70342,B007I7Z3Z0,ATJN4KEHJBOC8,6/10/12,3,4,2,This one is NOT all that good,"We were happy to see a flavor of instant tea from Lipton that didn't have aspartame in it.<br />Mind you, this tea has THREE sweeteners in it - really? Did it really need so much?<br />I vote a resounding NO. Lipton at least didn't load this one up with aspartame, which is a shocker,<br />but they did use plenty of other sweeteners, then added SUCRALOSE too. Too much. Way too much.<br /><br />The honey adds a really pleasant smooth taste to the tea. Most of us at our house like pomegranate and<br />love blackberries, so thought how bad could it really be?  Answer - BAD.<br /><br />This tea is more like kool-aid than flavored tea.<br />The color is a medium pinkish red, not anything like tea and more like kool-aid.<br />The taste is overly fruity, with hardly any tea taste at all. We tried adding some<br />other instant plain tea to it, and it helped somewhat so the box was not a total loss.<br /><br />Would we buy it again?  Nope, not this one.<br />What could have been a healthy, refreshing tea drink ended up being more of a glass of kool-aid<br />instead. We'll pass."
70344,B007I7Z3Z0,ASF0R1CMSF26F,4/22/12,3,4,2,Good taste but fatally flawed,"These Lipton iced-tea packets are a great concept. Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, ""Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL."" This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate."

Some, such as ""Mio"" Sweet Tea and ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch"" are pretty good for what they are. However, most are just either bland or too artificial-tasting for my palate. Unfortunately, ""Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate"", falls into the latter category, somehow managing to taste bland and artificial-tasting, all in one felled swoop.<br /><br />In all, there are far better drink alternatives out there.

Malic acid, maltodextrin, and sucralose are pretty much the only things my tongue registered. I think you'd have to be a professional food taster with an incredibly refined set of taste buds to recognize any hint of green tea or honey.<br /><br />What i really can't grasp is why they bothered putting any real sugar in this in the first place. Why not make it 0 calorie and skip the sugar entirely, instead of putting the 10 calories (per packet, which is two servings, hence 'only 5 calories per serving!') in with no effect whatsoever on the taste of the product.<br /><br />And worse yet, if they're going to grossly oversweeten it, why not use a zero-calorie sweetener like stevia that doesn't taste like a chemical factory exploded on your tongue?<br /><br />People who consume enough fake sugar that they've lost the negative reaction to the chemical aftertaste of those products will probably find this product pleasantly sweet and fruity. Everyone else, well, just don't buy this."

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada!

I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!"

If I bought these at Kroger I'd take 'em back.  The price is right but I have bought store-brand tomatoes that are better than these.
71022,B0049R46OG,A2DHHU1RUAK0A1,3/18/12,3,9,2,unsure of this product,mom said is tasty but is expensive and shipping is costly. will not buy again just because of cost of this item. way too many sellers charge way too much to ship. you dont get much for the price. Is more like a sample size. Also beware beets are genetically modified organisms... not sure of their product origin. I asked but they did not provide an answer if this was a monsanto genetically modified beet product. monsanto gmo products have roundup weedkiller genetically added to their seeds. the plant is a pesticide and weedkiller. so anything that grows on it(food) also has that pesticide weedkiller in it. you therefore ingest this and it alters your dna. monsanto gmos have been linked to organ failure and birth defects. so beware.

I'm a big fan of anything pomegranate flavored and my dad (who rides 50-70 miles a week) said these made a big difference for him. The flavor is great but I haven't noticed any sort of energy pick up after eating them. I've since switched to Sambozan Acai energy drinks and those are a huge improvement.

I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears (or Gummi Bear wannabes), and these did not taste anything like those.  The flavors were not very distinct or fruity.  The texture was also very different and not very palatable.  I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin, and I assume that is why the texture is so different.  However, I have eaten another brand (Sunny Bears) of gelatin-free ""Gummi Bears"", and their texture was very different, more like jelly candy.  I would buy the regular Gummi Bears, but I am allergic to dyes and I can't find any that are dye-free except these and the Sunny Bears.<br /><br />After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them, they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item.

But when you read the packaging the only nutrition comes additives. There is no fiber to speak of and they are loaded with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I use them when my blood sugar drops too low much as I would a piece of candy. These travel pretty well and do give you a bit of volume so you don't feel hungry but they are far from being a healthy food choice."

If you are going to have candy or cake, this is better choice but just as artificial just slightly more fiber which is minimal for a healthy choice anyway. better to eat real fruit, but like i said, good for snack but not healthy. I eat the strawberry ones and I noticed blood on my toilet paper from wiping my behind almost every time I had some. That is not a good sign. Entenmans has similar fruit bars that are a couple calories less and you don't taste all that salt like you do with these. I am switching back."

The case is made of flimsy plastic and was off center.  My husband was able to snap it pretty much back in to place.  But the door was loose, and the panarello was loose and flimsy.  I made some espresso and cappuccino with it, and it turned out OK. But I'm returning it because I just can't live with the build quality. I'm really surprised that no one mentioned the build quality in the reviews I read.  It was much lower quality than the previous Saeco Incanto Rondo that it was replacing, which gave me years of good service.  I'm going to try another brand. I ordered a DeLonghi ESAM 3300 Magnifica instead.  I'll see how that one does."
71173,B002PI82P0,A3LM0MMBTSYWBJ,1/6/11,5,7,2,Completely inconsistent,"As a child and even as a younger adult I remember being bewildered at how much time, effort and frustration my parents wasted on various coffee and cappuccino machines.  They always seemed to spending inordinate amounts of money on what seemed to me to be a bad and unrewarding habit.  What more, it seemed that the more money they spent on a device, the more often it broke.  This seemed even crazier to me as the $20 coffee mate worked fine - for 10 years.  and there was no discernible difference in taste.<br /><br />Then I had kids.  Everything changed.  I don't want to drink cokes anymore and i can't drink swill coffee.  I like the good stuff.  I now understand why people will pay upwards of a thousand dollars for a good coffee machine.  It's crazy, but I understand.<br /><br />So - we bought this $500 coffee maker & nothing has changed w/ the passing of the torch i guess.  It has been nothing but a headache.<br /><br />When this machine works, I love it.  The coffee is good - the lattes are very good.  I like the footprint.  Use is simple.  The problem is it is completely inconsistent.<br /><br />I turn it on.<br />The hopper is full.<br />The water is full.<br />The grind filter is empty.<br />the drip tray is clean.<br />the brew group is clean.<br />the device is primed.<br />I press the coffee button.<br /><br />Scenario A:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip - red light.<br />I push it again, perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Scenario B:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip -  red light<br />I push it again, no coffee<br /><br />Scenario C:<br />Grind grind grind - No drip, Red light<br /><br />Scenario D:<br />Consistent cups of coffee, first time.<br /><br />Scenario D never happens.  The rest happen about equally.<br /><br />I simply can not figure out what i am doing wrong.  I do the same thing three times and it behaves three different ways depending on its mood i guess. I feel like a lab rat trying to pull a lever for my food pellet."

When it arrived we thought it looked awfully flimsy for a $600 machine. We were right. After the first year, knobs and buttons started falling off, and month by month after that the tolerences opened up, and the whole thing fell apart. You could hear it creeking and groaning ever more loudly as it did so. Finally, after three years, it's dead.  You get what you pay for: in this case you'll pay $500+ for great expresso/coffee for three years."

It was as easy to use as most instant conditioners. My hair felt over conditioned and their was some build up after just using it once. It was impossible to style after using this. My hair was flat, flat, flat and sort of oily looking. In all fairness, this might be a great product for dry and damaged hair that is frizzy or heavy but that isn't my issue."

My medium-thick long hair could take it or leave it, but counter to my expectations, her baby-fine hair became extra gleamy and managable.  She says it gives her ""happy hair.""<br /><br />The problem, once I started looking at the ingredients, is that it's chock full of synthetics and silicones, which, oddly enough, can be skin irritants and possibly cause dermatitis in some people.  I'm not so sure that this is what you call ""nourishing the scalp""; it's more of a situation in which you apply silicone to the hair shaft to make it shiny.  So, I'm referring to the cyclopentasiloxane, stearamdo propyl dimethylamine, dimethiconol, etc.  It's a long way down the list before you get to the nourishing shea butter and coconut oil.<br /><br />I guess if I want to nourish my scalp, I could always use pure coconut oil, then shampoo it out.  For what it's worth, I try to keep ingredients natural with my kids."
71305,B007RTR9E2,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,9/28/12,1,1,2,Not for me,"I have tried a few different Clear shampoos and conditioners and so far, I have not liked any of them particularly well. This one is no different.<br /><br />While the scent is nice - it smells like shea butter of course - it just doesn't perform well for me. I need to use a whole lot of it to get any kind of good detangling and softening/conditioning. After I shampoo, I add conditioner, comb it through with a wide tooth comb and then put my hair up in a clip with the conditioner still in my hair, while I wash my body. So, conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so. With this conditioner, I felt like I had to use so many heaping piles of it to get just a tad bit of detangling action. Once I rinse it out, it almost feels like I never even used conditioner. Most of the time I use my other conditioner (Infusium23 or Redken Extreme) after rinsing this Clear one out. If not, I use a leave in because my hair just doesn't feel moisturized or soft enough after using the Clear. My hair is not particularly rough or damaged, so I shouldn't really need to use so much. I definitely don't need to use as much when using my regular brands.<br /><br />It does smell good and rinse well, but there are no benefits to using it. It also does not seem to coat or weigh my hair down, but again no other benefits. I need a conditioner to help me detangle and soften my hair - things a conditioner typically does - this one just doesn't do any of that for me."

It does a good job of moisturizing my hair without leaving a oily or waxy feeling. So it is a good conditioner but I have one problem with it. It has a very different smell to it that I don't care for. It smells like clay or play-doh to me and I just don't like it.

The product itself its a thick pearly liquid, which smells wonderfully nutty. When I washed my hair it felt like it was extremely soft and I though that the end result would be great. I have curly hair which needs hydration so I thought this would work, but it made my curls just drag. I used the shampoo of the same kind with it for a month, then gave up, going back to my regular shampoo."

The tea ""leaves"" are crushed fragments, very nearly as small and dusty as the tea in many grocery-store bagged varieties. I purchased this loose leaf tea to use with standard tea strainers, and unless I use my finest kitchen strainer (that I normally use for powdered sugar dustings on baked goods), I have a cup full of leaf fragments. I don't mind a healthy smattering of tea leaves in the bottom of my cup, but my results with this particular tea were rather more like a stew of leaves. I have no interest in using disposable steeping bags, and I'd rather not have to purchase more apparatus simply to enjoy my tea.

71675,B007RTR8AM,A26LD9FQHTM8ZH,7/22/12,0,0,2,Tingling/burning sensation after use,"Something in this shampoo irritates my scalp and skin and I can't use it long enough to find out if the claims of stronger hair are true.  I used it twice and both times after use my head started having a tingling/burning sensation, even after rinsing, and I didn't like it.  There are a long list of ingredients and chemical-looking names that I'm not familiar with.  I was disappointed because I like the easy-to-use bottle style."
71680,B007RTR8AM,A784A2QRHRSSR,7/15/12,0,0,2,"Strong scent, hair did not feel clean, bad packaging","The scent of this shampoo is an overwhelmingly strong perfume! The shampoo seemed to be cleaning well, but my hair looked greasy afterwards. I was not extremely impressed.<br /><br />And a comment about the packaging (although Amazon might package better for non-Vine orders): Mine came wrapped in a bag inside a bubble mailer. Approximately half of the shampoo leaked out."
71687,B007RTR8AM,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,7/3/12,0,0,2,Not anything special,"OK, review a shampoo, huh? Especially from a guy whose thinning and wispy hair is usually blown about? I was once blonde with wild curls; curls that made my mother in law envious. She'd laugh now--all that blond is reduced to gray, the curls are slight waves, and the count has been decreased by 90%. Well, this stuff didn't help.<br /><br />I've given it three weeks. I wash my hair daily as I commute by bike in 100 degree temps, and I need to. I have been using an Avon product for many years, and both I and my wife have been happy with what it did. My hair is neither as soft, as fluffy, or as attractive with this. I'll stick to the Avon."

THICK FLAKES!! the flakes were HARD and STUCK near the roots of my hair shafts. they were all-over my head. i don't know if this is a normal part of the cleansing or detoxifying of the scalp.. but i have never had issues with flakes.<br />i took a shower right away after trying unsuccessfully to pull the hard pieces out (like a monkey picking lice)<br />happily most all of the pieces dissolved out. i went to the store later feeling self-conscious  that the flakes was showing or more would come back..<br />i am going to continue using this for 7- 10 washes because i feel this is a ""normal"" part of the process. but if these flakes continue.. i will stop..<br /><br />UPDATE** i finished the bottle and got another one.. i haven't seen any more FREAK FLAKES.. the product is still so/so.. i dont love it, but dont hate it. it is fairly affordable, but you get a small bottle, so i think i will be buying panteen next.. good luck on this MIRICLE product.. lol"
71695,B007RTR8AM,A1XTBANUTZ4EEL,6/20/12,0,0,2,Nothing exciting,The main problem with the product is that it leaked a lot in transit.  Luckily it's packaged very well so the package didn't arrive dripping but it was a mess to clean.  Also I received the shampoo courtesy of Amazon Vine but if I had actually paid for the product and lost a big portion in transit I'd be very unhappy.  Overall I feel like the shampoo leaves my fine hair almost too soft so it's not holding it's style terribly well.  It smells great and feels wonderful to put my hands in but isn't quite giving it any volume or lift.  I would not spend the money on this version of the shampoo in the future.
71706,B007RTR8AM,A8WAYVOKYBLO6,6/12/12,0,0,2,Contains scalp irritants,"This shampoo is a cream shampoo that claims to nourish the scalp, but the second ingredient, sodium laurel sulfate, is a known scalp irritant. The shampoo is also tinted pink, as is the matching conditioner. I don't like using hair products with dyes because they stain my hair. It is also heavily scented. I won't use it again, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else."
71760,B007RTR8AC,A3NL394M1LEAFX,5/28/12,7,9,2,Not the greatest,"I have seen the commercials for this product on tv, and so, I was excited when I saw I could try it for free on Amazon Vine. I was not at all happy with this product.<br /><br />First, when I received this product, it had a plastic bag over the top. But it was completely open on the bottom and not sealed on at all. As a result, about a 1/3 of the shampoo leaked into the envelope.<br /><br />Second, I tried this product for about 5 days. I really liked the scent of this shampoo and was anxious to try it. But this shampoo is extremely thick and goopy. It is very hard to rinse completely out of your hair. Even though I was only using a quarter-sized amount at a time, this product left my hair very dull, heavy, and greasy looking. my hair is very thick and I have a lot of it, and it does tend to be oily, so I don't typically use conditioner. After several days, this prodct made my hair look like I hadn't washed for a while. Needless to say, I have stopped using this product and gone back to my old shampoo. I was not all happy with this product and wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />However, I let my mom try it and she just loves it. She has a lot of hair, but it is baby fine. Her hair tends to be flat and doesn't have much body. She said that it makes her hair feel a lot more full and soft. So results seem to depend on your hair type. If you fine hair, I would recommend giving this product a try. However, if you thick hair, I would recommend skipping it."
71791,B007RTR8AC,A1WIXRM2JW9JPH,9/19/12,0,0,2,Too heavy,"I purchased this shampoo at a local big box retailer. I had high hopes for this product as a ""normal"" shampoo (aka NOT Head and Shoulders) that would also mitigate symptoms of dry scalp (though this is not the dandruff formula, it does contain zinc pyrithione, which is the active ingredient in dandruff shampoos).<br /><br />Overall, I have been disappointed in this product. Most egregiously, it makes my hair stringy and very flat--the opposite of the volumizing effects it claimed to offer. In addition, it only did a passable--not great--job at keeping my scalp moisturized. I suppose perhaps the specific anti-dandruff formula does better with that, but since this shampoo claims to promote hair AND scalp health, I expected better. Finally, as ofther reviewers have mentioned, the product can get gloppy; the bottle gets blocked up pretty frequently, even though I'm careful not to leave it open or spill any shampoo around the opening.<br /><br />I gave two stars because the shampoo does have a pleasant smell and a nice lather. Maybe it works better on other hair types, but this is not the stuff for me."
71793,B007RTR8AC,A38K04MT5LR0JC,9/7/12,0,0,2,Left my hair dirty,"I tried this shampoo and was very disappointed.  The product left my hair looking greasy or oily even though it was clean.  This wasn't later in the day, but as soon as I finished using it.  It also did not increase the volume of my hair.  I had also hoped that it might be good for my scalp, but I did not find it especially good in that regard either."
71794,B007RTR8AC,A36TDLV6OK3RO3,8/25/12,0,0,2,"Not ""Clear"" Enough","The selling point of this shampoo is that it doesn't contain parabens so, theoretically, the target market for these is the health-conscious.  As such, I think this falls rather short of the mark.<br /><br />The consistency of the shampoo is all right; it's a bit thin so it's easy to spill at first.  Once you get used to it, though, it's fine.  It lathers well, and it does the job.<br /><br />However, it has a horrendously strong perfumey chemical fragrance.  We find this fragrance truly awful (and overpowering), and it completely undermines any concept of ""clear"" or ""pure"" or ""less unhealthy"" in our minds.<br /><br />We'll take a pass on this one and stick with something less obviously scented."
71814,B007RTR8AC,A167KPMW1NBZJW,6/13/12,1,2,2,Might be good for others but NOT ME!,"The first problem I had with this shampoo, was expecting to see something CLEAR poured into my hand, given the name of it. When it came out a pinkish opaque I should have known that was only the beginning. But I proceeded to use it anyway and was sorely disappointed to the point of all out frustration, perhaps anger. I have very long hair, almost to my waist, and it's always been fine/limp, so seeing that this shampoo says VOLUMIZING, I expected it to do that. Instead it went on like conditioner without having used shampoo, and ultimately it felt like I gave my hair an oil bath. I actually had so much oily residue (or whatever that was!) as a result of using this, that I had to wash my hair again with GOOD shampoo (Pantene), to get that stuff off my hair. But in the meantime, while assessing the consequences of using ""CLEAR"", I found my hair to have zero body or fullness, and it was nearly impossible to get dry, or maybe it did get dry and felt so oily I couldn't tell. Either way, I absolutely hated it. I have been wondering what they were thinking, making a product like this. And as for it being opaque instead of clear, I find that odd, because every other volumizing shampoo I use (Pantene, Dove, Suave, etc) comes out clear and yet does not use that as their claim to fame.<br />Regardless of that, I very generously gave this 2 stars because I am assuming my hair type must be at least partly to blame for my bad experience. I would hope this shampoo is useful for someone that has excessively dry or ""wiry"" hair who needs the deepest conditioning to tame it or soften it."

71937,B001LQTEF4,A1CF9PSOIMVKAK,8/24/11,8,10,2,Made in China,"I bought this ginger for my wife thinking it was probably made in Australia or in U.S.A. because the only factories listed in Ginger People's web site were in either Australia or California.  Therefore we were quite disappointed when we found out that it was made in China.  We could probably have bought it cheaper in the local Chinese grocery store.  We tried it and it was both very gingery and sugary.  All you could taste was a full month of sugar and it was so HOT.  The ginger also came in small cubes and they should call it candied ginger.  Some were quite tough.  In short, I was not very impressed with this product.  We could probably purchase better products in the local Whole Food.  We were also skeptical with it being Organic since it was made in China where the standard for ""organic' can be substantially different that that of the States."
71971,B001E5DX4A,A21LWLPLPA3B88,2/7/11,1,2,2,Tastes just like Raisin Bran cereal!!!,"After reading the reviews, I was expecting this cereal to tastes like great Muesli and was I wrong.  It's just like Raisin Bran....where's all of the fruit and yummy taste? I should've been more careful before ordering this.  Now I have a whole caseload of this stuff.  Well, at least it's edible and not terrible for cereal, but it's not great for Muesli for sure."
71979,B000E0TLEW,A1WINBPELZ0YAZ,2/7/08,2,4,2,Everlasting?  I don't know about that!,"One of my dogs (8 lbs)was able to remove the treat disc from the ball and promptly made a huge icky mess on their futon:(  The other pup (3.75 lbs) isn't as agressive a chewer, so it's fine for her.  I just have to figure out how to give it to the little one without the big one stealing it from her, lol!"
71994,B007K449CE,A1HNE9Y9JBAN9Y,5/31/12,2,4,2,"No better...no worse...than regular shampoo...for us, at least","First, to the efficacy of the product:<br />It leaves a filmy coating on our hands (and, we assume, other skin areas, including scalp) even after many rinsings...not a pleasant feeling...and yet, we do not notice any real difference in dandruff control. We used it every other day for a week.<br /><br />In addition, the scent is very strong...and some may find it unappealing.<br /><br />Finally, as at least one other reviewer has noted, the packaging does not hold up well in transit: our sample arrived in a padded yellow envelope via USPS and was leaking all over the place. We thought it was inadvertently damaged during shipping...and disposed of it; Amazon very nicely shipped another one out, but that, too arrived in a leaky mess. This time, we cleaned it off and proceeded to test it out, with the above results. So, if someone does order it online, just be aware that this might be an issue.<br /><br />So, overall, we cannot fully recommend ""CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full"" based on experience, but as with any product like this, it might produce better results for others, so it might be worth a try. Just be careful with the shipping, and maybe wait for a decent price for the first time around."

It even had his straight hair curling up a bit. My son didn't like the feeling, even after washing it off, it didn't immediately go away.<br /><br />The smell in the bottle had a strong ""manly"" scent, but on his head-I guess it didn't agree with his body chemistry...the smell wasn't as delightful.<br /><br />For fuller, already strong hair...we recommend another shampoo in the line (the cool mint by same maker worked great!)"

It's thick and rich enough that a little is all you need to use, and it stays in your palm until you smack it on your noggin and start scrubbing. I also give points for the bottle design, which is easy to grip, squeeze, and close with one hand.<br /><br />Despite being an anti-dandruff shampoo, it doesn't feel harsh - nor does it have a medicinal smell. In fact, despite some reviews mentioning the perfuming ingredients, I didn't really pick up a strong scent at all.<br /><br />As far as its ability to control dandruff and flaking, I'm not particularly knocked out. Perhaps it's effective if such flaking is only from dry skin, as the shampoo seems like more of a moisturizer than medication. But for that same reason, it leaves my hair feeling slightly greasy (albeit looking nice). Overall not a bad shampoo, but not my first choice for actual treatment of an active dandruff problem."

It causes my scalp to itch for about an hour after I use it.  I also used it to wash my sideburns which was not a good idea as it dried out my face and caused me to itch there also.  While my hair did feel clean, it also cause it to become poofy and not lay flat.  I don't have terrible dandruff so I am not sure if it is more effective for a person with bad dandruff.  Overall, I would not recommend this product and I probably won't even end up finishing the bottle."

Assuming traditional month-day-year dating, that's almost four months past. Even if it's day-month-year dating, it's still close. I would not have even questioned the age of the product if the sticker wasn't there, but why add a 'best by' sticker if it's not needed...and why send it out if it's out of it's freshness period? Because I'm not the one consuming the product, I can't say if the product is bad or not, but I did notice that so far only ONE out of three of the treats I've used actually fits in the Romp n Chomp bone that I bought it for. This totally defeats the purpose of challenging the dog and giving him a treat that takes time to consume when I leave. Instead he grabs the refill treat and wolfs it down. Disappointing since he otherwise likes the bone. I'd hoped to be able to use it as intended with a treat insert once in awhile."

""Foglifter"" implied that it might have a nice kick to it.  Second, the reviews I'd seen (forget if the reviews were here or another site) were encouraging.<br /><br />The flavor is good, but it's very weak.  I feel like if I could take two k-cups to brew one cup of coffee, then I might be happier.<br /><br />I like a more robust coffee - like a Jet Fuel or a Dark Magic... or an Italian Roast or sometimes even a French Roast.<br /><br />If you're looking for a milder brew, this is very good.

I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them."

I purchased the Original Mild and the Teriyaki flavors.<br /><br />The texture of these is spot on if you like toughier jerky (I do), although the outside has a weird sort of clumpy coating. Unfortunately, the taste is TERRIBLE. Both varieties honestly tasted like dog food. I also had two friends (one recently vegetarian, the other not) try them, and they said exactly the same thing. My friend's toddler-aged son loved them, though.<br /><br />I liked these even less than the Primal strips, and would not recommend them."

It is a little too dry and chewy, and has a weird aftertaste. I have not tried the other versions of this jerky. If you prefer a dry and chewy veggie jerky, I would go with the Vegan Dream brand. They have a sampler pack, with 6 different flavors. Also, as I follow weight watchers online, the 1.5 oz package has 4 points, with 8 grams of fat, 152 calories, 3 grams of fiber.

Tea is not too bad, perhaps a bit bland, but not so weak as to warrent two bags per cup. Tea is no worse than Twinings or other mass market products, certainly drinkable and packets are portable and simple to use.  This is no where near the caliber of most loose teas.  One product I do recommend is Kusmi Anastasia tea.<br /><br />As a footnote, I would warn you against purchasing loose tea from Tea District.  I generally purchase by the pound and ordered a pound of tea before I was in dire need of a refill.  After it arrived I stored it in my dry cool basement until it was needed.  In the time it took me to finish my current batch, the tea district tea spoiled - the sealed mylar bag smelled of spoiled oranges or rotten feet or maybe both.  Tasted about as bad too.  Company told me I waited more than 30 days to complain so it's my problem.  Wasn't cheap and wasn't consumable.

Every day they dry cough and choke, especially my cat with allergies who will only eat the dry food and therefore consumes the most. Even the 10-week old kittens who are short-haired are coughing a little bit. My adult cats are vomiting hairballs now too. Not only is this alarming, but it necessitates the need for a hairball remedy. I should also include that IAMS indoor hairball dry food is what I was feeding when my cat showed symptoms of allergies to food. I am not even sure I will get through the rest of the bag, I might just throw it out. I don't wish all that coughing on strays, shelter cats, or rats.<br /><br />The reason I gave two stars -- this food has helped with my cat's allergies. His coat is shinier and his skin is not flaky.

In general, he's got a touchier stomach than a lot of other dogs, so maybe it's just him.

I suspect that it must be the Peanut butter flavoring.  He's always eaten meat or vegetable flavored food and treats, and the peanut butter must be throwing him.

This was the only thing that was different in their diet unless they got hold of a neighborhood toddler I do not know about. I hate to give a treat a bad review, because I know the people work hard to make a good product and no one sat around and said, ""Well, so what if it makes a few dogs barf!

It's tasteless.<br /><br />I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly ""bite of cheese"" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.

My cockapoo is more of a picky eater, so you really have to try hard to find anything she'll try. When the package of treats arrived, I made a big show of opening them for the dogs who were very excited to see what they'd be getting. They readily took a treat each and promptly dropped them on the floor. I picked one up to try to give it to the cockapoo and she took off down the stairs and out the dog door. Turning to my springer who, as I said, never turns down anything edible (in her opinion), I tried to coax her into giving it another try. Being a sport, she took it in her mouth once again then trotted away and dropped it. She came back as if asking, ""okay, so now where are the real treats."" I finally gave up trying to coax either dog to bite into the treats and just left them laying on the floor for them when they wanted them. Yeah, that never happened. I can understand my cockapoo not eating the treats because she's really picky, but my springer not enjoying them shocked me. They smell like normal dog treats to me! No, I did not try them and nor will I ever be tempted to taste a dog treat. I do plan on trying them out on other dogs and will post an update if one of the pups actually eats one.

This is pretty important, because our boys will eat nearly anything! These were a nice size for small or large dogs, but neither seemed interested, despite that fact.

Real coconut is very mild and subtle and does not taste like this. This product is overly sweet and the taste was not at all like the coconut waters I've had from Vita Coco, Zico, or canned ones from Asia. There's only 10% coconut water in here, from concentrate. The rest is water, sugar, stevia, and some other ingredients like potassium chloride and gum arabic. Fortunately, all of it's natural.<br /><br />Unlike real coconut water, you also don't get any of the potassium kick. It's only 5% of your daily value. I got this at my local drugstore for less than $1. Don't order it from the current seller. That price is ridiculous.<br /><br />Glad I tried it once, but won't be buying this again."

If there were more meats and less fillers I would be more pleased with this product. I have a beagle puppy who chows this product down, however, this really means nothing. Just because your dog eats it doesn't make it good for them.

So it may have been my fault, but the finished biscuits were flat, chewy and very dense (almost like a cookie).  I would think they should have risen a LITTLE more than that, even if rolled too thin.  Also, I would recommend SALTED butter rather than unsalted -- they definitely needed more salt.  Another thing -- unless you have a food processor with a very large bowl, don't try to do these in the processor.  My machine is about a 3 cup capacity and it just wasn't breaking up the butter, so I had to dump it all into a bowl and make them by hand.  What a mess!"

I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open.  I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips.  They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.<br /><br />I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude.  The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier.  Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.

And, I think, for the price, you aren't getting anywhere near enough product.  A twelve oz. bag of this stuff is about the equivalent of a 2/3rds full sandwich bag.  I was quite disappointed overall."
73891,B001E5E3IA,A3UVTS6JPKW0GX,7/18/08,3,6,2,tastes good but....,the reason I am giving this product a 2 is that it claims on the packet that it does not cause the digestive probs that similar products can cause.  For me this was untrue!  I had 2 cups of coffee w/ a spoon and a half of Zero.  This was followed by stomach cramps and a quick short-lived bout of diarrhea.  I get the same symptoms when i eat too many grapes.  Maybe the sugar has a similar composition?<br /><br />The taste was good and I liked the fact that it wasn't as sweet as sugar.  If i hadn't had the digestive probs I would be buying more of this product.
73905,B004JRKEH4,AVYVPMAO26YDV,10/17/11,0,0,2,For Taco Bell Fans Only,"This review applies both to the ""Chipotle"" and the ""Spicy Ranchero"" flavors, neither of which tastes much like anything identifiable. The base is a thin mayonnaise made from soybean oil, chemically dyed to vivid and rather odd colors. To that are added various natural and artificial flavors to create a strong, though only moderately spicy, flavor.<br /><br />This isn't really a sauce and it isn't very Mexican. What it is is the sort of bright-color/strong-flavor condiment that kids like to squirt over everything. Juvenile palates are evidently what it's intended for. Since that describes the clientele Taco Bell targets, it should go over well with them."
73923,B004JRKEH4,AT28RL25Q2OLK,10/8/11,0,0,2,Not much to say,"Clearly, this sauce provides an alternative to traditional non-franchised sauces.  It's a runny salad dressing that has some tang and a lot of calories. Whereas adults will find the taste, color, and texture largely unappealing, children may like it based on their experiences with Taco Bell.  This sauce is not ""hot"" by any measure and not even close to any real Mexican sauces. I consider myself a fan of real Mexican food having lived in San Diego for 13 years.  This sauce is garbage compared to what any small restaurant or even street vendor on the border can produce.<br /><br />As with any processed food, the nutritional value is horrible and I doubt I will use it again.  In 2 TBSP, which is not a lot, you will consume 110 calories, 300mg sodium, and 11g of fat.  Who eats this stuff? These nutritional facts do not seem apparent on the Amazon product page.<br /><br />Bottom line- if you your eating habits are garbage, this sauce fits right in.  If you try and eat healthy, stay away. You will find very little return in terms of taste versus nutrition."
73978,B004JRKEH4,AC6LV5D2RKTIR,8/31/11,0,0,2,Not really bold,"To give you an insight into how bold this sauce is, I recently bought some Kraft Chipotle Mayonnaise and the mayo was much spicier than this sauce. I like the taco sauce that you get in the restaurants and thought this would be similar, but it's a far cry from the packets. The smokiness is a little too fake and the aftertaste is off-putting. I know some may consider this a small thing to complain about, but the mouth of the bottle is the size of a salad dressing bottle, so you have to be careful when pouring or it gets all over. That is not something many people necessarily want, especially since the recommended two tablespoon serving size is 110 calories and 11 grams of fat."
73991,B004JRKEH4,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,8/27/11,0,0,2,Somewhat Bland,"I am a big fan of the sauces from Taco Bell and assumed this was like them, but it isn't.  Not to say the sauce isn't good, its just not what I expected or had a taste for.  The flavor is not really chipotle, but somewhat dry and bland.  Not hot at all if you are looking for spice.  So far we have only tried on tacos and won't be buying another bottle.  It was different and worth trying, but again not typical Taco Bell."
74000,B004JRKEH4,A2DB720I9XRX7K,8/24/11,0,0,2,tastes smokey and artificial,"we tried the product on tacos and on taco salad, and it did not impress. Too many artificial ingredients make it taste dull and not fresh. Oddly bacon-like. I prefer plain salsa, green chilies, fresh guacamole, or sour cream (I substitute Greek yogurt; just as creamy, but less fat). For the chipotle flavor, I will try a home-made from scratch sauce."
74002,B004JRKEH4,A293HA28PN3VO4,8/23/11,0,0,2,A little too smokey for my taste!,"We used this sauce on tacos and as a dipping sauce. Though I am a big fan of Mexican food, I found the smokiness of the sauce to be overwhelming to the rest of the food. I could not taste the rest of the food. I would imagine, however, that if diluted in sour cream, the smokiness would serve as a compliment to chicken. I have to admit that I experiment a lot with dressings, sauces, spices, etc of different brands, and it's possible that the strength of ""chipotle"" flavored ingredients is simply not appealing to me. If you do try this, I'd use only a bit, to test the waters-the flavor and smell went right up my nose."
74006,B004JRKEH4,A23GS4UGLQBG2V,8/4/11,3,3,2,Pointless fat and calories,"Taco Bell's Chipotle sauce is the texture of a weak ranch dressing. Possibly due to this texture, the flavor vaguely reminds me of ranch dressing with some Mexican spices added. It isn't very spicy hot. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest thing I've eaten, I'd put this sauce around 3. It is about as spicy as a typical packaged taco seasoning from a kit.<br /><br />I tried the sauce seperately, on a bit of taco meat, and buried in a taco. I can't say that it ever tasted good, but it wasn't too bad when it was only providing a hint of flavor to the taco. I'd much rather have salsa or any of the great liquid hot sauces available online or at the supermarket.<br /><br />According to the label, it has 110 calories and 11g of fat in a 2-Tbsp serving. The top ingredient is soybean oil. It says ""contain milk, egg"" in the allergen section of the label."
74008,B004JRKEH4,A26DQMYF5E0GL6,11/20/11,1,1,2,Meh...,Tasted kind of like old Ranch dressing.  Boring and fairly unoffensive.  Unmemorable.  Creamy? Yes. Bold? Not so much.<br /><br />I'm not really sure where this item fits into your condiment selections.  Salad dressing? Not really.  Salsa? No.  On tacos?  Maybe soft tacos...?  Creamy tacos?  That doesn't really fit either.  Might do alright on a hamburger.  I wasn't able to try that out before the item expired.  Not spicy enough to replace salsa or tabasco.  I can't recommend this.
74015,B004JRKEH4,AC1YLEFC9AN5X,8/23/11,0,0,2,Not what I was hoping for,"I tried the Taco Bell Chipotle sauce on my tacos the other night and did not like the flavor at all.  Previously I had tried the Jalapeno sauce and enjoyed it for being different from my regular taco sauce.  Not something I would use a lot but maybe every once it a while.  The chipotle sauce, on the other hand, tasted like a ranch style dressing with a bit of smoke flavor added it.  I was hoping for more of a real chipotle flavor like I've tasted from other sauces like the Tabasco Chipotle sauce.  I doubt I will use this sauce again."
74022,B004JRKEH4,A23KDA686N6T4Y,8/19/11,0,0,2,Doesnt know what it wants to be,"Well, honestly i didnt know what chipotle was before i got this. But i like sauces and so i just decided to give this a try...but unfortunately this product hasnt left a good impression of chipotle in me.<br />The flavor is some weird mix between spicy and sweet. Your initial taste is of sweetness and then your left with a spicy aftertaste. I had liked the mild sweetness initially. Its also got a smoky flavor in the spicy aftertaste similar to BBQ sauces. But the taste overall is just weak and undistinguishable (unless you put a big chunk in there).<br />On top of the weak taste, it gives you a fair amount fat/calories per serving(110 calories and 11g fat for 2 tablespoons) for a sauce. Personally, i say stay away from this."
74055,B004JRKEH4,A2PU80LCKRMC9X,8/9/11,0,0,2,Ok but nothing to write home about.,"This might be ok for ""taco night"" for dinner but other than that this is nothing to write home about. I've tasted other chipotle sauces that are much better than this. This definitely needs some work if they want people to buy this on a regular basis. Why some reviewers are raving and giving this 5 star reviews I have no idea why they would praise something like this."
74060,B004JRKEH4,A2F540P3L6P5CL,8/7/11,0,0,2,A bit underwhelmed,"There really wasn't a lot of heat in this one for me, although I do like things hotter than most folks. I don't have Mexican food (or chips) in the house or eat it on regular occasions so I haven't been able to sample try this product out on them. I did try it as a condiment to my ever-so-boring turkey and it was OK, but I prefer the spicy mustards instead. I did try some today in a salad and that was OK, but not one I'd recommend or use again. The product has an oily texture/taste to it, and if I was going to go for something so fatty I think I'd prefer it to be a sour cream base instead of oil base.<br /><br />If you aren't worried about fat and calories and eat a lot of Mexican food products this might suit, but otherwise I'd give it a pass. There's not enough flavor to make it worth the added calories for me."
74064,B004JRKEH4,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,8/5/11,0,0,2,"Processed Taste, Almost All Fat, Too Strong Smoke Taste","In my personal opinion, this is basically an overly processed fatty salad dressing made from a soybean oil base. I love Mexican food generally and salads, but was put off by the label showing such a high fat content (11 grams for just a couple tablespoons) and also the chemical preservatives listed on the label that I cannot pronounce.  I tasted a wee bit on my finger and was kind of shocked by that strong ""natural smoke flavor"" and the vinegary, salty and bitter taste on my tongue. I noticed a little chili heat, which I like.  Since I was making homemade tostadas with fresh chopped lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onions, guacamole, pico, sour cream and beans on a corn tortilla, I thought this would be the perfect compliment. All I can say is that for me it is not worth the dietary failings of the product as I don't like the strong smoke taste, even once tossed with alot of fresh ingredients, and it is high in fat and preserved.  I would much rather spice up my fresh guacamole with cayenne/chili and know that the fat I am getting is a more healthful type.  I will not be buying this product."
74085,B004JRKEH4,A1CFU5XJXN3PV4,9/21/11,1,2,2,Very Colorful...Not Very Tasty,"Tasting a dab of this on a fingertip wasn't too pleasing: it felt too rich, too fake, and too underspiced (basically thousand island dressing with a slight aftertaste of chipotle).<br /><br />So I tried adding it to some food, and in most cases I couldn't even tell it was in there - with the exception that my burrito made orange drips on the plate.<br /><br />I'm sure I could get more of a taste profile (and more orange drips) if I added a LOT more of the sauce to my food...but that would boost the calorie count unacceptably. All in all, Taco Bell might do well to change the name from ""Bold & Creamy"" to ""Bland & Fatty."""

If you don't care how many calories you pour over your food, and that those calories are all fat calories, you won't care that this is so incredibly high in both.<br /><br />I don't like hot stuff.  A little bit of tang is a good thing, but all I tasted in this is hot.  I really didn't taste the flavor at all.<br /><br />This is a pass for me."

I've had some Chipotle Ranch sauce that was good and so I thought this might be worth a try. My family did not care for it. It didn't taste like real chipotle but I guess I shouldn't be surprised because Taco Bell isn't real mexican food (to me). I wouldn't recommend this if you are at true chipotle lover

I've been waiting all year for Valentines day so I can go out of control and eat these things for no apparent reason. I purchased six of this exact product in this exact size (7oz) and label: five from one supermarket and one from another. The candy seems stale. The purple ones are rock hard and I'm afrade I'll break a tooth so I throw those away, and the green ones are almost as bad so I've given up on them. That leaves the yellow, pink, orange (usually) and blue ones as safe to eat. These aren't supposed to be hard candy, are they?<br /><br />The Necco web site says these hearts are produced all year for sale during the Valentines holiday period. They are supposed to be soft candy. So it seems that you may get a bag from eleven months ago or a couple weeks ago. Good luck! I think I got the from spring 2011.<br /><br />By the way, I got my 7 oz bags for only a fraction of the coin demanded here, so best to look at the grocery store in the seasonal items area first.<br /><br />Also, I bought a bag of the Brach's Conversation Hearts and did a comparison. The Brach's product seemed fresh with no rock hard hearts, but the flaver is a bit more bland. It's difficult to tell if the different color Brach's hearts are meant to be different flavors.

I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing."

Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth...  just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie...  that's all."

However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up."

I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews."

The ingredient list was amazing and the price was reasonable.  However, not one of my five cats will touch it -- and none of them have ever been finicky eaters.  I see that other reviewers have cats that love it, but I wish I had tried it with my cats before I invested in a large bag.  Live and learn!"
75354,B001E5E0YW,A22BGI38W7Q9X9,6/22/12,1,2,2,Felt sticky on my teeth and like cement in my tummy,"I bought this by mistake. I thought it was made from whole grain brown rice, my bad. I had it before (fusili, same ingredients) and didn't like it then but I tried it again anyway. In short, due to the texture, questionable healthiness factor, and price, as a pasta loving Italian-American, if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. But I give them kudos for trying. My full review is below. This review will not show as a verified Amazon purchase because I bought mine locally but I include photos too, partly to prove I bought it, partly to show I threw it in the garbage after my taste test.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />> Thick. The actual wall of the pasta is simply too thick. I felt it should be thinner for better mouth feel.<br /><br />> Tacky, sticky, chewy, just plain icky. It was so chewy, sticking to my teeth, I felt like I was biting into a mushy granola bar or candy bar. I tried taste testing it at 8 minutes cooking time, 9 minutes, 10, 11, and 12 minutes. Recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but I tried all of them because I did buy this in the past and didn't like the texture then, so I wanted to give it every opportunity to cook properly this time. It was bad at all cooking times but it was most palatable at 12 minutes of a full rolling boil in plenty of water.<br /><br />> They claim it has a true al dente pasta-like texture. Well, I'm an Italian from NY and have been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years and this isn't like any pasta I've tried before, home made or store bought. So no, I don't think it gives ""true pasta-like"" texture as they claim. As I mention above, sticky icky.<br /><br />> It sat like a led weight in my stomach after eating about 2 ounces (dry weight) with home made fresh tomato sauce. Horrible feeling in my stomach even an hour later, like I'd just swallowed wet cement. I'm sure it will constipate me just like eating too much white bread so I just downed a fiber drink to help it move through me as fast as possible.<br /><br />> Not made from whole grain brown rice, it's white, which I feel means it's not really that healthy for you. But that's not the reason I gave it just 2 stars. It's not advertised as whole grain or brown rice so I wouldn't take away stars due to this. I just don't think people should eat white rice if they can get whole grain brown rice instead.<br /><br />> Made from rice, potato, and soy. The Potato is white, just like the rice. And soy, well more and more we're finding out too much soy in the diet is not good for you. For centuries soy was mainly used as a seasoning, it's only in modern times food manufacturer's are trying to shove it down our throats in any form they can. I feel the combination of white rice, white starchy potato and questionable soy is just too much for me to recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it.<br /><br />> Expensive. I purchased mine at a local store for $3.99 (one 12 ounce bag). Compared to regular pasta, which you can buy for about .75 per 16 ounces on sale. I honestly don't think it's worth the money. Currently sold here for $4.26 per bag ($25.56 for 6 bags, less if you use Amazon Prime). If you have already tried this stuff and like it and don't mind paying four times the price of regular pasta, and can't get it locally, then Amazon Prime is the way to go. Ask me how to get Amazon Prime free shipping perks. I tend to think most specialty food items are over priced because the manufacturer thinks they can price their items high, but maybe bionaturae (being relatively small family owned company) is so small that they need to price items so high to make a profit. Not sure, but either way I don't see it being worth the price.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />> Organic<br /><br />> Gluten Free<br /><br />> Kosher (circle K symbol)<br /><br />> Produced at a dedicated gluten free facility with no risk of cross contamination with dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, or eggs.<br /><br />> The manufacturer is one of a select few in Italy who are authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health to produce gluten free pasta. The factory tests for the presence of gluten during each production cycle. Independent testing is also done at a laboratory in the United States on each lot before the products are distributed in this country.<br /><br />> The actual taste is a little like regular pasta. But I'm being generous saying this since the texture was so bad I nearly gagged on it.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Organic Rice Flour, Organic Rice Starch, Organic Potato Starch, Organic Soy Flour<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL FACTS:<br /><br />Serving Size: 2 ounces<br />Servings per container: 6<br /><br />Calories: 200<br />Calories From Fat: 10<br />Total Fat: 1g<br />Saturated Fat: 0<br />Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 0<br />Sodium: 0<br />Total Carbs: 42g (14% daily recommended amount)<br />Dietary Fiber 2g (doubtful)<br />Sugars: 1g<br />Protein: 5g<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />COMPANY INFORMATION:<br /><br />Euro-USA Trading Co., Inc.

I am not a coffee lover which i am assuming you would almost have to be since this tastes very similar to coffee. I do like chocolate but this was a tad overpowering.

I have always shied away from them before because of the vitaminy taste that remains after consuming one.  This particular dring tasted of tangerines and did have the vitamin taste but it was not overpowering while drinking it and went down smoothly.  I am an ardent coffee-drinker and have the benefits of drinking coffee to keep me awake works far better than any energy drink.  I was hoping that the No Fear would prove me wrong but, unfortunately I was left with the same aftertaste and little to no energy boost.  I would not recommend it more than I would any other energy drink brand."
75634,B004MO6NI8,A2BPB05QNCE00B,3/14/12,0,0,2,Not For Me,"I was really excited to try this and I work at 3 am once a week. I usually take an AMP energy drink with me which I enjoy and works quite well, but I thought I would try this one. It was not a good experience for me. The morning that I drank it, I really needed. I did not get much sleep at all (probably about 2 hours) and I was tired. I started sipping on the the drink and I started feeling nauseous. I don't know if the nausea was because I was really tired (I tend to get nauseous whe I'm tired) or if it was from the drink itself (after I read the label I saw it had 1,000mg of Taurine compared to the 173mg in the AMP. But I decided to stop drinking it and switched to an AMP afterwards and my nausea went away.<br /><br />So, this is not a drink that I will have again, and I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get the chance to see if it actually worked or not. But compared to other energy drinks, the taste wasn't that bad. It wasn't my favorite, but it was a lot better tasting than other drinks that are on the market."
75663,B004MO6NI8,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,3/4/12,0,0,2,"OK drink, ambiguous flavor","I was given one can of ""No Fear, Super Energy"" to try out for this review.  At the outset I should say that I am not a regular energy drink fan, though I have indulged on occasion, largely out of necessity, when I was desperate for energy or forced to stay awake all night.  I have always viewed such drinks as a little bit dangerous and largely a necessary evil but one that is clearly needed during this day and age.  I've never been a fan of the taste, but it's difficult to argue with the burst of energy that such drinks provide.  That said, this ""No Fear"" big can -- each can containts two servings -- was just OK, no better and no worse than any of the other drinks I have occasionally tried and largely disliked over the years.<br /><br />A few reviewers have described the taste as cola-like or even fruity, and I think that says a lot about the rather, well, ambiguous flavor.  The one thing that I can certainly agree with is the utterly unpleasant aftertaste that tingles like a vitamin or pill that you accidentally bit into before swallowing.  Now, did it increase my energy?  Of course, as any huge jolt of caffeine to my system would do.  Would I try it again?  Well, as I said, I'm not a fan of energy drinks but recognize the occasional need for one.  If I was in need and ""No Fear"" was handy, sure, I'd drink it again.  Would I choose it over another brand?  No.  There is no real difference in my opinion.  Of course, if you're a fan of energy drinks -- as many of these reviewers are -- your mileage may vary.  This might be the best or worst tasting energy drink ever.  Much like the flavor, it's all very ambiguous."
75674,B004MO6NI8,A1VK6EKINVYAT7,3/1/12,0,0,2,A teenagers perspective - just so so,"My 16 year old daughter is the queen of energy drinks.  I thought that she would be the perfect person to try this drink.  Unfortunately, she only took a sip and gave it back to me.  She said that it had almost no carbonation and tasted like grapefruit.  I decided that I would have to try it too.  Unfortunately, I had to agree with her on this one.  Although the carbonation part did not bother me (I am not fond of carbonated drinks), it did taste kind of like grapefruit...only it was sort of an ""off"" grapefruit and left a bit of a nasty after taste.  I am not sure that I would buy it again."
75681,B004MO6NI8,A26LD9FQHTM8ZH,2/28/12,0,0,2,More energy or just a sugar high?,"This did give me more energy, but it was very short lived and had me wondering if it was just a sugar high because this one can packs in 66 g of sugar!  Total calories per can are 260 and total carbs 68g.  Add in the fact that the second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup and that it contains soy and it's a guarantee I won't pick up another can.  Gaining short lived energy isn't worth it to me to put that kind of garbage and empty calories into my body."
75701,B004MO6NI8,A1SCANWWQTEG9I,2/21/12,0,0,2,A distant runner up to Monster,Not a fan of No Fear. It has a very sweet & fruity soda flavor with an unpleasant aftertaste. It left me feeling dehydrated and cotton-mouthed instead of refreshed and energized.<br /><br />Energy drinks for me are few and far between. I will continue to stick with Monster on the occasions I pick one up though.
75729,B004MO6NI8,A4IL0CLL27Q33,3/20/12,1,2,2,I will stick with 5-hour Energy Drinks,"I usually drink a 5-hour Energy drink<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GX1K14"">5-Hour Energy Extra Strength (24 Bottles Grape)</a> when I first get up so that I can quickly get in to my morning P90X routine. I put one on my nightstand before going to bed and quickly drink it down in the morning. I don't much care for the taste (though I don't exactly hate it) but I like the effect of energy drinks on my exercise performance, and that is why I decided to give this No Fear drink a try. I was disappointed and will stick with 5-Hour Energy. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1 - Calories: At 260 calories a can, there is a 65X difference. It does not fit in with my nutrition goals.<br /><br />2 - Taste: It's a little sweeter than a Red Bull. I don't much like Red Bull though and the flavor of No Fear was not an improvement over 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />3 - Size: This is a BIG can yet it has roughly the same amount of caffeine, taurine, etc as 5-Hour Energy. Why drink this massive can of fluid when a small shot will do? If I REALLY enjoyed the taste, I might feel otherwise.<br /><br />4 - Energy Boost: I found the effect of No Fear to be similar to that of 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />Bottom line: 5-Hour Energy works better for me."
75733,B004MO6NI8,AWPODHOB4GFWL,3/2/12,1,2,2,Not Pricey; Foul Taste,"`No Fear, Super Energy' is a big claim when there are so many energy drinks out there.  For about less than three bucks a can, it competitive in price, but I have to be honest.  The taste was bad.  It was like a chemical peach flavor without much fizz.  I am sensitive to caffeine and Taurine, but really did not feel much of a boost.  If you like your vitamins, there is plenty of Vitamin C, B6 and B12.  The calorie intake is 260 a can!  I think I will stick to Red Bull or RockStar, even if they cost a little more."
75735,B004MO6NI8,A3Q4TYJVAM4IRM,2/28/12,1,2,2,"Shareable size, but flavor is meh and no kick?","This large (16oz) two-serving can is big enough to share, and has some ingredients not found in my usual energy drink (Redbull) such as L-Carnitine.  But I found the flavor lackluster, the calorie count high, and somehow I didn't get the bit of a buzz that I normally get from an equivalent amount of Redbull.<br /><br />I've had Redbull in many conditions and combinations and always enjoy it (and always notice a bit of a perk, if not an outright buzz).  There wasn't any similar effect that I noticed from drinking a serving of this NoFear on an empty stomach.  Redbull hardly tastes natural, but this stuff tastes...weird, like flat RC Cola mixed with something.<br /><br />Comparing labels, the NoFear claims slightly higher caffeine content (87g vs 80g) than an 8.4oz Redbull, but also has more calories/carbs.  For a class of product that's already heavy on sugar, adding even more doesn't seem wise.<br /><br />It comes down to that I didn't think ""that was tasty!"", nor did I feel energized. Flavor preferences are personal, and I'm sure some people will get a caffeine jolt from NoFear, but for my tastes, Not Recommended."
75736,B004MO6NI8,A2503LT8PZIHAD,2/28/12,1,2,2,"Oily Kool-Aid (Sorry, Kool-Aid)","No Fear has soy in it.<br /><br />The initial flavor in this was not too bad.  I don't know that I have ever liked one on the first try - even my favorite sugar free Red Bull.  The initial flavor wasn't too terrible, but then it had a sour aftertaste.  It has a seriously chemical flavor to it and a slippery, kind of oily, feel to it - kind of like pouring gasoline in kool-aid.<br /><br />The problem for me was the excess carbonation.  Take a drink, burp.  Take a drink, burp.  Not something to drink in polite company.<br /><br />Then there is the sugar and the serving size.  I don't know why manufacturers say that 16 oz is 2 servings.  Maybe so that we think there are 130 calories?  There aren't.  There are 260 calories. That's more than my morning omelet.<br /><br />In any case, I wouldn't buy a case of any energy drink without trying one first."
75749,B004MO6NI8,A3NO9NOCWLFAAJ,3/20/12,0,1,2,Not the energizer bunny!!,This has a really nice flavor and is not  too carbonated but it did absolutely nothing to my energy level! This is the first time I have tried a product like this. I tried it because I work nights and wanted a little energy boost to help get me through  til quitting time!  I think a little extra caffiene will work and be less expensive.
75751,B004MO6NI8,A30IP3E4MDQ36,3/18/12,0,1,2,Look elsewhere...,"I'm a fan of most energy drinks, but No Fear's Super Energy is not impressive.<br /><br />Each can contains two servings, each serving being 130 calories and 33 grams of sugar, and only 90 milligrams of caffeine. For me that is a lot of empty calories and not a whole lot of ""energy"" to be honest with you.<br /><br />Taste wise it's actually quite pleasant. Drink it super chilled or iced and it's refreshing.<br /><br />Energy wise, it's not even close to my standard <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001534R00"">Celsius</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VMVOF8"">GURU </a> that I drink.<br /><br />If you're not too concerned about calories and want something a bit different than coffee in the morning, give it a shot.<br />If you're wanting some energy and not a bunch of sugar, I'd recommend taking a look at the two products mentioned above."

I was stoked to try it out because I really enjoy energy drinks.  I didn't care for the juice taste and it was too sweet.  The ""juice"" taste was too overwhelming for my taste buds and it made me feel loggy instead of refreshed.  You can taste the HFCS in the drink and it taints the product in my book. The sticky sweet taste ruins what could have been a really good energy supplement.  The crash I had afterwards was even worse.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good energy drink I advise you to look elsewhere.  I do not recommend No Fear."
75761,B004MO6NI8,A27HB4L3I1WJUR,3/5/12,0,1,2,not the best,"This drink is so ""super energy"" it's almost frightening.  Several members of my family tasted it and the consensus was that it might, indeed, give you a boost but the taste...some even compared it to grapefruit juice...was  definitely not good."
75763,B004MO6NI8,A3ITL5EYKTZTF0,2/29/12,0,1,2,Too many calories and too strong a taste...,"I was looking forward to trying NO FEAR ENERGY DRINK because I definitely could benefit from a daily energy drink, and this one was recommended by a friend. But I found it much too strong, and grimaced after the first sip.<br /><br />As a person who loves to eat lemons whole, I've never avoided strong, fruity flavors, but NO FEAR ENERGY DRINK has a pronounced pineapple taste (with a touch of grapefruit and grape), and pineapple in particular has never appealed to me.<br /><br />I had to force myself to drink half a can, which I discovered later, is 130 calories. The entire 160 ounce can is 260 calories, containing a whopping 66 grams of sugar. That's considerably more calories than I use up in a workout.<br /><br />On a positive note, an 8 ounce serving does fulfill 100% of the daily requirement for vitamins C, B6 and B12, and 10% for folic acid, zinc and selenium. It also contains soy, and traces of sodium and potassium.<br /><br />Additional elements in the drink are difficult to determine from the can, as the print on it is not only small - it is too thick to be readable. I was able to find out however that the primary ingredients are high fructose corn syrup and carbonated water. It also contains l-carnitine, which has definite health benefits (I take it daily for hyperthyroidism), as well as grape seed extract, targine and argine. It appears to have few preservatives.<br /><br />I did not notice any difference in my energy level the hour after drinking it. But five minutes afterwards, I experienced a bout of frequent burping.<br /><br />Personally, I would not drink NO FEAR ENERGY drink again. But taste is subjective, and people who like the flavor and do not mind all the calories might enjoy it. My inclination, however, is to stick with my favorite drink, glaceau vitamin water zero (acai blueberry or mixed berry) which is delicious, nutritious and calorie- free, and leaves me feeling clear-headed and motivated."

A smattering of vitamins. Yes it will keep you awake. And yes you will inevitably crash from it. (I did.) It does taste better than red bull and about the same as Rock Star. But seriously, 2 of these day as some people reported seems to be putting you on track for health problems. And why in the world does an energy drink need a skull on the front? I downed my can before doing an MMA session. The guys in my class were not extra intimidated when they saw the skull. (Bummer.) I did not have any greater than usual work out ability. Time did not slow down. UFC fighters and BJJ black belts did not run away in fear.<br /><br />This really isnt a bad drink, I was just hoping for something different or better or healthier than EVERY OTHER energy drink out there. Instead it just seems to be trying to cash in on some sort of bad a$$ mystique. While pumping you full of carbonated water, HFC and citric acid. (Also contains Soy?!?)  I'm going to stick with black coffee, green tea, yerba mate, exercise and multivitamins for my caffeine, energy and supplement needs."

The after taste was not bad and in this form the syrup did not get that bad feel in your mouth like some of these do. But the ingredient list is outrageous with so many bad things and the highest volume of sugar I have seen in one of these drinks (over 65g). The syrup is high fructose corn, and the preservatives and colors just make it worse.<br /><br />I know this drink is sought after as referenced in so many reviews here, but the sugar content and syrup definitely left a bad feeling in my stomach...will not be drinking it again. The cost is too high for this much bad stuff and I could feel it (in a bad way)."
75773,B004MO6NI8,A3IMO49QD6OYKN,3/11/12,1,3,2,"Big on sugar, low on ... everything else","Go to any grocery store, gas station or nutrition shop, and you will no doubt be overwhelmed with the panoply of energy drinks on the shelves. There is clearly money to be made here, so every company under the sun has their own brand, replete with flashy packaging and a mad-scientist assortment of ingredients. No Fear Super Energy Supplement drink is just such a drink. The cool black can with the menacing skull and bold lettering are alluring, likely to attract many. Tread cautiously, dear energy drink consumers.<br /><br />The aforementioned flashy labeling atop the can highlights ingredients such as Taurine, Arginine and L-Carnitine, which are all great components of a good energy drink, but the quantity included in this beverage are so minimal that their impact is likely negligible. And caffeine? 85mg per serving. Slightly higher than a cup of green tea. Basically, every ingredient falls far short of being able to have any real impact -- other than the sugar. But, I'll let the nutritional panel speak for itself:<br /><br />Serving Size: 8 fl oz (240ml)<br />Servings Per Container: 2<br /><br />Amount Per Serving:<br />Calories: 130<br />Total Carb.: 34g (11%)<br />Sugars: 33g<br />Vitamin C: 60mg (100%)<br />Vitamin B6: 2mg (100%)<br />Folic Acid: 40mcg (10%)<br />Vitamin B12: 6mcg (100%)<br />Zinc: 1.5mcg (10%)<br />Selenium: 7mcg (10%)<br />Sodium: 100mg (4%)<br />Potassium: 20mg (1%)<br /><br />Proprietary Blend: 1.35g<br />Taurine: 1000mg<br />Innositol: 100mg<br />Caffeine: 87mg<br />Panex ginseng Root Extract: 50mg<br />Guarana (Paullinia Cupana) Seed Extract: 25mg<br />Grape Seed Extract: 25mg<br />L-Carnitine: 25mg<br />L-Arginine: 10mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Grape Juice Concentrate (Color), Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavor (Contains Soy), Inositol, Ascorbic Acid, Caffeine, Caramel Color, Fruit Juice Concentrate (Color), Monopotassium Phosphate, Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc Methionine Sulfate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Guarana (Paullina Cupana) Seed Extractive, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Potassium Sorbate, Selenium Complex with Amino Acids and Polypeptides, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin.<br /><br />Well, if that list isn't compelling enough to get you to rush out and slam a few of these, maybe the taste will! The flavor is something akin to a slightly un-ripened fruit blend, with a metallic, vitamin aftertaste. If you aren't yet drooling, then perhaps the energy rush will get your head swirling. Speaking of ... .<br /><br />For an ""energy supplement,"" there was nary a buzz derived from this beverage. I experienced an ever-so-slight perk, likely due to the sugar content, rather than the blend of B-Vitamins, amino acids and caffeine, which was quickly followed by a large crash, again, likely due to the sugar (66g in the entire can, may I remind you!).<br /><br />Bottom line:  No Fear Super Energy drink is essentially nothing more than colored sugar (well, high fructose corn syrup, specifically) water. You're honestly better off drinking a good old 12 ounce can of Mountain Dew, which has better flavor, a bigger energy boost, lower caloric impact and cheaper cost. Fear the No Fear."

The drink goes down hard like cough medicine did when you were a kid. Picture your first swig of booze. You were expecting one thing, and well, you remember, right?

Online you may get the general idea, which is open to interpretation.<br /><br />I've never had an energy drink before, or any energy product besides 5 hour energy.  With that, which I have only tried that once, was if I drank the whole bottle, tho it is small it may have given me energy, but I didn't feel very good, until it wore off.<br /><br />This product, No Fear, which I had to turn the can around to even see what it was called, it's a 16 ounce can, which is supposed to be 2 servings.  On the front of the can it says super energy supplement.<br /><br />I took a few sips.  It tastes like grapefruit, so the taste isn't bad.  It's kind of refreshing.<br /><br />Then I read the ingredients on the back of the can.  What I saw amazed me!!<br /><br />Calorie wise it's 130 calories, but what really surprised me is the amount of carbohydrates, it's 34 grams, but the sugar is 33 grams, and both of those are for ONE serving!<br /><br />I wonder if the real energy you are getting is because of all of the sugar that is in this product!<br /><br />The caffeine level is 87 mg's, so I don't know how much that computes to when you are considering the amount of caffeine, what differentiates a high caffeine level versus a low caffeine level.  I suspect that this drink is on the higher end of the spectrum as far as the caffeine level.<br /><br />I just wonder if the can shows it's for 2 servings, what if you don't want to drink the whole can at once, which is 16 ounces?  If you saved the other half of the can, just like soda, which first has fizz when you open the can, if you have some left over it won't have the fizz.<br /><br />Iam really not sure who would want to drink this product or why, but for me, just the amount of carbohydrates and sugars would make this a drink I could never consider drinking.<br /><br />At least for me, this is NOT a healthy drink!  Maybe if your main concern is having more energy it may not matter to you, but at what cost?<br /><br />I would be curious to see how someone would feel who had drank this whole can of No Fear.<br /><br />What they should fear is getting diabetes, especially if they drank this on a regular basis!"
75810,B004MO6NI8,AF3BYMPWKWO8F,2/27/12,1,1,2,Mostly High Fructose Corn Syrup,"No Fear Super Energy is mostly made up of high fructose corn syrup - it's the #2 item on the ingredient list after carbonated water.

Yes, there are some other ingredients which may increase your energy, but most of the energy will undoubtedly be due to the HFCS.<br /><br />Each can is said to contain 2 servings, but since it's a carbonated beverage, it's not really going to keep well.

75853,B004MO6NI8,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,4/21/12,0,0,2,Not the best taste and left me jittery,"Over the years I've probably tried almost every energy drink (and energy shot) out there at least once, from Monster to Venom to Rockstar to the ubiquitous Red Bull along with a bevy of ""natural"" energy drinks (FRS, Genesis Pure, etc.). This No Fear drink looks a lot more ""hardcore"" than the other ones, with a mostly black can dominated by a winged skull. On the inside, though the ingredients are mostly the same. The flavor is also similar - slightly fruity with a hint of carbonation and an aftertaste of vitamins. But I have to say this one falls pretty low on the taste scale for me. It also has a pretty powerful smell that I didn't care for. But taste alone doesn't kill an energy drink as long as it works. Unfortunately this one didn't give me energy as much as it just made me feel jittery and a little antsy. And 30 minutes after drinking it I got a headache. It's not the worst energy drink I've tried but it's definitely not one I look forward to trying again."

I was hoping for a flavor similar to Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, but this isn't even close and I've honestly produced better flavor just using sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in my latte. I appreciate other coffee shops' pumpkin lattes, so if this had tasted good, I could have gotten over the fact that it was different from Starbucks', but I just plain don't like it. I think the spice is too heavy--I'm not sure exactly what spices were used in creating this, but based on pumpkin dessert recipes I've made it seems like maybe there is too much allspice?

Also, the flavor was just weird. Not quite vanilla-like. There was a hint of nuttiness. Maybe hazel nut or maple syrup.<br /><br />After eating the Arctic Zero Vanilla Maple flavor, I realized that the base for the Cookies and Cream flavor are the SAME! All they did was add crushed cookies to it! And, that was where the nutty, hazelnut-like, maple syrup-like flavor was coming from!<br /><br />Pretty lame if you ask me!!!!"

After checking them out on Amazon and reading some good reviews, I headed to the local big-box natural grocery store to buy one of each of the flavors (they're slightly more than half the Amazon price there).  Even the cashier commented that she'd heard good things about this brand, and that the Cookies and Cream flavor seemed to be customers' favorite.<br /><br />After trying this flavor last night, however, I don't think I'll be buying these again.  As other reviewers have said, the color is different from a typical, off-the-shelf cookies and cream ice cream, although that doesn't bother me because I'm used to all-natural foods being different in color than their synthetic counterparts.  What did bother me, however, was the taste - I would NOT classify this as overly sweet as some other reviewers have. In fact I'd classify the flavor as slightly bland, with no cookie flavor whatsoever.  In fact, I checked the container to make sure I hadn't accidentally gotten the maple vanilla flavor out of the freezer, since I'd bought that flavor as well.  In addition, I felt that the texture was ""off"" somewhat - not grainy or anything, just more viscous than a normal ice cream (it seemed to ""coat"" my mouth for a long time after I ate it).<br /><br />All in all, I ended up eating about 3 teaspoons of this and putting it back in the freezer - great for portion control, but I'd rather spend my calories on ice cream that tastes good rather than eating something non-appetizing just because it's low in calories.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the other flavors of this product might appeal to me more than this one did!"

76350,B001HTKOWC,ADNA24AADKBQ9,5/10/09,12,13,2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6."
76361,B001HTKOWC,A2PVVYTGFPMM5H,10/15/10,0,1,2,Not great,"Very disappointed with the flavor, or lack therof.  Stash usually has dependable products, so this was a real letdown."

The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life, this is not a bad tea at all. If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do."
76424,B001HTKOWC,AOJA5NCVKK49Z,4/12/11,1,1,2,Hot water,"I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed."
76427,B001HTKOWC,A3O6FCBYGK8EZ9,2/9/11,1,1,2,I'll pass,"For some reason, I was just not able to fully enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I tried to brew it different ways starting with the water temperature and brewing length.<br /><br />At best this tea was just okay when lightly brewed and some might enjoy the subtle flavor this way.<br /><br />I thought most jasmine blossoms take time to develop but the longer I brewed this tea, the more bitter it became and tasted so strange I had to dump it on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Due the ratings for this tea being very high on amazon.com, I wanted to like this tea and tried my best to enjoy it.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch, but for now I'll pass on this tea.<br /><br />* * 2 / 5 * * * * *<br /><br />Ciao"

I have used those for years as both an alleviate and an ironic potpourri for would-be long-term guests, and I have never been disappointed. Imagine my dismay, then, when I received (by breathless messenger) this item, clearly intended to be *eaten*.  Shudder."
77007,B001OCKIP0,A1R5Q4GXSYSKPH,4/18/12,0,1,2,Disappointed,"When I saw all those chocolate chunks in Back To Natures Granola I got a little too excited.  I love me some chocolate and when it is in granola I can only imagine the orgasmic experience in my mouth.  I am sad to report that no orgasmic experience was to be had.  Upon first bite I noticed a great crunch but the flavor of the granola by itself almost had a raw taste to it, like a raw flour/oat taste and it was very off putting. Not at all sweet and that could be a plus for someone who is trying to not eat too much sugar but I need my granola to have some sort of sweetness to it which this granola did not have.  I had some of the chocolate in the mix and that by itself was very delicious but not worth the cost of the granola, will just get a chocolate bar.  I much prefer the Love Crunch Granola By Natures Path, that is absolutly scrumptious and has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor and pieces along with freeze dried berries, plus it is all organic.  So if you are looking for a nice flavorful granola that has nice chocolate goodness look elsewhere because you will not get that with this granola."
77017,B001OCKIP0,A3BAE79NXFDXGV,6/10/09,0,1,2,A so-so granola that'll please those who enjoy chocolate chips,"Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is an okay granola cereal.  But it didn't have anything that really struck a chord with me,  It's a rather ordinary granola with some chocolate chips thrown in.  Nothing less, nothing more.  On the plus side it wasn't stale and it has a fresh taste to it.  If you're a big granola connoisseur then you'll enjoy it,  The casual granola eater wont be so pleased."
77018,B001OCKIP0,A3JL8RSRRJRK0I,6/10/09,0,1,2,OK AS A CEREAL,"I enjoy granola and trail mix products, but I found this very hard to chew and hard on the teeth. About halfway through the bag I decided to use it as a cereal and it was good that way. I wouldnt buy it for that use though, too expensive. Very hard to chew dry!"
77046,B001OCKIP0,AY8RR5LJIYM8C,5/28/09,0,1,2,Generic,"I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I like granola, but I don't really get to eat it a lot, due the high carb nature of all granola.  I also like chocolate, ok I love chocolate.<br /><br />I thought this might be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />I first tried it in cold milk as cereal.  The granola is typical granola.  Lots of chewing, so so taste.  On top of that was the chocolate.  Something about the chocolate and the milk made the chocolate taste practically overwhelm the granola.  Not bad, just not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I next tried it as a dry snack.  Except for the mess of eating granola without a spoon and some milk to hold it in place, this was better.  The chocolate taste was a little more subtle, basically coming in the bites that had chocolate.  Plus with it being dark chocolate, it's not overwhelming.<br /><br />Back to Nature products are expensive.  That's what you get when you go with a small company who is actually producing less processed products.  This isnt' that important to me, but it could be important to you.<br /><br />As some others here have suggested, the idea is a good one.  Maybe having a bag of chocolate chips that you love mixed with a bag of granola that you love, and coming up with a good ratio would make for a wonderful snack (or even a wonderful breakfast) but to me this isn't it."
77047,B001OCKIP0,A3I2WE58OUUEXG,5/27/09,0,1,2,Not that great,"This granola is not near as good as many others I have tasted.  The chocolate leans toward bitter or there isn't enough sweetness or richness to the mix.  Something isn't quite right.  Oh, it's edible, of course, but with spendy granola, it needs to be really delicious before you fork over that kind of dough for the product.  It's just not worth the price."
77060,B001OCKIP0,A3IOCPLIMYDBCD,6/1/09,0,2,2,Maybe For an Occasional Snack,"The texture is good, the chocolate bits are good, but oh my goodness, this is so sweet.  It's way too sweet for me as luck would have it.  I expected sweet with the chocolate but wow!  Blech!<br /><br />And at 220 calories for a half cup, there's not much nutritional value.  It is filling, I'll give it that, and it has a significant amount of fiber.<br /><br />You might like this if you pour sugar in your cereal.  And it's OK for a snack, but I wouldn't eat this on a regular basis.  There are far too many tasty, healthy products around for me to eat this &lt;gag>."
77062,B001OCKIP0,A3HOGJ49XCSCW7,5/29/09,0,2,2,A Failure for Granola - Maybe a Win for Cereal?,"I wanted to like this product, but I didn't on so many levels.<br /><br />Since this was marketed as a snack, I expected to be able to reach into the bag and grab a cluster or two of delicious chocolately granola.  No.<br /><br />The top-most layer of the bag did indeed have clusters, but they didn't last long.  The bottom 80% of the bag was tiny pieces of granola and flakes of choclate... better suited for cereal than snacking.<br /><br />The clusters, when they were together, don't contain chocolate.  So even if you managed to get a few clustery snacks, it was just granola stuck together.  Tasteless granola.  The chocolate is there in little flakes, which were good, but unless you were scooping the stuff into your mouth you're not going to get any.<br /><br />I should probably have tried the product again as a cereal with milk, alas I was out of milk and rarely enjoy cereal anyway.<br /><br />Oh, and anyone tagging this as ""healthy"" has another thing coming.  Half a cup of the stuff is 220 calories.<br /><br />The only thing this product has going for it is the resealable packaging which was quite good."
77063,B001OCKIP0,A3T7V207KRDE2O,5/26/09,1,4,2,Never cared for granola still don't,"I wasn't sure what I was getting. I have never really cared much for granola so I thought I'd see what they would do with chocolate. It's just square bits of chocolate mixed with granola. The chocolate is nothing special and it's just plain old granola. You might as well buy bulk granola and a bag of chocolate. That way you can have granola however you want it: with milk, alone or with chocolate. And you can have the chocolate by itself as well."

It has a very thin slop-like texture, whole peas, and is a pale grayish brown color.  The only way they'll eat it is if I mix it with other food and even then, they turn their noses up at it most of the time.

While I think the ingredients are outstanding and I've read good things about this company (our dog eats the Canidine organic dry dog food..same company), we were disappointed because our cats won't eat it. We've now purchased three different formulas hoping we'd hit on one they like, but out of four cats, only one will eat the chicken formula. Our older three males just turn up their nose to all three formulas. So, it's back to pet guard for them."

They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.

My item was originally lost/delayed in the mail due to no fault of the seller's.  They were quick to respond to my concern, and sent another item to ensure that the sprinkles would make it in time for my daughter's birthday.  But here is my concern (and it is a big one!) - the sprinkles came in an unsealed, unlabeled jar that just had a slip of paper with the ingredients hastily scotch taped to the bottle.  I now see that this was also the case with another reviewer's item.  I will not be willing to use these sprinkles - even though they are exactly what I was expecting and wanted - because I have no idea where they came from or who has had contact with them!  I am not willing to give these to a group of toddlers and their parents.  So basically I paid for something that I will not be using.  And if I attempt to return them to the seller, will they just resell them to another person without knowing if I could have opened the item and touched them?  This is just nasty.  I am very disappointed, especially since it is too late to order something similar to this for my daughter's party."

If you don't like a very strong fruit juice, you may like this more than I did. I like my juice to give me a little more kick. So, I thought I would add vodka....a shot of Belvedere can fix just about anything. WRONG. Do not buy this juice as a drink mixer. I struggled with myself over forcing it down or pouring it down the drain. I drank most of it, because I love vodka, but I do not love black cherry Switch."

Everyone in my family tried it, and NO ONE liked it, although we usually like cherry flavors.  The only use I can think of this is to maybe put a bit in coke, as if it were a flavoring, and not a drink meant to be consumed on its own....if you like a cherry coke.  We didn't try that though.  In fact, we threw the majority of the one can we opened away.<br />The carbonation level was great though, and I like the shape of the cans, the fact it is 100% juice, and the amount in each serving is perfect."

I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda/juice.  I guess there is a market for that, I'm just not part of it."
77593,B001LG940E,A3C1QYGEET3BVY,3/10/09,0,0,2,not bad but not great either,This drink is basically lightly carbonated fruit juice. It has a strong berry flavor that's not bad although it's not good enough for me to actually seek out. I'll take a pass.

This time, while I can say that the Switch Black Cherry doesn't taste like mere apple juice (there is a tart, berry/cherry flavor), it is far, far too sweet. I took my first swallow out of the can and was just completely turned-off by just how sweet the beverage actually is. Served over ice and allowed to sit for a minute made it a good bit more tolerable, but when I grab something to drink, I want to drink it right then, not 5 minutes or so later. It doesn't taste bad, mind you, it's just way too sweet, almost overpoweringly so. A quick glance at the can says it all...33 grams of sugar...6 more than the same serving size of Coca-Cola. Needless to say, if you're looking for a healthy alternative to soda, this isn't the place to look (especially since there's really very little nutritional value to be found here).<br /><br />I just don't see what the market for this is. Are people crying out for carbonated juice beverages? Is this being aimed at the energy drink crowd (same 8.3 ounce size as Red Bull after all)? Does anyone actually think this is much better for you than a Coke? It's not bad, but I wouldn't pay for it, and I sure don't see much of a market for it. Maybe if they add some caffeine to the mix..."

Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Acerola, and Cherry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). I was surprised to see Cherry as the last listed juice concentrate. Each can has 130 calories, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbohydrates, 33g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C. This sparkling juice tasted good as you drank it, has an identifiable taste of cherry, but it has a very unpleasant after taste. This after taste is enough for me to not want to try this again.

I think it is something that a kid would like.  The cherry taste is more of a juice mixture taste, not a pure cherry flavor.  The good news is that this drink has no artificial sweeteners or added sugar.  A healthy alternative for those who would like a soda/carbonated beverage.  I would prefer soda water with lemon or lime over this drink."

However, the drink was not the really the dream combination I would have guessed.  I appreciate that it's all natural, 100% juice, with all your day's vitamin C---lots of good reasons to drink it.  However, the taste is not one, for me anyway.  It tasted like a very sweet juice, not really a heavy cherry flavor, sort of just a general red juice type flavor you can get by sipping juice boxes!  The carbonation was very light, almost not noticable.  The can is SMALL, 8.3oz, and I can't imagine it really being enough for most adults to totally quench their thirst.  For almost a dollar a can, you would expect more---in terms of gourmet type taste, amount of product and in general, something more special!"
77673,B001LG940E,A2UYWE97KME0M,3/19/09,1,2,2,Cherry - Really?,I was expecting a cross between soda and juice with this.  Turns out that it tastes just like apple juice.  There is no soda fizz and there isn't really any cherry flavor.  It isn't bad tasting ... but isn't anything special and I wouldn't buy it in mass.
77675,B001LG940E,A2ZE5ICI6LWAZ0,3/8/09,1,2,2,Too sweet for me,"For a product that has no added sweeteners, this drink is very sweet. It has a strong cherry and something-other-than-cherry flavor, and just enough carbonation to remind you of soda. The 8.3oz serving size was definitely enough for me because I found it cloyingly sweet. The color was the natural color of cherry juice mixed with water or seltzer, so I didn't find that surprising.<br /><br />If you enjoy very sweet drinks, this is definitely for you. It was way too sweet for me, and I didn't like the something-other-than-cherry flavor. It made it taste ""off"" to me."

If I wanted to drink fruit juice, I would drink fruit juice. Both have their own merits and qualities. This product just seems to fall ""flat"" when compared to either soda or juice.<br /><br />The high amount of carbohydrates and ridiculous amount of sugar makes it just as bad as soda or fruit juice, from the standpoint of raising one's blood sugar levels and causing obesity. Diabetics will want to avoid it altogether. How much protein does it contain? Zero.<br /><br />As has been noted by other reviewers, the carbonation is definitely much less than with most sodas, which gives it a bit of a ""flat"" taste. Speaking of taste, it didn't really taste much at all like black cherry. Take one look at the ingredient list, and you'll see why. It's mostly apple and grape juice, which is MUCH cheaper for the company to buy than using real, black cherry flavoring, which there is barely a hint of.<br /><br />Those of you thinking that there is enough real juice in this beverage to give the listed 100% RDA of Vitamin C are in for a surprise. The only reason that this beverage is able to make the 100% RDA claim is because it separately adds ascorbic acid as an ingredient. In other words, they sprinkle in some powdered Vitamin C in order to make it healthier. If you drank an 8 ounce glass of water, along with a Vitamin C tablet, you would get the same amount of nutrition, while avoiding the extra calories and sugar.<br /><br />The taste is just ""o.k."", at best. Altogether, it isn't necessarily ""bad"" for you, but there are certainly much healthier things for one to drink. What I really find difficult to understand it why this product is so darned expensive. If you're going to spend that much money, you might as well just buy real fruit juice. I wouldn't buy this product unless it was at least 75% less expensive than it is now."

I suppose if you need to ingest 130 KCal at a throw, and don't want to drink a beer, then this will do the trick. However, I can't say as I care for it and if I want cherries, I'll buy the fruit and eat that."

The cherry flavor is pretty good if you like the taste of marachino cherry juice (you know: like drinking the juice out of a jar of marachino cherries) I would only buy this if it were DRASTICALLY reduced in price and then use it as a flavoring in other drinks or recipies where some marachino cherry juice and carbonation might add something."

I'd use that one as a mixer, but probably not drink on its own.<br /><br />As for the cherry flavor - don't like it. I'll admit that I usually don't like cherry flavored things, but black cherry (like this drink) is usually OK. I also like cherry soda, so I figured this would be ok.<br /><br />Well, unlike Chery Coke or something similar, this is JUST the cherry flavor (duh to me) and not the coke, so I don't like it. Too cherry for me. I also gave it to my husband to try - he is a soda drinker and does like cherry. He said he didn't think it was carbonated enough. He was also confused if it was supposed to be an energy drink or not, probably because of the small can size. He said for en energy drink not bad, but for a soda not great (funny how energy drinks get a free pas on tasting bad).Neither of us finished it.<br /><br />So conclusion - if you really like cherry flavor, you'll probably like it. If you don't, you won't."
77737,B001LG940E,A688RIZ2POWSQ,3/5/09,0,1,2,don't get this flavor,"Unless you like medicine, because, that's what it tasted like. I like most things and I love flavored drinks but this flavor didn't do it for me.  It reminded me of medicine I took as a child or cough medicine they have now over the counter.  As far as the product though, I like it.  The can said that it's juice and carbonated water, and I can believe that.  Get the other flavor though."
77738,B001LG940E,A3CHMHGSJSQ02J,3/5/09,0,1,2,I know it's not a soda,"But it could really use some more carbonation. A bit more fizz might take the overpoweringly cloying taste down a notch, and make it more palatable. As it stands, it's far too sweet and leaves a strong syrupy aftertaste that burns your throat and makes you thirsty. It's a very small can, but I could barely get through half of it before I was reaching for the water. On the plus side, it does actually taste of black cherry."
77756,B001LG940E,A1BEKAQQGP8CMF,3/4/09,0,1,2,"An OK flavor, but not as great as I expected","Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />Prior to trying this, I enjoyed both the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">kiwi berry</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">watermelon strawberry</a> flavors. Those were good on their own and decent with a pastry, but black cherry is a different case. First of all, it smells like grape, perhaps white grape. Secondly, it tastes like a flat cherry soda or a carbonated cough medicine. And honestly, I taste a hint tomato soup in there. Try it for yourself! It's an OK flavor, but not as great as I expected. But the can is cool - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling."

(But not in a good way.)<br /><br />When the package arrived I happened to be very thirsty, so I opened it right up and drank it without chilling.<br /><br />It tasted pretty good until the after taste hit me.  For a drink that advertises to be 100% juice it has more of an artificial after taste then I think it should have.  The taste reminds me of children's chewable vitamins.<br /><br />In general I would suggest mixing up your own version of this by combining juice or juice syrup with soda water.  Not as convenient, but probably more refreshing."

The overriding flavor in this drink is apple juice.  If I concentrated hard enough, I could (almost) detect a faint taste of cherries; I won't buy something if I have to concentrate to detect the flavoor I want to taste.<br /><br />If you like apple juice more than cherries, this soft drink would be perfect for you.  It's got plenty of carbonation, and it has no added sugar or artificial sweeteners (which is why I gave it two stars).  Even without the sugar, it's plenty sweet (without being too sweet).  If you want a flavor other than apple, try the tangerine.  Of the three flavors I've tried, tangerine is the only one to actually taste like it's supposed to."

Black Cherries are not favorite fruit; however I tried this drink but did not make any positive impression on me. The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors.

Unfortunately, I count calories, and I don't want 130 calories for something that tastes like a slightly fizzy apple juice drink. The flavor was supposed to be black cherry, but it tasted strongly of apple juice which makes sense since it's one of its main ingredients.<br /><br />I simply don't see myself ""switch""-ing to this drink rather than my diet black cherry (or diet cherry cola) soda. If I want to drink a vitamin drink, then I turn to Emergen-C which is much lower in calories and packs a huge vitamin wallop. It also adds a carbonated feel to juice products when I choose one of those. So, unlike the advertising, I did not find Switch to be ""the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION."""

With my first taste, it was diffidently real juice and it went down very smooth. It was not until I started tasting the effects of that wine-cooler after taste that my taste buds started to dislike it. Within a few seconds of my first drink, I could sense the taste of a fermented beer like taste. Because I am not much of a wine drinker, nor do I like the taste of beer that has had a chance to sit idol for some time, I believe I will pass on further purchases of anymore ""The Switch"" drinks. It just doesn't fit the taste of what I'm after in a soft drink replacement.<br />I give the Black Cherry flavor a 2 star for its true black cherry flavor, but the stale beer taste forbids any score higher than that."

Cherry flavored juice with added carbonation.  I admit I was curious to see what 100% carbonated juice would taste like as opposed to something like a lemon-lime soda that contains almost all water and almost no juice.  My first impression is that they made a good decision in keeping the carbonation lighter than the average soda (still enough for a belch or two).  My second impression is 100% juice just doesn't taste good carbonated.  I think I would have preferred the juice just by itself.  Finally, at approximately one dollar per can I would most likely skip this for a sixteen ounce bottle of juice at roughly the same price if I were in the grocery aisle."

Unfortunately, that was not the case.  First of all, the portion size is diminuative in comparison to drinking a canned soda. I did not find the taste to be very appealing. It just didn't taste like black cherry to me, at all. It had a harsh flavor with a strong aftertaste and the carbonation was very mild - almost tasted flat. As other reviewers have pointed out, too, it is relatively high in caloric content even without adding additional sugar.  It is great that it contains a full days supply of Vitamin C but, for me anyway, that does not justify the cost of the product or the weird taste."
77831,B001LG940E,ANEDXRFDZDL18,2/24/09,1,1,2,Okay not great,"Switch Black Cherry soda had sort of a strange aftertaste to me. Perhaps it was because the soda is sweetened with fruit rather than sugar, or perhaps it was what I ate for lunch, but the flavor didn't excite me.<br /><br />I would say this is a pretty average tasting drink. I'm not a big fan of carbonated drinks as they are pretty harsh on your stomach, so I'd shy away from recommending this one."

I haven't been drinking it much lately for reasons of health, so the thought of a healthier replacement is always a good thing.<br />Well what we have here is pretty much what one expects from a carbonated juice, as that's what it is. It certainly doesn't taste anything like normal black cherry soda, a favorite flavor. If anything, it tastes more like sparkling grape juice -- but seriously, almost $1 for an 8.3oz can, in a 24 pack? It's just not worth it.<br />I can see this working as a great substitute for soda for kids, but otherwise I don't see this particularly worth the purchase."

It has no sugar added or corn syrup, no artificial colors or preservatives--these are all positive attributes.<br /><br />I think the concept of combining fruit juice and carbonation in a small-shot serving (8.3 ounces in a slim can) is just fine.  My problem with Black Cherry Switch in particular (the only flavor I have tried) is that cherry juice is listed fourth out of four juices this beverage contains (the other three are apple, grape and acerola juices).  As a result, the cherry flavor ends up battling (and getting trounced by) these other flavors.  The end result was, for me, inadequate cherry flavor.<br /><br />Will I run out to buy more Black Cherry Switch?  No.  Even though the beverage was refreshing, the cherry flavor was too muddled by other juices and too low in the ingredients list to give me the punch of black cherry flavor that I expected and wanted.<br /><br />Would I buy more Black Cherry Switch if it had a more distinct cherry taste?  Yes, it is highly likely that I would buy it at least occasionally."

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.

Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed.

The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.

I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter.  And it wasn't something that was subtle, I actually cringed a little bit on my first tasting.  I will look elsewhere for my next bottle of olive oil."

The flavor starts a bit grassy, but then a flat, mouth-puckering astringency takes over. At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same.  I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities.  I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California, Europe, and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil.  Given the number of good reviews out there, I hope I just got a bad batch."

Although the aroma is very nice, fresh and green smelling, there is a distinct bitterness in the flavor. This is not the peppery finish you find in good olive oil. I like the peppery finish.

I recommend that you try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET63MK"">Barbera Frantoia Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 33.8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a> instead.

Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me.

79069,B001EPPIT8,A30NSORN632DDH,6/13/12,0,0,2,Oh the salt level,"I expect salt in a salmon jerky, but this is fully twice the salt level as a similar item I also purchased. Worse, it permiated the flavor. It was like salmon jerky texture with salmon-salt flavor.  The package is 1.25 oz and in what seems stilly, claim 1.25 servings. Gee thanks. So of course we will eat the whole thing and the 38% of salt for a day is really about 46%.  I might as well eat Campbell soup if I wanted salt poisoning at that level - it'd be a lot cheaper.<br /><br />I did find one bone. I would not count that as a problem.  I did not like that the pieces were chopped into fairly small chips."
79070,B001EPPIT8,A2MOOK3JHP715R,2/27/12,0,0,2,Way too salty,"This salmon jerky has the right texture, the right moisture and the right chewiness to be the perfect salmon jerky.<br /><br />Sadly, they completely messed it up by oversalting it, and then throwing more salt on it.  After eating a few packs in the evening, I actually woke up from thirst in the middle of the night and had to drink water.  Twice !<br /><br />I wouldn't feed this to my dog."
79112,B000LKYNLG,A2DMK3REP7LEGI,11/28/07,0,1,2,Not So Tasty,"Out of the several brands of canned refried beans I have tried, this is my least favorite.  They become more palatable if one adds granulated garlic and finely diced onions."
79120,B007JTTMB8,A37K8O1Q3D20VD,3/27/11,2,2,2,Dog won't bite!,"I bought a small pack of these in my quest to see if our dog (A Sheltie-terrier mix), would chew some dog-breath product.  No such luck.  If you are not sure about your own dog cough up the expensive shipping for a small pack, like I did, before ordering tens of dollars worth!"
79159,B002P6FSVS,A334QC7ZCO4NCF,1/18/12,0,2,2,Whoa! HOW MUCH!?,"I figured you could rip off the typical Anime freak/nerd/whatever but this is just dumb. These sodas cost a buck in Japan. ONE BUCK. And you'll selling it for FOUR!? This stuff is delicious, melon is my favourite, and these sodas aren't as sweet and full of unnecessary ingredients as American sodas are. Just five ingredients: carbonated water, sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, citric acid, and the artificial flavour of the product you're buying. That's it! Cute little 6.6 fl oz to boost (or you can buy the larger ones for like three bucks) and the marble is a cool effect, just a little confusing on how to open the bottle at first, especially if you're craving soda. This stuff is worth buying.........but not here. This is a total rip-off. Unless you're adamant about Amazong and willing to stay at home and pay for shipping and handling, and the greedy price for cheap soda, have at it. It's your money. Your call. I'm not the government telling you how you should spend your money. ........I just highly recommend you go somewhere else for your Ramune. Like Japan. Or a Japanese store. Not here."
79185,B002WDCIXK,A336LGWA4H3V4H,1/12/12,1,1,2,Way too expensive,"Like the product, but come on....  $38.00 for a little creamer in a cup.  The old fashion way works for me just fine."
79256,B003TNANSO,A2UWJDLBDI1B7J,11/12/10,1,1,2,"Too sticky, messy","The bar is a sticky mess inside a wrapper that can't be pulled away from the ""bar"".  The flavor is good, but much of the contents remain stuck to the wrapper.  If you do manage to pull the wrapping away, the contents sag and fall apart.  I have had other Kind bars and liked them, but will not buy this variety again."
79260,B003TNANSO,AOPP88O22LSB6,10/31/10,1,1,2,Not my kind of flavor,"I've only eaten the KIND bar once, and it was definitely not this flavor but I didn't realize it until I opened it up and tasted it.  I love mango. I love macadamia. But in this bar, together, they are not great.  It's not bad... just not my cup of tea. The mango is a little too artificial and I don't get the macadamia crunch so I would say try another flavor."
79274,B003TNANSO,AAJSIP9A8OY5Y,12/27/11,3,4,2,Not up to kind bar standards,I saw this kind bar on amazon and bought it to try. I had high expectations that were dashed the minute I tasted the first bite. The mixture of the mango and macadamia do not go well together. I was very disappointed.
79275,B003TNANSO,A17V2N0N8CXSA9,11/3/11,3,4,2,Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants,"First got turned onto these bars at Starbucks. Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason. So I ordered the  Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants as well as another type, figuring that even if the kids did not like it my husband would take the remainders to work to snack on midday. Well no one likes this flavor. It consists of a lot of the puffed filler grains used in cheap bars, almost like smaller firmer rice crispies. I even had the box in the car to pull out when the kids were starving as a snack but no go and husband doesn't like them. The other kind I ordered was the fruit and nut delight which everyone will eat, but our favorite remains the blueberry vanilla and cashews."
79276,B003TNANSO,A1648PNP0S8G07,1/25/11,3,4,2,Too Sweet,"I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product). Every bar is 40g and there are 13g of sugar. Yikes. I wish I had looked this up before I purchased this because I have nine more bars. What's worse, instead of getting twelve bars, my box only came with ten. I will not be ordering this or any other Kind bars."
79281,B003TNANSO,A3RUMVZZ7W2E2S,10/9/10,2,3,2,Definitely not for me...,"I have enjoyed the KIND bars, but these Almond Cashew ones are definitely not for me.  Much more dense and gooey that the other varieties that I have had, they did have a good crunch.  However, even the crunch felt slightly mushy at times.  With no real flavor to make up for the texture, I would not buy these again."
79304,B003TNANSO,A3GSZWOVHBAZ4O,8/16/10,123,139,2,Changed Formula,"These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.  We found out that the company has moved to a new factory/producer and that the formula has changed in some ways.  The flavor is not as fresh and tastes more like processed food. We are really disappointed and are hoping that the company can somehow find its way back to making really great bars."
79331,B003TNANSO,A2TT6MP6XH1KSX,8/28/12,0,0,2,Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate Bars,Have they changed the recipe? These aren't as good as they used to be.<br />I had them about 6 months ago and they just aren't as tasty.
79333,B003TNANSO,A2HW8VV8EHYKN4,8/22/12,0,0,2,My least favorite,"I bought several of the Kind bar flavors and these were the worst of the bunch. My son LOVES mango and macadamia, but this combination in the bar fell short of our expectations. So many other great flavors to try, I would not recommend these unless you do not care about the taste! Bleh."
79418,B003TNANSO,A1ED419H25YY7,8/26/10,4,4,2,better to buy local,Unfortunately these bars taste rather stale and old...nuts do not keep forever...and I get the sense that these have been held somewhere for far too long.  Better to buy from your local store where you have some idea of the turnover..and can easily complain should the same problem arise.
79446,B003TNANSO,APVZCLLIB9DO2,10/19/10,0,0,2,Product Arrived in Poor Condition,"These bars taste fine but there is a problem with the condition of the product sent. The back of the bars are stuck (perhaps melted?) to the plastic wrapper and can only be removed by scraping off small, individual pieces. I ordered these Cranberry Almond bars along with the Kind Apricot Almond and Mango Macadamia Nut bars.  The other flavors came from a different seller and arrived in great condition, even though they were sent in the same shipment as the defective box.  I won't bother with the hassle of attempting to return them, especially since I ate one of the bars before I realized there was a problem with the entire box.  A real waste of money."
79479,B003TNANSO,A1U9SYJN9KH8FB,1/20/12,1,2,2,The bars were stale even though it pas not past the expiration date,I had one of these bars at starbucks and really liked it soI ordered them from Amazon. The bars tasted stale . I checked the expiration date thinking that these might have expired. I found that they have not expired. Not sure whether I can return them since I already had a bar...Very disappointed with this purchase
79483,B003TNANSO,A1S3DVQDJRRFEG,2/14/11,1,2,2,I won't order this one again,I'm a HUGE fan of Kind bars in general and have tried several varieties. I chose the almond cashew with flax + Omega-3 this time because it was more price friendly than the others. I should have known that you get what you pay for. This was the most unsatisfying Kind bar I've ever had. It's dry and lacks taste. Now I'm stuck with a whole box.
79484,B003TNANSO,A1P51R2I1JDI5J,2/7/11,1,2,2,Too bland,"I ordered this item, hoping that the combination of nuts would be good, but I was sadly disappointed with the taste.  Its like they tried to use as little sweetener as possible, leaving a dry, dull, bland taste and its like I could have just bought a bag of mixed nuts for cheaper than what I paid for this box of bars.<br /><br />Would not buy again."
79498,B003TNANSO,A385E4RHJS3T57,12/6/10,0,1,2,Weird taste,"Definitely not my favorite.  I love KIND bars, but this variety has a strange after taste.  Would not recommend."

Of course you can't find that info here on Amazon, gotta go poke around the Kind website, and after a while, there it is. So, beware!"
79506,B003TNANSO,A1CDHEZSJU8RM7,7/26/11,2,5,2,All I taste is nougat and peanuts.,"The taste of nougat and peanuts is overwhelming in this bar.  If you would like a ""healthier"" version of a Baby Ruth candy bar, this is it."

I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]"
79514,B003TNANSO,AC9NHBI16OSZ3,7/30/11,1,5,2,High Glycemic,"If you've got sensitive blood sugar, DO NOT eat Kind bars. They are certainly not Kind. I crashed on them a few times before I realized their ""glycemic index"" numbers were false and misleading. They pump a lot of sugar into these bars and then juke the numbers. The best alternative is Mrs. Mays Trio Bars. I've been eating them for the last two years and never crashed.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFPW6I"">Mrs. May's  Trio Bar Variety Pack, 1.2-Ounce bars (Pack of 20)</a>"
79516,B003TNANSO,AA9DOZJQJ7393,12/17/11,2,13,2,Why would anyone buy these?,"I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing."
79531,B003TNANSO,A3QEJW1XWMHR98,5/25/11,3,3,2,Damp & chewy,"I purchase Kind bars from my retailer every day and was trying to save a few dollars. These bars arrived in a damaged carton that appeared to have experienced excessive moisture. The bars had a weird ""melted"" texture and were not up to standard. I would absolutely not reorder them from this source."
79540,B003TNANSO,A3G67803TWOB6D,3/19/12,2,2,2,New and NOT Improved,"I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste ""off"" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :("
79572,B003TNANSO,A2E4ROH3UVXCEJ,6/24/12,1,1,2,Good but maybe my package was old.,I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.
79573,B003TNANSO,A2ZTFDUDNBQ2Z7,6/23/12,1,1,2,"Taste great, but way overpriced for the size and ingredients.","I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value."
79628,B003YT18B4,A2I5LRBZ02LSEC,10/13/11,4,5,2,Not Bad,I've been drinking loose leaf tea for several years now and I appreciate the variety of this sampler but this is not high quality tea. Many of the teas have the same underlying smokey taste when they shouldn't.  It will do in a pinch but I don't think experienced tea drinkers will be pleased.  I moved from a large city to a rural area so I decided to try a different product since I no longer have access to the quality loose leaf tea a large city offers. I will not purchase again.

I love molasses but for some reason I just can't stomach this.

I ordered the 1 pound bag on auto-delivery but I must say I'm dissapointed because about one third of the bag was crumbs. The pieces are so broken, I cannot eat them as chips as intended. I waited until I opened the second bag before writing this review but I'm really dissapointed at the amount of crumbs/really small broken pieces that were in the packaging in the second bag as well. When I buy them in the store, almost the entire bag are large chips. I have discontinued my auto delivery. I guess I'll just continue to get them at the store. What a let down."

It has a subtle quality about it that sets is apart from the grounds found in tea bags. This tea does not have that quality. Rather than whole leaves, the tea is ground-up bits like in English breakfast tea. Even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks. Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer! If you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable, but why bother when you can do better with a bag? I won't be buying this again."

On par with how we season our own.<br />They're crisp.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Seeds are pretty small which means the ratio between seed and shell is not great.<br />Small seeds means you almost can't shell them, you HAVE to eat the shells.<br />Too many seeds have a sour taste which ruins the hole experience.<br />Per ounce they're more expensive than any others I've tried.<br /><br />I wish David's Seeds put out a lighter sea salt version. Their seeds are much larger so you can peel the shells if you want. They just have too much salt. I remember eating the Indian brand when I was a kid.

I bought this product as well and was worried that I would have the same problem as you described until I realized that it had an expiry date as well as a production date. The production date was dated as ""something/something 2011.""

I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed."

Put a little body to the chocolate and you will have a true winner!"

If you don't have sensitive taste buds it's great, but if you do.. stick with the Green Mountain Hot Chocolate."

I have a machine that lets you pick what size cup you want, small or medium and even on the small the hot chocolate is watery."

This cocoa was my first purchase.  It was so terrible I almost brought it back.  First, it took half the box to get the plastic taste out of the drink. A Keurig issue.  That last half of the box didn't redeem itself.  This cocoa tastes like flavored water, flavored with diet sugar.  It has the same aftertaste you would get with a diet soda or a sugar-free yogurt.  Also, you can't get more than 8 oz per cup. If you do, the taste just gets more watered down. A huge disappointment.  I will be trying other brands but my expectations are very low based on this first experience.<br /><br />I read a few reviews and learned that this product contains sucralose.  It is not listed as an ingredient.  Explains the diet taste plus I don't trust manufacturers who pull stunts like this.  The manufacturer is Green Mountain Coffee - very disappointing."

It is one of those things that has a ""something is wrong but I'm not exactly sure what"" kind of taste.  In some ways the flavor is like chocolate water.  In others it is more like carob. It just tastes fake.  I will not ever purchase this brand again."

I got it because my kids love hot chocolate, and usually they use my keurig just for hot water to mix their own hot chocolate. They were so excited to get this, but they didn't even drink their first cup of it because it has almost no chocolate flavor. I had to mix chocolate syrup in with it to give it any kind of flavor at all."
80278,B004342XH2,A3N50KD48HKCLW,11/15/11,0,0,2,DOES NOT TASTE LIKE MILK CHOCOLATE,I made 6 oz cup of this and it tasted awful.  It lacked milk chocolate flavor and was very watered down.  I was very disappointed because hot cocoa was the main beverage I wanted to brew since I do not drink coffee.  This was very bad.

However, the entire case was ruined, not one piece was not damaged, obviously they had melted either prior or during shipping. The chocolate was stuck to the top of the paper they are wrapped in. . They were still edible, but didn't quite taste the same, the chocolate was gooey instead of solid, even days later when stored at room temperature. They really disappointed me :( So I am hoping the next case I purchase will be fresh, as I am ordering in October a cooler month, and hoping it was ruined in delivery and not the sellers storage."

When I opened the shipping carton My wife and I noticed the original Splenda box was not properly sealed. The Splenda box was literally unsealed and open. It made us leary to think that someone might have tampered with the shipment. As of today no harm has come. The sugar is the same. The quantity is wonderful. The price well I've seen it for less.

Now, almost 2 years later, my dog has developed really bad cough allergy. I have solidly confirmed the food is the root cause by stopping & trying it again. I just want to mention that this is a 2nd time we have to discontinue dog food after years of use, due to newly developed allergies."

There was about a 4 pound clump of dog food that was so hard and compressed, it would have been unreasonable to break apart or use.  a 5 pound bag of this dog food goes for $13, so  I feel like I lost money on this purchase for the convenience of having it delivered instead of an in-store pickup.  I won't be purchasing dog food from Amazon again.  I don't feel as if they rotate the food out as well as it would if one were to purchase it from Petco or PetSmart."

Further, I am a pescatarian and was disappointed to see how almost every dry dog and cat food brand at the grocery stores and on the market contain chicken, lamb, or beef bi -products.  I love my dogs, but I cannot see feeding baby lamb to my dog! Even the ""only fish"" labelled dog and cat foods on the market often contain chicken, etc when you look on the ingredients list.  So I was very pleased to find a cost effective solution to this in natural balance.  The only issue is that my dogs will not touch this food! They would rather starve than eat it it seems, perhaps because it is the diet formula?  I'm not sure.  However, I will say that they all (including the cat) flock to the Natural Balance salmon dry cat food lol so I will continue ordering that for the cat."

80407,B0019955O2,A1MU235UTCDM31,9/22/09,1,1,2,Hard to find excellent decaf beans on Amazon.,"TLDR version:  Look elsewhere if you want great decaf beans.  These weren't even worth the price at 57% off list.<br /><br />Normal version:<br /><br />I purchased these when there was a deal a few weeks ago, and have been brewing both espresso and drip coffee with them and a caffeinated variety by the same company.  This review is for the Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Decaf Espresso.<br /><br />The first thing to say about Larry's Beans is that they are all packaged quite well in individual boxes which contain the air-tight bag of beans.  This makes them easy to stack in a warehouse, and also prevents warehouse employees from inadvertently slicing open the bag when unloading a crate or larger package.<br /><br />When I received the beans, I immediately fished out some freezer bags and prepared to portion out the beans.  I opened the sealed bag and the beans smelled OK; the smell wasn't overpowering but it was not what I would consider ""gourmet.""  It's not old or musty smelling like some of the other ""gourmet"" decaf bean roasters represented here on Amazon, but it's also not top shelf.<br /><br />Although the beans are evenly roasted, I would definitely not call it Espresso roast.  The roast is more reminiscent of a mild breakfast roast - medium brown, not the dark black I expect when I think of espresso.  Also, the beans are very small - clearly not a premium batch of beans.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to accurately represent the style of roast, and for the beans to be large, although uniform in size.  Neither were the case with these beans.<br /><br />When portioning the beans into 1lb freezer bags, I found that the beans really aren't oily at all.  I surmise that this has to be due to the water process used to decaffeinate the beans, although I don't know this to be a fact.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to be oily enough to leave a clear film on the inside of the freezer bags I package them in, and this didn't accomplish that feat.<br /><br />As you can see, the initial impressions of the look and smell of the beans were only mediocre, not outstanding like the price should suggest.  Now, on to the flavor.<br /><br />Fresh out of the 5lb bag, I hand-ground enough of the beans for a couple of shots of espresso.  Yes, I have a counter-mounted hand grinder that can also be used to make flour from grains!  Anyway, I ran the ground coffee through my pump espresso maker, and what came out the other side had no crema, although the shots themselves didn't taste horrible.  The flavor was reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, with astringent, grapeskin-like qualities that struck me as quite bitter for the mild roast.<br /><br />I have since made pots of drip decaf with this bean, and combined it with a caffeinated version from Larry's Beans, and it's passable (carried by the excellent quality of the caffeinated beans, I'm sure), although still not what I would consider worth the price.  I haven't found any excellent decaf beans on Amazon, yet, so I will move on to another variety once this batch is gone."

It has a certain novelty to it, but mostly it's just odd. I am sorry if my rating seems undeserved by people who like this candy. It's not that I don't appreciate old-fashioned candy. Some of it is great. But some of it went out of style for a reason."

Both cats wouldn't touch it at all - surprised me because one in particular is a turkey junky.  Can't figure this one out - it smells nice in the can, not strange odors that I can detect anyway.  It's pretty expensive to just toss but well, that's what I had to do.  It is healthy for your cat and it is a pate, not chunks.  However, that said, they don't care for the chunky Fancy Feast turkey variety either.  Not sure why - they gobble up the Friskies turkey and cheese like there's no tomorrow.  Not sure what to recommend here but to try it and see if your cat likes it.  Maybe it's just too boring! :)"

If you get it you'll know what I mean. None of the other Sour Power belts have this taste, it literally tastes like plastic and watermelon perfume compressed themselves into a belt and rolled in Sour Power powder.<br /><br />I love Sour Power as much as everyone, but next time I buy a HUGE tub (probably quite soon), it'll be of any other flavor."

In theory, they are.<br /><br />We originally started with another brand's organic rice cereal. It listed only a few ingredients: Rice, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopherols (Vitamin E), alpha-Amylase (Enzyme), Electrolytic Iron. Gerber's DHA/Probiotic rice cereal has a very long ingredient list, I think because of all of the vitamins it is fortified with. Well, that is fine. Wish it were more basic, but ok.<br /><br />My son loves ""normal"" rice cereal. With this DHA rice cereal, he will tolerate it, but he definitely noticed the difference. He kind of scrunches up his face. Today his made a gagging face and acted like he was going to throw it up. I don't know if that is because he doesn't like the weird flavor or what.  I tasted it too, and I can't stand the fishy sense I get when I eat it. It isn't a strong or overpowering fishy flavor, but there is definitely a weird aftertaste going on. You can still notice it when you mix in fruit or sweet potatoes to try and cover it up.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish the can we started. Back to the other brand for us. Bummer, Gerber.

Your initial answer will likely be 140 calories as that is what is printed on the bag of ""about 1"" servings.  In actuality, the bag is 1 3/8 oz or 1.375 oz.  So, there is over 190 calories in a bag which is more that 1/3 more calories than what you observe via a fast look at the nutritional info on the bag.  I consider this devious at the very least.

Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake ""cheez"" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs.

Don't expect that!<br /><br />With that said, they weren't that bad.  NOT sweet (unfortunately), and taste kinda fibery.  Pretty regular dry healthy crackers.  They are not filling, unless you tend to be filled up by index-card sizes of crispy dry whole wheat bread.  But they may help curb your appetite for a short while?<br />I enjoyed them of cheese and honey on top :-) Yummy.<br /><br />Summary:<br />- cracker= 2plain layers with very little fruit/seed bits in between<br />- feels healthy<br />- tastes okay."

81750,B005CUU25G,A2L35P0VQE7LBN,10/3/11,1,2,2,"Roller Jams, Wasted Product","The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."

81756,B005CUU25G,A351GW55IKKNHU,9/28/11,1,2,2,"Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie","The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that."

Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently."
81771,B005CUU25G,A3C9Q3KTNNLJJ,6/10/12,0,1,2,Not so great says my dog,"This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways."
81773,B005CUU25G,A20ZMC10HTZ4ZW,10/19/11,0,1,2,Our dog's opinions,"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary."
81774,B005CUU25G,AX329NHW6B7BA,10/19/11,0,1,2,"Novel idea, but needs work","I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."
81775,B005CUU25G,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,10/8/11,0,1,2,Three dogs -- not much interest,"I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long."
81776,B005CUU25G,A3EPJSPH03AS29,10/5/11,0,1,2,"My dog liked it, I didn't.","I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy."
81787,B005CUU25G,A1FWFCJU2G7TRA,10/2/11,0,1,2,Gus Says: Two Paws Down,"Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like ""Tussy"" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just ""lick"" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange ""treat"". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus."
81797,B005CUU25G,AID8OJP77VK6Y,6/5/12,1,3,2,Pros and cons...,"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."
81811,B005CUU25G,A1J5HLGE1X1ZLB,2/19/12,0,5,2,watch out...,"I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak."

The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."

None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs."
81832,B005CUU25G,A2XIOXRRYX0KZY,10/17/11,1,1,2,She just doesn't want it,"I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as ""I hate it.""<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon."
81836,B005CUU25G,ALDYWG0CPSYUF,9/19/11,10,15,2,I'm not sure what to think . . . and neither does my dog,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again."

On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count."
81873,B005CUU25G,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,11/14/11,0,0,2,Dog Doesn't Dig It,"My dog was pretty confused when I put this in his face. Whenever I do he'll lick it once or twice then step back and look at me like, ""Can I have a real treat now?"" At least he doesn't hate it, but he sure doesn't get excited about this whenever I pull it out.<br /><br />But don't go off my review alone, other dogs seem to like it. Just not my poodle."
81883,B005CUU25G,A28CCN6VYHRUKS,10/19/11,0,0,2,Interesting idea... so-so execution,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future."
81892,B005CUU25G,AQKK1FF4LFFBH,9/28/11,0,0,2,Weirdest thing ever,"First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this ""roll-on"" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it."
81899,B005CUU25G,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,2/4/12,1,2,2,Somewhat undecided,"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""

I normally use whole barley at home but needed bags for the office. I had brought some back from China on my last trip that I could not find in the US, so I tried this brand. These large bags are actually for a teapot, not a cup as I expected. As mentioned, the flavor was not full-bodied and so I will keep searching."

It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4  bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits.

Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else.

I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears.

We were visiting friends and we were served coffee which tasted very good and it was a bit milder than what we drink, so I asked about the brand and was told it was Jermiah's Kona mixed with some french roast.  I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged.  As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry.  I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee.  I tried it by itself, mixed 1/2 french roast, 1/4 ...without any success.  I don't know if I got a stale bag or what, but my experience left me with a bad taste. Amazon was great and they offered a refund.  Thank you Amazon!"

I also love starbuck christmas blend and have missed it since I got my machine. I thought these little caps would do the trick. They kind of work. The resulting coffee is pretty watery- the capsule look like they are not sturdy enough to handle the pressure of the machine, they are shrunken after use- unlike the real nespresso capsules. The coffee that comes out (again I am talking starbuck christmas blend) tastes fine, but is weak in overall strength and looks really watery. PLUS after foaming up my milk and adding it to the coffee- the coffee instanly 'melts/pops' all of the foam. Nespresso must do something to their coffee to make it not do this. I find this a point none of the other reviews touch upon."
82680,B005UP1M4I,A1XD3GN1QR454O,1/11/12,5,5,2,Compatible - almost...,"I purchased the NeCap Nespresso Compatible Refill Capsules a week after purchasing a Nespresso Citiz with Aeroccino milk heater/frothier. The Nespresso Citiz works flawlessly with Nespresso Capsules. Rich coffee with a beautiful crema. However with NeCap capsules the end result is hit and miss at best. I have tried Gevalia espresso ground espresso roast coffee in the NeCap capsules with poor results. I have tried Illy Espresso grind espresso roast with the NeCap capsules also with poor results. I have tried coffee from a local coffee house, freshly roasted and espresso grind with the NeCap capsules with poor results. I also tried India Black tea from a local India grocery with good results! Go figure.<br /><br />Preparing the NeCap capsules is a tedious process at best. Here are the steps:<br />Separate capsules from one another, this can be difficult as they tend to stick together.<br />Then separate the foil seals from one another, this can be difficult as they also tend to stick together.<br />Fill the capsules, press, then remove excess coffee with out accidentally removing the paper tape that protects the adhesive seal.<br />Sometimes the protective paper tape is not sealed carefully around the adhesive and coffee gets under the paper tape and sticks to the adhesive. Which of course needs to be removed for the foil seal to stick.<br />Assuming all goes well to this point one must then peel the protective tape and carefully align the foil seal over the capsule and seal in place.<br />These steps constitute a time consuming process which is not exactly loads of fun.<br />Lastly you must fit a small black rubber ring to the back of the NeCap capsule.<br /><br />In the box that includes all the bits needed to make a capsule is a note that reads: ""Nespresso recently modified their new machines after July/August 2010 in order to prevent the use of compatible capsules. Please use the black rings to attach to the capsule for the proper use for the latest model of Nespresso Machines."" Seems it may be time for NeCap to update their products.<br /><br />So the capsules aren't made for current machines and must be modified by the customer. Additionally the NeCap capsules are slightly smaller to avoid patent violation. These factors no doubt explain why some of the NeCap capsules won't insert properly in the Nespresso machine, or just fall through the machine to the catch tray. Lastly the coffee they make is not on par in any way, shape, or form with the capsules you purchase from Nespresso. Additionally I have noticed that the coffee made with the NeCap capsules tends to have grounds in it. Grounds don't bother me but it may others.<br /><br />Just so the readers know, I have filled a total of 43 of the NeCap capsules as of this writing. That was enough for me understand and to work through the process.<br /><br />All in all I will keep the NeCap package I bought and when I have time on my hands fill some with black tea. As for coffee, I prefer to buy from the Nespresso club.<br /><br />Summary: This is not a very well executed/designed product. The end result isn't up to the Nespresso standard. OK for Black India tea."
82685,B005UP1M4I,A3I3JRF4HZ26MC,8/23/12,1,1,2,Disappointing coffee,"I have to echo a lot of the other reviews:<br /><br />1.  The capsules are about 60% the size of the standard Nespresso capsules, so unless you like your coffee very weak, these Ne-Caps are not for you.  Even using as a single shot, the coffee tastes watered down.<br />2.  The version of of foil seals in my box are self-adhesive; much less fooling around than the peel-off rings contained in other kits.  Still this foil is much thinner than that found on standard Nespresso capsules, and may contribute to the excessive grinds that show up in the brewed product.<br />3.  I want fiber in my diet, but not fiber in my coffee; there are ALWAYS residual coffee grinds in the cup.  The brewed coffee often looks murky; there is always a ring of tiny coffee grinds.<br />4.  There are no instructions in the box, but the tiny rings SEEM to belong on the underside of the capsule, as without them the capsules tend to fall right through the slot on the Nespresso machine.  Why bother with the rings?  Why not make the the capsule tops a bit thicker in the first place?<br /><br />So until they make a bigger capsule, and solve the ""dirty coffee"" problem, this is a Two Star product."
82688,B005UP1M4I,A2FNAGH31RWZGI,4/1/12,1,1,2,Wouldn't do it again!,"You might think my great expectations for the Ne-Caps are the cause of the lower rating.  With a burr coffee grinder & a wide assortment of coffee beans I enjoyed grinding my own coffee and topping off the Ne-Caps.  It took a bit of time and care but I didn't mind.<br /><br />However, we have a Nespresso Clitiz and the Ne-Caps, even with the fitting rubber band required for this unit are a bit problematic.  They do not easily slide into the the Nespresso compartment.  The coffee is adequate, nothing to write home about.<br /><br />30 Ne-Caps into the process, I'm glad I tried it but won't be doing it again."

Taste is not full-bodied but rather ashy tasting and flat; it smells and tastes like cigarettes and coffee.<br />Also, I have to hold the machine closed while it's brewing.  The strange non-k-cup pod will not allow the machine to close properly.  The pods need to be stored in a ziploc or other airtight container.

83003,B007TGDXNO,#oc-R1J5TQWBNLGLAY,2/24/12,5,10,2,There are other ways of saving money with a Keurig machine!,"Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!"

I generally enjoy a full, dark roast and I like the bitterness of coffee.  That's the whole point.  But I was really unhappy with the finish in this particular French Roast and won't purchase it again.

My first cup (medium setting) was off-putting at best. I brewed my second cup on the small-cup setting, hoping for a bolder and richer flavour and mouth feel; none was forthcoming. I appreciate the less plastic packaging and don't find it a bad flavor - I personally don't find the intense boodness I look forward to in a cup of coffee."
83315,B005ZBZLT4,#oc-R2PWOJTSJYZRGQ,3/12/12,2,3,2,"Average, at best.

It is not very flavorful, particularly compared to other k-cup brands on the market.  But, this coffee is also 30-50% less expensive per cup.<br /><br />It's also worth noting (as other reviewers have) that these need to be kept in an air-tight container because they are not individually sealed; the bottoms of each cup are semipermeable filters--not air tight plastic like other k-kups.  This is inconvenient if you prefer to keep your k-cups in a k-cup tower next to the machine."

The SF Coffee K-cups do not look like other K-cups in that they do not have the plastic base which contains and seals around the coffee filter.  This exposes the coffee to air and faster oxidation.  When drinking the coffee it lacks a fresh flavor and tastes a bit stale.  The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.  The lack of the plastic housing around the coffee filter, in my opinion, causes the water to flow thru the coffee too quickly and contributes to a weak flavor.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy these again."

One of the best aspects of the single-cup coffee maker is that you get a cup of coffee that is strong (depending upon your preference), fresh and, tastes like a cup of coffee from one of the chain reatil locations, without the retail price.

Unfortunately it is not even close.<br />The first cup seemed fine. The flavor immediately after brewing is good, but as soon as it cools down some it turns harsh fast.<br />The open-filter is a poor design. It can and absolutely will go stale.  I compared the scent of the final coffee pouch(cup?) from a previously opened bag to a newly opened, and the scent is completely different. Think old coffee can vs. freshly opened.<br />The other gripe on the filter is the poor filtration. There is always sediment at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />About me: I am very picky about my coffee. I drink it straight black and brew at 8oz with double filtered water in a Cuisinart Keurig coffee maker.  I don't reuse k-cups!<br />My favorite coffees are Coffee People's Black Tiger and Jet Fuel, Caribou's Mahogany and Van Houtte's Eclipse."

It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again."

This defeats much of the purpose of a K-Cup, having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use. When I opened the bag, it was a great smell, as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere!<br />Know how do you keep the rest fresh? Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future."

Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more ""exposed"" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this ""OneCup"" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a ""house"" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant."

Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box."

The liquid center in these candies is gone and the cherries inside are all dried up.  Somehow the liquid filling either evaporated are just dried up as there is no sticky evidence of leaking in the box.  Also, the milk chocolate has a chalky look as if it has oxidized.  We can still eat them as they are okay, but they are not as advertized on the outside of the box as containing a clear liquid center.  I think it's obvious that these Chocolates are just very old and probably have exceeded their optimum shelf life.  I will not order from this reseller again."
83939,B004H4N59S,A37F5BQAYL9NFG,1/9/12,0,5,2,A big disappointment.,"Having been diagnosed diabetic I really miss all the heavy duty sweets to which I was accustomed.  My father and my husband were both beekeepers so I know what real honey should taste like.  This product definitely does not live up to anything resembling that taste.  True, it is sweet, and I must admit serves a purpose of sorts, but as for tasting anything like honey - no, it definitely does NOT.  I once made a 9x12 pan of baklava and ate all of it (except one small piece eaten by my husband) in 3-4 days - so, I know whereof I speak."
83945,B000FNJ5JO,A3R5BJC6OZ29CI,9/17/10,3,3,2,Inferior quality matcha.,"Ujinotsuyu Matcha Hagoromo is not nearly as good as some of the other brands of matcha I tried. Instead of being a pure green, it had a faint yellow-brownish tinge. It was also quite harsh and bitter-flavored. If you're willing to spend more money but don't want expensive tea ceremony grade matcha, try Do Matcha 2nd Harvest (the red label variety). It has a much lighter and fresher flavor. My local store also carries Maeda-en, which is better than Ujinotsuyu but not as good as Do Matcha."
83949,B000FNJ5JO,A2O5CCUSFNMBDB,6/6/09,1,2,2,Food grade matcha?,"I found the matcha to be very bitter and grainy. I had few bowls but it ended up being used to cookies which were very tasty. Also made some smoothies with honey added and they were a hit.<br />I didnt buy from amazon. I got mine from a tea shop in chinatown for $5/can. I wanted to see if you really get what you pay for.<br />I have been buying my matcha directly from japan(yuuki-cha, ippodo,o-cha) and i dont think its fair to compare since they cost $20-30/can.<br />if you are looking for a serious drinking tasteful matcha stay away from this one. But as culinary grade matcha its certainly a good value."
83950,B000FNJ5JO,A1SWN568W5HMV3,10/18/09,0,1,2,Pale green looking,"When I received it and soon after opened it, the matcha appears a pale green, as if it has been sitting in storage too long before they sent it. DoMatcha, on the other hand, when I first bought it was bright green and fresher.<br /><br />Not into this brand --  I prefer DoMatcha. . ."
83968,B004776JPW,A3AP5YYIQV98WR,11/12/11,3,4,2,Product freshness to expire soon,"I purchased this tea along with several other kcup varieties for a coffee maker that gets occasional use.  Unfortunatley, the expiration date on the Celestial Green Decaf Tea purchased here on Amazon is within one month.  I know I will be throwing away most of this tea because it will expire before it is used.  All the other kcups purchased have at least one year before they expire.<br /><br />The shipping to return the tea would have cost half the price of the tea.  I don't think I will purchase any more food items on Amazon."

The order was placed in early August. It is currently September and although I have written Amazon for resolution and they responded nicely, the order of pop rocks has yet to arrive. The rocks were needed for a fun way to introduce science lab books to a group of fifth graders. Do be careful from whom you order."

Even odder, the description of the product has been changed to make it even more misleading.<br /><br />This is NOT a 5 LB bag, it is a 2.5 LB bag, which means you're paying twice as much per ounce as you should.  This is a comparable price for the 5 LB bag.  The seller needs to change both the description and the picture, otherwise they're going to keep cheating customers.<br /><br />All of that is a shame, really, because this is a very high quality food that my cats love. I recommend this kibble highly."

Really, don't know about you but to me, that is way too much.  So open the bag of tea... no scoop... directions read in hot water put 2 sccops in... no scoop... huh?  Was just informed they don't put a scoop in every bag... what???  So while I may enjoy the tea... forget it, last time I buy from this company.<br /><br />The old buyer beware is how I would rate this company."

Big Bummer! Even worse was that every single one of them in this 5 pound bag were BROKEN. none of them were in one piece, the stem connected to the cherry. i used them for Valentine favors, and they were NOT cute like the raspberries, because they were in parts. the non-saur part was the Big let down. they may have come broken because they were shipped in the Dead of winter. tho they did not sit outside for one second. so not sure if they always come broken. i will NOT be getting these again."

84182,B0035A11OQ,ADHB7JK4M6J7K,3/10/12,0,1,2,Not good for my dog,"Although my dog(schnauzer) is a picky eater, she likes the Blue Buffalo dry food (lamb/rice and chicken/rice).  I have tried both the turkey dinner and beef dinner, and neither is very appealing to the dog.  I have been forced to give away the remaining cans I bought (not inexpensive) to others to see if dogs would eat them.  Not at all impressed with Blue Buffalo canned foods."
84218,B000FYVKRS,A38EJTA5VWIB0A,5/29/12,0,1,2,Meh,These are not very good. The taste is similar to slimjims but they're not as tasty. The texture is a little off too. A little mealy. If the taste was better or the texture was more appetizing they would have gotten a better review from me.
84219,B000FYVKRS,A2MRXYV1QYV1MD,4/7/12,0,1,2,Sour and mushy,"I finally received my order of  buffalo bills  hot shot Hot flavor 2.1 lbs. I bought this because of all the review. My first thought about the taste of this beef stick is that it tasted really sour and i tasted some spices but it was far from hot,it wasn't even hot at all. Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price. Overall, I wouldn't buy this beef stick because it taste mushy and sour, I'm sure it's not expired because  it says feb 2013. I knew i should've gotten the peperoni flavor beef sticks. Also, from all the other people's review i was expecting a sample from them since i read a lot of people received samples. I was kinda disappointed. So i won't be buying the hot shots again and its not because i didn't receieve a sample. haha"
84229,B000FYVKRS,A3P68S1EF4GEH9,5/10/11,16,17,2,didn't like the taste and texture,"I bought these on the strength of the reviews.  Inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy, and I didn't like the taste at all.  It tastes mostly of beef heart, smoke and spices.  I found them inedible.  I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.  I have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as I experienced with this company.  I think you can't go wrong buying from them.  He said if anyone doesnt like what they get, they will replace it."
84263,B000FYVKRS,A36CMGR5ELUM34,5/24/12,0,0,2,Mostly tastes of beef heart,"I've had several brands of beef sticks and am not a very picky eater, so was surprised that there was a pretty big discrepancy between how this product was reviewed here and how it tasted. To me it tasted more like beef heart than beef (and I have actually sampled beef heart before, so I know what it tastes like! Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.<br /><br />Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes."
84268,B000FYVKRS,A3KZUNVJHCLDUV,4/15/12,0,0,2,Wrong product shipped,"I ordered the mild sticks about 1 month ago an loved them. They were better than slim Jim's. Better flavor, less greasy. So I was running out and ordered more MILD sticks. I got the hot ones. These lack the snap of the mild so are less satisfying. The spice was nice, but still I want my mild sticks."
84281,B000FYVKRS,A26F56PK6A3DY2,1/11/12,0,0,2,JMarshall,The delivery was quick and the package arrived without issue. The reason for the 2 stars is because i wasnt satisfied with the Flavor . I just dont have a taste for it. so now i have 2 pounds of meat sticks that im not going to eat. the company did send a sample of its barbecue beef jerky which was really nice. next time i will have to order that. you win some and you lose some. it happens.
84287,B000FYVKRS,A2JXVMU6OMK6XI,2/6/11,0,0,2,Not a Slim Jims Replacement,"While the cost on this item is sure to bring attention, I found the taste to be a little bland while the product was dryer then I am used to with jerky of this type. Please note this is for the ""Hot"" version of this product (there are three flavors and I have not tried the other two so your millage may very on the other flavors) Shipment was fast and packaging was A1. Perhaps I'll give the other flavors a try."
84299,B000FYVKRS,A1Q5ZH607KG7E1,10/22/10,0,0,2,Somewhat greasy and mild tasting,"The taste was somewhat greasy.  Hoped for a product better than ""Slim Jims"" but they are not. They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product they feel I might like better."
84324,B000AP8FJ8,A8DRB62V7CKLY,6/23/11,0,0,2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in the ropes. They were tough to eat. If I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds, they were pretty good. I did get a response from the seller, and they said that they were in a warehouse, and due to the cold weather, they were firmer. The ropes were within their expiration --or shelf life date. I probably will not order them again."
84348,B0000DGF5S,ASZEZ9ZZ4V8JQ,12/28/05,8,9,2,Doesn't look like a bonsai tree at all,"Positive: Gardenia Bonsai arrived in good shape and packaged well.<br /><br />Negative: Did not look like a Bonsai at all, they advertise they are suppose to be 4 yrs old?? Mine looked like a normal Gardenia bush that was pruned way back and stuck in a small pot. I plan on returning it, my wife was disappointed because it was a christmas gift for her!"
84349,B0000DGF5S,AEU0TVTYJRUU4,12/29/05,5,5,2,Falling leaves,"I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as ""highest"" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.  We'll see...  M. Buchanan"
84357,B0000DGF5S,A1QU1YOTW6XKJQ,8/4/06,4,5,2,Not thrilled,"Not too thrilled with this one though.  Seems to not have any growth and getting yellower by the day.  I'm not sure it survived shipping very well.  It was moist when we got it, but there was only one bloom left on it which dropped after one week.  I didn't care for it any differently than the Jade, which sits right next to it on the counter.  The only thing it seems to attract is bugs.  We finally had to put it outside because it was getting pretty bad.  I think its still alive, but not sure how much longer it has."
84360,B0000DGF5S,A3QLJ9W9UKU80T,10/16/10,1,1,2,What was this?,"So it came with beautiful greens and full of flowers.  Was really optimistic, no instructions - i.e. how old is it? After the flowers died, it got fleas, which are soil related. It bugged my other plants. However, its a cutting of a shrub, not a bonsai. Its just stuck in a bonsai pot. Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year. Gardenias are hardy but delicate so I'm frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season I have to bring it in and I hate bugs."
84377,B000NMCQ7A,A37XJ5WSOL43I6,5/28/09,5,6,2,Very Bad Shipping,"Product was shipped lose in a large box, 3 times to large, resulting in the container breaking.  Most of the product was crushed, melted, and unusable. I will not be shopping with this supplier again."

84415,B000ETAJZ8,A2PNMCQ6FU5SHL,8/18/11,0,0,2,Ginger snaps are okay but I've had better.,"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally."
84419,B000ETAJZ8,A3RDMG6QT8TFFR,1/5/11,0,0,2,I knew that being diagnosed with celiac would change things....,"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook."
84426,B000ETAJZ8,A2GJ13F7WIYX2E,2/17/10,0,0,2,Meh.,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."
84456,B000ETAJZ8,A1EB0P87A48B3R,3/9/08,0,0,2,Not pleased with these att all!,This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar.  I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them.  Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something.
84475,B00176E2XM,A20OQMLRFNZADL,2/14/11,2,2,2,Sweet Leather for your dog,"I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the ""bone"".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well."

This seriously reduces the value.<br /><br />Beware the other Black Friday or Cyber Monday savings from this company.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for kicking off the holiday season with this bait and switch.<br /><br />I'm happy with Amazon 95% of the time.  They missed on this one.<br /><br />Postscript:  Amazon refunded a large enough portion of the purchase price to satisfy me.  Kudos for their honorable response.
84521,B003N0ZN0Q,A2X5LIUSVV0KKY,1/6/12,0,0,2,Sugar,I thought these were going to be dried fruit. Turns out it is dried but full of sugar. Not what I needed. Taste is ok though.

I have had a subscription for about a year now. The only problem is that the last 2 shipments have been for Strawberry Sensation and not for the Original Strawberry they are both good but I prefer the Strawberry. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN? I wouldn't mind having a subscription for both, but amazon.com doesn't have the option for the Strawberry Sensation and it's shipping me the wrong type of tea. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN?"

84695,B008Y5NJLU,ALAN629D6EKQZ,3/22/10,0,0,2,Not as good as belly flops,"I bought 10 lbs of belly flops a while back and those were so good and very sweet.  These jelly beans or not as sweet nor tasty. There seems to be a lot more root beer beans than any other ones.  They did not come in bags just a box of jelly beans.  The value was very good for the money, but in the future I'm only going to stick to flops."

They love Greenies so much because Greenies got by-products in the ingredients which taste really good but doesn't do good job for the breath. I would recommend Halo's dental chew than Greenies.
84718,B0013OXEC8,A3ZXLT1S1BUL0,5/26/08,1,4,2,Never recieved my whole order,"I usually do not leave negative reviews. But I was so excited to order this tea at such a good price. I ordered two boxes. One for me and another for my friend. Well, I would just like to say that this was the worst experience I ever had with an online order. I ordered two boxes of this tea and only received one. Then I got one box of the tea, me thinking this is weired. I sent an email to the company. I had to wait at least 2 1/2 weeks to get a response from my email. Granted, the owner emailed me back and said he was out of the country and did apologize. His wife was helping him. The thing is, if the help is not good or don't know what they are doing. It is like leaving your business on auto pilot and hoping nothing goes wrong! Well it did, things went terribly wrong! I did not even try the tea. The box I did get I just put it to the side. The owner did refund my money for the one box I never got, I thank you for that to say the least. But over all next time please do not leave you business unmanned. The results are not good at all!"

Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally."
84749,B000ETAJZI,A3RDMG6QT8TFFR,1/5/11,0,0,2,I knew that being diagnosed with celiac would change things....,"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook."
84756,B000ETAJZI,A2GJ13F7WIYX2E,2/17/10,0,0,2,Meh.,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."

I decided to go with grade B because of the $30 difference. I assumed it with just be veinier. It was veinier but also lacked that great earthy duck taste that you get with grade A and with the canned product. I felt like i was eating chicken liver or something. It wasnt worth the price. I suggest you continue to splurge on grade A. But if you are making a pate' then grade B might suffice- hope this helps"

Those were dark, robust, and fruity with plenty of flavor to stand up to cream.<br /><br />Well, these are not close at all. At best, it is a medium roast and cream just dilutes the flavor. Maybe OK if you drink your coffee black, but not all Kenyan coffees are the same. If it didn't say ""Extra Bold,"" I would not have guessed this was an Extra Bold K-Cup; the flavor just isn't there."

Compared with the other two it is thin and its flavor is too weak to stand up to other ingredients in a drink. I do give it bonus points for the nice bottle and pour spout, but it's certainly not worth its price and I do not recommend it for cocktail enthusiasts."

I did not want to travel a lond distance with wet grains (I could have shared my own) and thought it would be easier to bring them dried.  The product description here states that they are dehydrated grains...NOT true.  What I received was a padded manila envelope, a ziploc baggy with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of some very badly crushed, wet grains (looked like they got squished by the postage cancelling machine used by the Post Office), and a photocopy of instructions.  Not as described or pictured in this listing.  The grains smelled bad and so far, have not been able to produce good quality kefir.  Who is the product manufacturer...Real Man of Genius?

Luckily, this product was very reasonably priced so I won't feel too bad about tossing the remaining bags if I can't find someone to give them to.<br /><br />I can't fault the seller here.

I had never had anything like this, so I was not aware of what it would be like.  I did read the reviews and most people seemed to really like this product, so I gave it a try.  I did not like it!  It is very spicy, which to me did not seem fitting for a drink.  I was only able to get down half a glass of this.  If you are pregnant and looking for something to ease your morning sickness, try ginger tea instead.  I got some lemon ginger tea... it is very good!  Also try ginger hard candies.  I got some of those as well.  If you are just a lover of all things ginger, go ahead and try it!"

I typically pre-boil my noodles but the instructions on the rice noodles said no boiling was needed. So I made my recipe and refrigerated it for 2 days as usual. I cooked it for 50 min let it stand for 10 min before serving. I was disappointed that the texture was mushy - not the same firmness as the wheat pasta noodles. Perhaps it would have worked better if I made it immediately before cooking and cooked it for a shorter time.

I wouldnt buy again because so many pieces are hard to eat being chewy or vainy. Ah well have 3 more packs to give a try. The price was good but still I personally couldn't eat 1 out of 3 pieces.

I don't know if I got a bad batch, but all the jerky I ate had hard veins running through them. All in all, I would give 2.5 stars, but since I can't, and I don't like rounding up, I have to go with 2.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The Jerky is tender, but not overly tender.  It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.  I'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the US.<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />The flavor was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  There are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor."

It's tender and substantial, so points there.  The flavor though is mediocre at best; poor would be a fair description.<br /><br />Also, if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days.  Maybe this is a problem with other brands of jerky too.  I wouldn't know because this is the first time I have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly (see above's flavor comments).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't very good jerky."

THE NEW PURCHASE OF SEVERAL BAGS (ATE TWO SO FAR) HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING. FLAVOR PROFILE HAS CHANGED AND PRODUCT IS TOUGH AND DRY. GOING TO LOOK FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT BRAND. TOO BAD. PROBABLY GOT TOOK FOR A WILD RIDE (CRASHING) WITH THIS PURCHASE.
85413,B002DHTWNO,A1TRLVHP63H1KQ,5/3/11,0,1,2,Inconsistent,"I've tried all the flavors at least once.  Original and Teriyaki multiple times.  First batch of Original and Teriyaki was great, 2nd and 3rd batches too over-flavored.  Pepper was too peppery (and I love pepper).  Hickory was too strong/salty.  Just not consistent.  Not going to waste more money on this product."
85415,B002DHTWNO,A25W8OXAD3CUUS,4/29/10,0,1,2,"Tender as promised, but more salt and gristle than bargained for","By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else."

But, it's not ""all-natural with no chemical preservatives"" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?  Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities."

After reading the glowing reviews, I was ready for a taste treat. Not what I got.<br /><br />I've had many different jerkies, and made my own several times. In the old days, jerky was made to keep without refrigeration, and to have a handy food to carry along on the trail. Also to cover the taste of what was probably less than fresh beef.<br /><br />I like a spicy flavor, with just a little bite to it, sometimes a little sweet, sometimes with a teriyaki flavor.<br /><br />This product (at least the original flavor) is none of these things. It tastes like a piece of steak was partially cooked and partially dried with no added spices or flavors. Just a dull piece of meat. Gone also is the leathery texture of the jerky I'm used to. It is slightly chewy, but not the texture of real jerky that takes time to chew and allows you to enjoy it for awhile.<br /><br />So if that bland tasteless type of jerky is your cup of tea, this may be for you. It just doesn't ring my bell.<br /><br />Somewhat of a disappointing purchase."

While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself."

My dog is hesitant to use it because of the bad smell.  I have ordered other elk racks before and just be forewarned that this company does not clean the rack before shipment.  Other companies do.

I thought this would be the perfect solution.<br /><br />I did follow instructions to warm them up first.  I would pour boiling water over them for 4 minutes while my press-pot coffee brewed. I would then pour out the water from the cup and pour my coffee onto the now-hot Joulies.<br /><br />For me, there was absolutely no noticeable difference in how fast my coffee got cold - so I'd have to go through the extra step of pouring the coffee into a different cup so I could microwave it as the Joulies can't be microwaved.  What a Pain.<br /><br />I tried them every day for a week to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and then put them in a drawer someplace where unused kitchen gadgets go to die.<br /><br />I tried them in a thermos a few times and they seems to work ok (thus the 2 stars) but I don't really use a thermos all that often.

Um, I'm not impressed. My coffee remained too hot to drink initially (just as it would be WITHOUT them in it), and was cold within one hour (again, JUST like it would be WITHOUT them in it). In fact, the only thing different about my coffee with these little Joulies in it is there was a LOT less room in my cup for actual coffee because they're quite large and you need several in your cup. Maybe they're more geared for those who enjoy their coffee in travel mugs? And because I cannot speak to this I thought one star would be inappropriate.<br /><br />I will of course lie and tell my husband they're miraculous and wonderful. But secretly I wish he'd saved the $50 because my ice cubes have been working just fine for years and are what I'll continue to use when he's not around.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I just realized these things cost him $60 and decided to return them!"

It did have their big twisted noodles, which I'm also not a fan of. They tend to be tough and irritating. It is only 70 calories a serving, which is its only real plus. However, a lot of other Progresso soups are in a good calorie range and also a delight to eat. Try one of them instead."

Tabouli is made with Bulgar wheat.  This is couscous.  The packaging is very misleading.<br /><br />I only give this two stars because the finished product was edible, but not flavorful.  Moreover, in trying to follow the instructions for preparation, the first instruction says simply, ""empty package contents into bowl and add an equal amount of water.""

It is most effective (provided the directions are followed exactly) on very solid stool and least effective on soft/running stool. The obvious problem is the latter is exactly why one would purchase the product. We bought it to do a more thorough job picking up after our dogs on a multi-use trail. We bike with our dogs (using Walky Dog) and like to leave the trail as clean as possible for others and to ensure dogs continue to be permitted to use the trail.

Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.

She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body.

The boy chewed for about 7-8 minutes, then had enough. They stayed on the floor for them to enjoy at anytime, but they rarely have. And when they did chew them - well, I had small hard white pieces all over my rug. Needless to say, can't walk barefoot on the rug.<br />Sorry I made this purchase - especially at the price !

They have had several Nylabone toys, but this one is the least favorite.  Each of them tried it out, but they all got bored with it fast.  It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp.  That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys.  After handling it myself, I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth."

A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, ""Caramel""). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar."

My puppies absolutely loved them. We ordered another batch when we quickly ran out and this time we received very hard, dry sticks that would snap in half with a great deal of pressure but did not appear to be safe enough for my 20lb puppies to eat. We did give them one half of a treat each and were amazed at how LONG it took them to chew threw this small piece of treat. These are dogs that usually can chew through anything quite quickly. I held off writing a negative review until I heard back from the company. However their policy is that I must pay for the shipping on the return and I can not return anything opened. After numerous emails back and forth they appear to be unconcerned (at least they have not commented on) the fact that this particular bag appears to be defective and unsafe for consumption. The lamination on the bag itself arrived peeling. Upon closer inspection the product is made in China so the lack of quality control is not surprising, however the lack of concern and willingness to take responsibility by the seller is. We will be looking for new treats elsewhere. We are very disappointed; the first batch we received was great. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the first bag was fantastic as were the other treats in the same collection."

I love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short.  Unfortunately from what I can gather and the type of bitterness it is I am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil.  It has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes.  I am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again.

The mocha was not overwhelmed by the peppermint and I enjoyed all 32 oz of it. When it was about gone I checked the company's website for info and saw this one.  Peppermint Mocha is seasonal, but still I am looking for Mocha flavor.  White Chocolate Mocha...At the store where I got it they only had the 32oz.  Pulled it out of the cooler and checked the expiration date.  As soon as I got home I put it in the coffee and as I lifted the cup I got a waft of coconut, like I was on a hot sunny beach. The taste also gave me the impression I just took a sip of suntan lotion.  Not enough mocha like the Peppermint Mocha.  The ingredients have palm oil and I checked the Peppermint Mocha and it does too, but I never noticed it.  Not sure if I can finish the other 31.5 oz of this White Chocolate Mocha. One bad post mentions the taste another becauses of shipping, this IMO is another bad for the taste promoted as White Chocolate Mocha on the label. Should have checked the reviews here first...update...tried a little more.  Shook the bottle well. It's better than the first cup.  Still what I taste is a sweetened coconut with a little white chocolate, not the mocha punch that's in Peppermint Mocha.  I'll bump it up a star for the slightly less coconut, slightly more mocha(?) from the first impression."

In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy.

First of all the noodles are more of the traditional ramen noodle, not the thicker type you get with the Shin Ramyun. (So disappointment #1) Then the flavor of this was not good at all, it wasn't like adding kimchi to a bowl of the Shin Ramyun stuff at all. To be honest the flavor was quite off putting.

87185,B005OCXVUU,A2J3C326OXTFSA,10/18/11,0,0,2,"Devoured, but Allergic Reaction Coupled with Shedding and Weight Loss","I adopted a dog recently from a rescue organization - a pit bull/mastiff 3 year old - who came to me fat, happy and with an overall positive outlook on life, regardless of the fact that his owners had left him to rot in an abandoned apartment building.<br /><br />Being a first time dog owner, I put him on this food because it came recommended to me by my local pet store in Austin, TX and it was the cheapest quality dog food (by weight) there.  The dog ate this food for about three weeks and every single time I put it out in a bowl, he would devour it right away.  He eats really fast and this food does not cause him to choke or spit the food back up - although now, three weeks later, I almost wish he had.<br /><br />In about two weeks time, I began to notice patches of fur gone in his coat and LOADS of shedding everywhere in my small apartment.  I was using the Furminator to shed him about twice a week and one time, I drew blood.  He was also scratching and licking himself raw.  Within three weeks, his collar had gotten too big for him - meaning, of course, rampant weight loss.  That was it: I brought him to the vet and they told me it was hard to tell because he's a rescue and their medical histories are difficult to conclude - so, it could either just be the change of weather from summer to fall or it could be his food or it could be that he is just stressed out from shifting environments and owners.  I switched his food anyways, because I was tired of the fur and felt sorry for him, even though he loved the taste of Canidae.  Within a week, the shedding stopped and he stopped scratching.<br /><br />I dug up some reviews online about Canidae and the opinions seem pretty mixed.  Either people's dogs love it and do incredibly well on it or it causes extreme negative reactions, anything from nausea and vomiting to allergies, which is ironic considering it is grain-free.  After all the digging, I personally conclude that it is because Canidae changes their formula periodically and their quality, although rated highly in terms of their ingredients, is inconsistent because of their processing methods: as in, nobody seems to be quite sure where they process their ingredients and when they do change their formula, whether this change affects that process.<br /><br />Its such a shame because it is a bang for your buck and my dog loved the taste of it.  I just wish Canidae would be more transparent about their process and maybe tell their consumers why there are such polarized reactions by dogs when they consume this food.  Overall, it was definitely a learning experience.  For me, the food rates at 2 (not a 1, because the price is great for the quality of ingredients) since my particular dog's reaction was negative."

I have been trying to get away from diet coke, a battle that has been going on for years. I use stevia in the raw in pretty much everything now and was really excited to find a line of sodas that used it. I, or course, was carried away and ordered a case on auto delivery. Mistake. The sodas really are all SOOO sweet, it's nauseating. The makers need to lighten up on the stevia. I still enjoy the ginger ale but am forcing myself to try and get through the remaining case.

87831,B008O3G25W,A2L35P0VQE7LBN,10/3/11,1,2,2,"Roller Jams, Wasted Product","The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."

87837,B008O3G25W,A351GW55IKKNHU,9/28/11,1,2,2,"Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie","The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that."
87849,B008O3G25W,A3DH53FPYSP9E,10/4/11,2,4,2,"Dog was a fan, but I wasn't","I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently."
87852,B008O3G25W,A3C9Q3KTNNLJJ,6/10/12,0,1,2,Not so great says my dog,"This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways."
87854,B008O3G25W,A20ZMC10HTZ4ZW,10/19/11,0,1,2,Our dog's opinions,"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary."
87855,B008O3G25W,AX329NHW6B7BA,10/19/11,0,1,2,"Novel idea, but needs work","I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."
87856,B008O3G25W,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,10/8/11,0,1,2,Three dogs -- not much interest,"I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long."

She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy."

Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just ""lick"" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange ""treat"". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus."
87878,B008O3G25W,AID8OJP77VK6Y,6/5/12,1,3,2,Pros and cons...,"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."

The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak."

If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE.

None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs."
87913,B008O3G25W,A2XIOXRRYX0KZY,10/17/11,1,1,2,She just doesn't want it,"I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as ""I hate it.""<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon."
87917,B008O3G25W,ALDYWG0CPSYUF,9/19/11,10,15,2,I'm not sure what to think . . . and neither does my dog,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again."

On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count."

At least he doesn't hate it, but he sure doesn't get excited about this whenever I pull it out.<br /><br />But don't go off my review alone, other dogs seem to like it. Just not my poodle."
87964,B008O3G25W,A28CCN6VYHRUKS,10/19/11,0,0,2,Interesting idea... so-so execution,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future."
87973,B008O3G25W,AQKK1FF4LFFBH,9/28/11,0,0,2,Weirdest thing ever,"First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this ""roll-on"" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it."
87980,B008O3G25W,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,2/4/12,1,2,2,Somewhat undecided,"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""

They didn't taste a thing like Lemon-Heads and they weren't even remotely sour. That should be enough to claim false advertising. To add to this the shell was particularly hard, like ""boston baked beans"" shells and the flavor of the coating was not good. I wouldn't call it a terrible flavor, just mildly un-enjoyable. The flavor I could best describe it as would be the ""lemon scent"" in cleaning products. The almonds were fine."

I am a little surprised, since sweet potatoes are her favorite.  Maybe if your kids like apricot they will like this flavor, but mine didn't.

In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the ""raw"" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side."

I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.  It's true, our baby opens his mouth WIDE for this stuff.  He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.  If not...I'll just have to suck it up and bring homemade food with me everywhere."

It becomes only mildly acceptable (to some) when mixed with hot milk rather than water.<br /><br />Its only real use is that the empty cauldron can be used for a decoration around Halloween.

I bought this (although I bought it with a Harry & David label on it so it was probably more expensive!) and no one in my family liked it.  It is not hot chocolate - more like what they call ""white chocolate"".  I thought it would be a chocolately orange flavor, yum.  Neither chocolate nor orange flavor.  Only the color is orange.  A big disappointment, I ended up throwing it out.  The cauldron is cute, but the words around the edge don't come off so it's not really reusable."

Cinnamon Pastry is one example of a coffee I really enjoy.<br /><br />This variety pack however seems to be a mix of their least popular blends, or perhaps the batches that were slightly ""off"". And going off this experience I won't be trying any of the coffees in the pack on their own except for the Kona & Breakfast blends.<br /><br />The tastes were dark (burnt), bitter and unappealing, each cup made me regret my choice to reach for the coffee mug. Not to mention the after effects were not pleasant, I actually could feel the crappiness of these blends for hours.<br /><br />The French Vanilla was downright disgusting, I don't think they could decide if they wanted to make a soft vanilla flavor  or a strong vanilla liquor experience and it's a horrible mix of the two.<br /><br />Also, as previously mentioned, nearly half the box is NOT coffee but tea's that sound... more interesting than appealing.<br /><br />So if you're in for an adventure and don't really care about the taste of your coffee or tea, go for it!<br /><br />Otherwise... consider sample packs directly through the coffee company, they cost less and give you better options."

I paid about $.33 per K-cup which is a good price, however I thought the coffees were not that great.  I prefer the Green Mountain brand and I suspect for me, it will be worth it to pay a little more for them."

And go with bolds. Even if you like lighter coffees. These k-cups have a hard time delivering on larger water sizes (not all types do.) There is some not very good stuff in this pack... It would be great if they sold with just one of each so you could quickly figure out what you wanted without having a lot left over.

Could it be the soy flour? In any case, I get no taste of chocolate chips at all. Zero. Zilch. They might as well have left that out of the name. The texture isn't bad. It's crunchy and not overly gritty. But there are better gluten-free snacks out there. I hope."

I loved the fact that they came in individually wrapped packages (great  for travel, lunch boxes, etc).  Unfortunately, the taste was quite disappointing.  The cinnamon flavored ones were even worse.  Neither myself, nor my youngest liked either of them.  Granted, we are both somewhat picky when it comes to store-bought cookies.  I'd have loved to have given them to my oldest son (who has a real sweet tooth and likes most GFCFSF cookies I buy), but they have both soy and corn in them and he is allergic to soy and corn in addition to gluten and dairy.  Fortunately, I hadn't bought them in bulk on Amazon ...  I was surprised to see that they got such good reviews."

The baked chips are bland and they are coated in a film that changes their texture. They are to thick and just do not satisfy chip-craving. As the calorie in take is identical to that of the 'Simple 7' brand I'll stick with the latter, which is amazing."
88530,B004FRX40M,A3KU17ZOVU0E8I,6/20/11,0,0,2,Pretty Bad,I normally love these chips and buy them in the large bags. The individual bags tasted totally different - makes no sense. I through them out and bought the large bags which tasted great.

These truffles were almost past the expiration date and obviously had be stored in a non-climate controlled place.  The chocolate had been melted and the peanut butter nugat inside had melted down to blob in the bottom of the sphere.  These truffles were not a bargin at the price I paid for them. I will buy my next ones locally where I can be assured they will be what I am paying for and not something somebody is trying to get rid of.

They both use packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder.<br /><br />But sadly, this one's not that good. It's salty, and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between. And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.<br /><br />Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides. It's much better than the broccoli version... and way more yummy (if more expensive) than the regular <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HUI0"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Supermac & Cheese Pasta and Sauce, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>."

It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it."

I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty."

A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste. I would not purchase them again. I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness. Also the sticks get very hard."

Out of 18 different teas, the only one besides my favorite jasmine green that really appealed to me was the breakfast blend.  Maybe it was the fact that they were bags instead of loose tea, I don't know.  I just didn't like the flavors that much.<br /><br />However, the quality of the tea was decent for bagged tea.  It didn't seem like it had been sitting forever and getting stale.  Especially the floral teas, like the rose infused white tea, tasted fresh and the floral scent was vivid, but not overpowering.<br /><br />Also, it's a mix of herbal (no caffeine) and black/green/white (with caffeine) teas, if that's important to you."

Given that I am already familiar with these teas, I made this purchase because the product description included two teas that I had not tried.  I thought this was a new collection with a combination of new and old products.  Turns out that it was the same 'old' collection and despite what was in the product description, this collection did not include the two teas that I had not tried.  I thought it may have been a shipping problem because the two teas are also listed amongst the ingredients on the box.

I had been looking forward to receiving this so much, but wound up so disappointed. First of all, the product looks nothing like the picture shown on the packaging. It is not a croissant as we know it; it looks more like an ordinary roll and VERY small at that! What made it worse, is that as I was eating it, I kept wondering WHERE the creamy custard filling was. It wasn't until I reached almost the end, that I got it! Yes, the filling is delicious, but if they put in more than HALF a tsp. of it, I'd be surprised.<br />Another point to consider...why do they charge over $8.00 to ship this product, when it's as light as a feather? Please consider the product itself only costs $4.49!!!! I've never written a review before, but am feeling so outraged by this, that I felt I had to warn others."

Unfortunately, the glass material makes it bulky and hard to not dribble when you're drinking. Also, it's hard to store since I can't put it with my other utensils since it might roll around and break. So yes, I probably wouldn't buy another one but it's fun to use once in a while."

However, the actual scent of this deodorant was unpleasant itself. It was just an odd smell on the skin. In the applicator, it was fine, but on a few different people ( who rubbed it on their forearms to test), the scent was not a good one. I did not like the way it reacted with me. It also gave me an itchy rash so I had to give up on it. One person said it smelled like urine,not good at all! But I didn't give it one star only because it seemed to do its job by keeping away the BO, I think."

The ""Organic"" variety was not available this time so I ordered this other organic ""Tree Hugger"" variety. It seems that the flavor is much weaker for this variety versus the ""Organic"". On a side note, the taste is good if you brew a small cup (i.e. 6 oz)."

For me, it had a medium roast flavor, (meaning not too strong), and a slight burnt-bitter aftertaste. There is an ever-so slight hint of cocoa in the flavor, not to it's detriment. I did not want a super-strong coffee, and I was  hoping that this would not harbor the burnt/bitter aftertaste that some of the stronger coffees seem to have. In any case, I am trying to find a medium roast, good smooth coffee to replace the Van Houtte Kenyan k-cups, since they are not being sold now, and Tree Hugger is not the one to fill those shoes for my taste."

Just a tad too weakish and mild on the flavor for my individual tastes.<br /><br />I believe this is supposed to be a 'bold' Kcup. Which doesnt mean a super dark roast..bold refers to them adding I think 20% more coffee per kcup. However, when I shake a kcup compared to all other 'bolds' this doesnt seem to have as much coffee.<br /><br />Plus, it must be a light roast, as well.....<br /><br />Saw some reviews saying this is as bold as it gets...<br /><br />Man.,..if anybody things this is bold/dark/strong/rich.....then dont even try organic, jet fuel, black tiger, wake up etc....cause those are far bolder/stronger/richer/darker with a whole lot more flavor...each very unique as all CP blends are, including tree hugger...I just think tree huggers uniqueness is far to bland all around for me....."

Also, the taste of the new sugar version is very poor. We have tried O's cereals without sugar from our local Whole Foods Market as well as Barbara's, but we don't really like them. For some reason, nothing stands up to the old version of Purely O's. We have now substituted Amaranth Flakes by Arrowhead Mills, which is a superior yet delicious cereal in my opinion (as well as my 2 little girls' and husband's opinions). We have abandoned O's cereals for now, not being able to really like Barbara's or WF's versions, but we will buy them if the original Purely O's cereal ever comes back. Certainly, if Cascadian Farms won't listen to its customers, then some other company should hopefully seize a great opportunity here. Especially since O's are so beloved by and wonderful for (developmentally) toddlers, who may grow to love them young, and keep them as a staple in their diet for years, perhaps for a lifetime. The opportunity for a company here is strengthened further by the huge market of devoted parents of young children who will seek out the healthiest version of O shaped cereal that their children will eat and enjoy... and will even pay a bit more for the higher quality.

The problem is that is expensive to keep up a regular supply of coconut oil; this product was cheaper than our local health food store, though. The box arrived with oil stains on one side; it had leaked out from the packaging, so that was disappointing. It is also messy to pour it out of the very wide-mouthed container; it usually drips onto the outside of the canister. I must say that I will be sticking with extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil until the price goes down on coconut oil and more user-friendly packinging is available."

I thought that perhaps it would cook off, but it does not.  Nobody liked the flavor of coconut in food  that aren't supposed to have coconut.

And the quantity.<br /><br />First, the seals were intact on both jars in the 2-pack that I ordered. But there was coconut oil all over the inside of the box, covering the jars, and even on the shipping label. Again, the seals were intact and the jars had no cracks, so I'm not sure why it was all over the place. The white plastic jar lids that covered the seals were both cracked because there was no padding in the large box that it came in. So this was probably from everything rolling around.<br /><br />Now as far as quantity - both jars had huge gaping spaces in the middle. I couldn't see this until the jar was partway gone. Coconut oil is a soft solid at room temperature. It was like the sides and bottom were covered with oil to make the jar look full and then some was squeezed in on top. Both jars were like that. I submitted a shipping complaint and no one responded. You can do better with another product. This is a little cheaper but you are asking for a mess."

I don't know if I got a bad batch but the smell of the creamy cheese when I began mixing it with the hot pasta was so foul and nasty I had to open the kitchen windows to clear the stench out of the house. Mind you we're in MA with over 6' of snow right now piled everywhere and filling every nook and cranny available and minus temps and wind chills so believe me, I wouldn't have opened the windows and propped the back door open to get rid of the smell if it wasn't absolutely necessary.<br /><br />I remember having this as a kid, both powdered and creamy cheese but I sure don't recall it having a smell like this. It ruined all our appetites. Because the smell lingered throughout the house, we ended up leaving the house for a while and going out to eat after riding in the open air to clear our nostils. Terrible experience. I was thinking of keeping the remainder of the first order and making it when no one else is home to give to the 5 dogs, but on second thought, if it is a bad batch, I certainly don't want to feed it to my 4-legged babies. Out in the trash it goes and the S&S order canceled.<br /><br />Must admit I'm disappointed.

When I learned about Izze's FORTIFIED ALL NATURAL SPARKLING POMEGRANATE JUICE, I was rather excited at the prospect of tasting some. I was rather disappointed.  To begin with, even though this product is labeled as pomegranate juice, it's a misnomer because this is not real pomegranate juice.  Instead it's a hybrid containing juices from concentrates of apples, white grapes, pineapples, lemons, cranberries, pomegranates, and a few other added vitamins.  The other vitamins don't bother me so much, but when a product is labeled and marketed as pomegranate juice, that's what a person should expect to get, not a mixture of a bunch of juices only one of which is pomegranate.  Besides the false labeling, the drink is quite bitter and hard to drink.  Drinking the beverage straight from the cans doesn't quite cut it (it tastes a bit metallic) and I've had to pour the stuff in a glass with ice.  Perhaps the absorption of the ice takes away part of the bitterness, but I've found the drink tastes much better this way.  But, overall, you'd best just avoid buying the stuff altogether."

Others spray alcohol-containing, leaf-wrecking oils on the leaves, leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly, making the tea quality suck! Numi HAD it absolutely perfect. I was ready to tell you how to get, out of their tea, the perfect GENUINE Earl Grey tea, one where the tea wasn't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals (essential oils are almost all alcohol, after all; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in Italy)... and now, I'm just here to say ""move along, nothing here to see"" because in changing their fruit supplier or aging/malting process or -something- (the tea leaves wouldn't likely vary so much, the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process--yes, I'm one of THOSE tea drinkers, Steepster reviews and all), from the bags smelling like another brand, a rather costly one that starts with R and nearly rhymes with fishy, which has rather funky EG (that brand sprays the leaves, which Numi proclaims my shared disdain for)... well, what was--back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot--the first and only EG I would drink happily, a tea I went to specific 24/7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because I could at least count on the tea... well, it's a passing memory, one I have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with Numi, probably with an email expressing sadness.<br /><br />I DO overall recommend their teas: The lemon myrtle chamomile, now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it's the FLOWER not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile, is hopefully still as wonderful, their Moroccan Mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest, sweetest mint imaginable, impossible to oversteep for that matter, able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [whereas Stash uses PNW mint that is medicinal, which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or ... medicine!], and even for the ones like Golden Chai that aren't to MY liking, they're still well made, just not a blend I care for ingredient-wise...<br /><br />I simply can't recommend THIS Numi product anymore (and I hope as I use the last of my others this proves the ONLY one that got ""revamped"" somehow, the ""how"" seemingly the fruit, whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or... whatever they changed to make it a stinky-bagged, fruitless flavored, bitter chemical-aftertaste tea). I tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night, using my reliable method with precise timing and all, went away from it a full month, and in finding the last half box of the old, decided to compare them to be sure it wasn't simply me being thrown off. It's not. I don't deem it so unworthy that it can't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations, and it'll probably be a welcome addition, but I will NOT be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself, not when I have teas I genuinely love (as I did this, which was barely drinkable with a LOT of sugar that rendered it barely-even-tea anymore--before, it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk, but it was absolutely palatable with no additions)."

But the dogs don't know what's good for them, and they don't know when to stop.  Our dogs have been on rationed food in order to keep them trim and fit.  One of them, a labradoodle, scarfs up the food so fast that she has to have her small portions doled out to her in smaller portions.

For a regular diet, I just don't see the content this offers as matching up to some of the better designed foods out there for pets.

Usually, he is extremely picky about his food, and he normally does not like anything not chicken.  However, he seemed to enjoy this.  I thought that was great, until I checked out the ingredients.  While beef is listed first, which is important, the two next listed are soy and soy by products.  While they do have value as proteins, the value is no where near that of real meat, and the price per ounce is higher than what I pay for a dog food with lots more real protein value.  When it comes to dog food, all protein is not created equal.  If your dog is larger or a working breed, this food really will not give him the best protein bang for your money.  Most of the other ingredients are filler and empty calories. I think the coloring is a real poor choice.  The artificial chemicals used in coloring dog food are really just added to make the human consumer feel that the food is better balanced and has more variety, the color has no positive impact on the health of the dog.  I prefer to stick with more natural and healthy ingredients.  Not to mention that with the higher price per ounce, it is less filling and the dog will want to eat even more of it to fill the need for real protein.  While it may taste good to him, I would rather give him healthier food that is a better deal money wise and health wise.  I will let him eat it, since he does seem to enjoy it, but I am thinking of it more as a treat type item, and definitely not a regular part of his diet."

89647,B002LANN56,A3V15SFD7918WZ,8/16/12,0,0,2,"It scores about a 5 out of 10 on quality, a 2 on price.","This is far from the worst dog food on the shelf. However, MUCH better foods are available for MUCH less money.<br /><br />If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that's good for them, you probably won't pick this food. Yes, it's better than Wallyworld's Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it's far from great. Here's why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what's on the shelf at the store), this food includes corn. Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. The only good thing about this food is that beef is the first ingredient. After that, it goes downhill fast. There isn't another good ingredient until you get to dried green beans, and there's practically none in the bag (calcium phosphate and salt both come before the green beans). And that's the only other decent ingredient in the whole bag.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word ""corn"" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It's not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don't want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position (""meal"" is okay; just means dried meat. ""By-products"" are not okay: that means ground up bones and toenails). This food does okay based on this one metric. Doesn't make it great though.<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you'll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I'm frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn't mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, pedigree, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the ""good food usually costs more"" rule that I've noticed is Costco's dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />This food is incredibly expensive, over two bucks a pound. You can do a lot better. For that price, you can get any of the highest quality dog foods available locally.<br /><br />Where'd I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal's annual review of dog foods. It's the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the ""dog whisperer"" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don't use the ""but my dog likes this brand"" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it's not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn't make it healthy."

They digest it well and they are healthy.  I decided to give this dog food a chance because it's inexpensive, and I fell for the slick marketing. I'm not sure what I was thinking!  I thought they might turn their noses up at the new food, but they loved it.  I only gave them a handful each to test it out, and I think they thought they just received a handful of treats!  Many hours later, however, their stomachs started to rumble and they became a little sick.  The low quality ingredients are hard to digest, especially for dogs that are used to human-grade foods  (in other words, they eat REAL food).  I feel guilty for even trying this.  I'll stick with organic dog foods from now on.  They do cost more, but when your dogs are like family, why skimp on something so important?  I recommend Newman's Own dry dog food for a lower cost organic that is still high quality."

I give my dog 1 piece and it keeps him occupied with chewing for a good 20 minutes.<br /><br />As far as ingredients go, yes, the first ingredient is in fact beef. However, everything that follows is a junky filler - soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat, rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, etc. Hasn't Purina (the maker of this dog food) heard that soy can be terrible for dog's stomachs?

It also says theres no artificial perservatives and that the #1 ingredient is the beef that your dog wants.. but... is this what your dog needs???<br /><br />Just because the product looks good and colorful and says your dog wants it doesn't mean its good for him. This was more like a treat for my dogs then ""food"" and even then a very unhealthy treat. There is a ton of soy and corn in this food and by products. I think the colored bites are more to please the humans then the dogs! That means there are aritifial preservatives or flavors or colors of some sort to get the colors. Does a dog really need this? but mainly is it healthy.... For a 4.5lb bag of unhealthy food it is pricy too.<br /><br />You are what you eat... and if you give your dog a healthy food with NO byproducts and no corn etc.. your dog will be alot more healthy (and less gassy if gas is a factor) I'd recommend trying good healthy food for a week or two if your not already, you will see a difference and there are a bunch out there on the market. Yes they are more costly.. but think of the benifits as well. Why give your dog stuff thats unhealthy? Can lead to problems... and more bills.<br /><br />I don't recommend this food, and my dogs enjoyed their short treat while it lasted.

89746,B002LANN56,A13H5US9Z7L9M7,8/15/12,2,2,2,Struggled with this rating because my dog loves it.,"I picked this up on a whim. My thought was to uses a very small amount as a sort of snack for my dog before bed.<br />I do this with my cats, too. I give them each a very small amount of a dry cat food that is low on the nutrition scale,<br />but high on the cat  junk food scale. I had been giving my dog an oatmeal biscuit or two each night. When I saw this<br />I thought I would try it and give him the same sort of treat as I do the cats.<br /><br />First of all, he loves it. He practically kisses my feet when I give it to him. It has an odd texture, in my opinion. Sort<br />of similar to a handful of raisins, not quite dry but? And Duncan gobbles it up and clearly wishes for more. I have a<br />fairly spoiled dog. Due to health issues, I cook for him every week. He eats cooked fish, beef or chicken with rice or pasta<br />peas, and some supplements. So if I ever do give him dog food in any quantity at all, it is a very high quality, not so yummy<br />as this ( apparently) dog food. So I am very concerned with what is in the food he is given. I see no problem with a tablespoon<br />or two a night for my 70lb dog, but I would not feed this as his sole diet. The nutrition value is very low, which is usually the<br />way it is with the food dogs like best.<br /><br />So, I really wanted to give this a higher rating since he likes it so much, but since I am writing this for dog people who are<br />surely interested in keeping their dogs healthy as well as happy, I had to go with two stars. Now, as a treat, or an occasional<br />meal, I see no problem with this. Dogs enjoy junk food, too."
89747,B002LANN56,A1XFI340SHOS5K,7/24/12,2,2,2,nice looking junk,"The rating is one star because the dog liked it a lot and one star in thanks for the Vine program which allows us to try products without spending good money on them.<br /><br />My dog is 130 Mastiff and he did not like or eat the Beneful dog food that we reviewed a few months ago. Not so with this bag. He was interested in the smell as soon as I opened the bag and ate the whole bowl when it was placed in front of him. He is not a dog who is normally interested in food. He doesn't beg at the table, shows no interest in scraps and usually has to have wet food mixed in with the dry before he will eat. His preferred diet is couches, dog beds, remotes, eyeglasses, and a 9"" ratchet wrench. Yet he likes this food. I wonder what the attraction is , since he usually shuns table scrap meats.<br /><br />In spite of the fancy name, the colorful textured kibble, the grilled sirloin label, this bag is full of stuff that is not good for dogs as a daily diet. Too much soy, soy products, artificial colors, etc.<br /><br />We will be using this bag as a training treat, because he seems to like the taste, but we are still on a hunt for real, unadulterated, healthy food."

Fortunately, the picky eater is the chihuahua.  Part of the picky eating comes from his sensitive stomach, and we avoid chicken and turkey because that consistently upsets his stomach.<br /><br />The first time he was offered Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, he devoured it with pleasure, and I was ecstatic to have a dry food that got some enthusiasm.  Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was gone by the next day, and he absolutely refused to eat it for two days.  We gave up.  If he'd rather eat the big dogs' food than eat his premium food, there is no  point in spending extra for a more expensive food.<br /><br />From my point of view, the ""premium"" seemed to be mostly the ""Chef Michael"" name, as it didn't seem to have any better ingredients than the other Purina foods.  Beef was the first ingredient, but it was followed by soy meal and soy flour. (Can we say GMO?) It also contained chicken by products (a long ways under the soy products, by the way.)  Even salt appears before green beans and potatoes.  It is cuter than regular kibble, but I don't think the dogs care.  It also has varying textures, but once again, even when I let the big dogs try it, they weren't overly impressed.<br /><br />My opinion is that either spend more and get real premium food or save your money (unless you want attractive kibble) and just buy a standard dog food."

It has to be great!<br /><br />My dog ate it quickly, but then again, my dog isn't a picky eater.<br /><br />I had a bag of Blue Buffalo. I try to feed my dog better food. Here are the list of the first few ingredients: deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground brown rice, whole ground barley, oatmeal.... etc. etc.<br /><br />This is what is in the Chef Michael's: beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed tochpherols(eh whats that?) brewers rice, soy protein concentrate etc. etc.<br /><br />As you can see there is a big difference. While the food looks decent. Its softer. The brown stuff looks like meat. And it has bits of yellow/brown and green hard nuggets.<br /><br />While your dog will probably eat it, I'd say spend the extra 4 bucks and get a bag of something better. Its $13.87 in the store for a for a 4.5 pound bag.  I think I paid $17.00 for a 6 pound bag of BB.

Sounds like something I'd want to eat. But read further, and it's ""sirloin flavored"" and is full of corn and other fillers.  Sure, the way my dog devoured this looked like I had not fed him in days - he was ready to lick the chrome off the bowl. ""Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin"" is a name dreamed up by the marketing department.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the food is flavor and filler, low quality protein, and high in carbs/calories.  If your dog is a lay-about, couch potato, indoor pooch - this stuff is better as a mix-in for finicky eaters, or as an occasional treat. A dog will have to be pretty active to burn off the calories if this was his/her staple.<br /><br />A week later? The dog won't touch it. Just nuzzles the stuff and gives it a tentative lick.

First I looked on the bag to see how much I was supposed to feed my dog. One cup per 10 pounds. One cup per 10 pounds! That's 8 cups/day for my large dog. There's a lot of filler in this dog food. I feed 3 1/2 cups/day of my regular dog food.<br /><br />So, I thought maybe the Chef Michael's would be better used as a replacement for just a small portion of the regular food to give Buck a treat.

It can be deceiving that beef is the first ingredient. But as it is explained in the review at dog food advisor, that is the weight of the beef before drying and processing - which contains a lot of water. So after processing, it is probably a much lower percentage of ingredient. Then there were other questionable ingredients including animal fat - the origin can be from a number of gross places, and a high corn meal content.<br /><br />So, I think much of the high price comes from the processing to make it look better to us and therefore make us feel better giving it to our dogs.<br /><br />I think I'm going back to my 4/5 star Kirkland dog food."

Additionally, it contains other questionable ingredients incuding animal digest (chemically hydrolized by products sprayed on the food to improve the flavor), chicken by products (essentially rendered slaughterhouse waste) and artificial colors. It also includes menadione which is a form of vitamin K suspected in allergies, liver toxicity and abnormal breakdown of red blood cells.  The food itself had little odor and an relatively attractive appearance. Luckily my dogs, who usually don't show the best judgment with their food choices,weren't too enthusiastic and only nibbled reluctantly.<br /><br />I believe what you feed your dog impacts his health.

Manufacturers can say anything they want and the burden of proof is on you (the consumer).  In the end, what you choose to feed your dog boils down to whether the dog likes the food, the food's nutritional content and ingredients and the track record of the dog food manufacturer.<br /><br />I recently reviewed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>, and this product contains a slightly better ingredient list.  However, the first ingredient is beef, followed by two fillers--soybean meal and soy flour, and the questionable tallow preserved in Vitamin E.  The rest of the ingredient list is similar to Beneful with respect to the other fillers: corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn and other unmentionables such as the ubiquitous poultry by-product meal and animal digest.<br /><br />As I said in another review, my schnauzer would eat almost anything, and this food was no exception.  Although I'm happy to see a reduction in the bad, bad things that are in Beneful, there are still plenty of fillers and potentially allergy inducing ingredients in this food.  I cannot in good faith recommend this food.  As with all dog foods, I recommend reading the labels on several different products if the ingredient list is something that bothers you (and I contend that it should).  While you will usually pay a little more up front for a quality dog food, the payoff will be increased longevity, vigor and vitality."

So far the only dog food that I have found that he really loves is Purina Beneful.  I have tried giving him this a couple of times and none of the times has he taken any interest in eating it.

And the food is a bit ""moist"" and in my experience working in a pet store dog food with moisture can easily start to bread mold and other bacteria. I'm not saying this bag had mold but it's a concern I have. My dogs did like this food, it's a nice treat for them but I think I'll stick with my current brand. Sure I'm paying about 25% more per bag when matching pound for pound but the food I feed them now doesn't contain the fillers, doesn't contain the coloring and doesn't have moisture built into it which creates some worry but also creates more weight so all in all it's less food when you consider it. Plus in my house my dogs don't do well with moist foods. It creates a mess on the back end if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I would pass on this, it's ok for the occasional treat or change if you want to mix it up a little bit (ensure you do so responsibly so you don't get your dogs sick), but I wouldn't make this a daily food for them."

This misses the mark for dogfood. My dog did gobble this down because it was something new. For my dogs overall health this does not work. I think that you should read the packaging then see what you think is good for your dog.
89968,B002LANN56,A4KJTS5P78ICU,6/24/12,1,1,2,My Dog LOVED it BUT,"My dog is a very picky eater and she loves this dog food so I thought I hit the jackpot. However, after looking at the ingredients I have found that I have NOT hit the jackpot. This dog food contians a lot of corn, wheat, and food coloring which I do not like but I can live with. The main ingredient I do NOT like though is the ANIMAL DIGEST and I cannot live with this being in my dogs food. I will NOT be giving my dog this food again. Chef Michael should be ashamed that he put his name on this dog food. I wanted to give this dog food one star BUT my dog did like it so I bumped it up to 2 stars but I will not give it any higher rating than that."
89969,B002LANN56,A1BTG38XSGYLW3,6/20/12,1,1,2,"""You can put lipstick on a pig....""","The only thing that really bothers me about this dog food is the lengths they go to in order to dress it up as something more than it is.  It's a basic dog food, marginally better than plain old Purina Dog Chow, and does meet dogs' basic nutritional needs.  My dogs were happy to eat it (but they've never met a dog food they didn't like).<br /><br />However, as someone else noted, it is very cereal-heavy, including grains such as corn and wheat that many people prefer to avoid in their dog's food.  Calling it Grilled Sirloin doesn't mesh with its being primarily cereal.  That's like calling your bowl of Wheaties a milkshake because it has milk in it.<br /><br />The ""potato and green bean garnishes"" are just that, garnishes, on the order of a small twig of parsley on your plate.  Potatoes and green beans are near the bottom of the list of ingredients, if you don't count the many added vitamins (if the ingredients are so good, why are so many vitamins added to meet nutritional standards?), preservatives, and artificial colors.  What you see in the mix is extruded kibble dyed green and yellow, not actual pieces of vegetables.<br /><br />So, we have a bag of cereal called ""sirloin,"" with dyed green and yellow bits implied to be beans and corn, mixed with kibble extruded in a way that makes it resemble meat.  I wish they'd put more effort into the recipe and less into the disguise."
89973,B002LANN56,A3DH53FPYSP9E,6/5/12,5,7,2,Dog loved the taste but I disliked the ingredients,"My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up.<br /><br />+ Some moist and tender food chunks along with the kibble.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as Soy, Chicken by-product, wheat, corn, artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. Artificial colors? Seriously? Do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it? Who are we trying to appeal to here, the dog or the person?<br /><br />- Expensive for a 4.5lb bag.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food.  However don't we all enjoy food that's bad for us? Unfortunately, that's exactly what this dog food is, bad for your dog. Someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that. Lucky for him I know what's good for his health and Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food isn't it. With so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it's hard to really recommend this food for your dog. I definitely wouldn't purchase it again. Our current food is Nature's Domain Turkey Meal and Sweet Potato which is sold at Cost Co. It contains no potentially harmful ingredients, settles very well with my dog and is only $30 for a 25lb bag. If you're looking for a good healthy food, I recommend Nature's Domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what's actually in your current dog food I suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor.com. It's a great site that lists nearly all dog foods, breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food's quality."
89982,B002LANN56,A37NODCIL8PP75,10/17/12,0,0,2,Ingredient list doesn't cut it,"The quick way to evaluate any dog food is to look at the first ingredients in ingredients list. For Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, we have these as the first eight components:<br /><br />Beef<br />soybean meal<br />soy flour<br />animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of vitamin E)<br />brewers rice<br />soy protein concentrate<br />corn gluten meal<br />ground yellow corn<br /><br />... This is not a good list. Beef will shrink and lose its water after cooking. Soybean meal and soy flour boost the protein level, but provide less quality to this food than would actual meet. Animal fat could be any sort of gross restaurant or slaughterhouse leavings, according to the DogFoodAdvisor website. Brewers rice, soy protien concentrate, corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn are all immediate red flags of little nutritional value to a dog.<br /><br />As with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JRUT6"">Purina Beneful Healthy Radiance, 7-Pounds</a>, this is yes beautifully packaged, but not really that good for your dog. I'll stick with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFIY92"">Verus Life Advantage Chicken Meal, Oats And Brown Rice Formula Dry Dog Food</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFSBC2"">Verus Advanced Opticoat Diet Menhaden Fish Meal And Potato Formula Dry Dog Food</a>"
89993,B002LANN56,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,9/26/12,0,0,2,Low Quality Dog Food,"Unless you are already feeding your dog a low end dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is not something I'd recommend feeding to your pet.<br /><br />I try to feed our dog better grade dog food.  Right now he is eating Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix.  There are several other high quality pet foods available.<br /><br />If you'd rather skip this review and are looking for a better quality dog food, there are several out there, some of which strive to serve ""natural/organic"" products.  Here are justa few, listed alphabetically:  Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, Merrick (who recently merged with Castor and Pollux), and Wellness.<br /><br />Chef Michael's is a Purina product.  While not trying to malign Purina, I am not aware of any better quality dog foods they produce.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order, directly from the label:<br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. C-5900.<br /><br />Nothing against beef for my dog, so it doesn't start out bad.  But after that....soybean meal and soy flour are just ""protein fillers"".  The next largest ingredient is animal fat.  Animal fat can come from numerous sources, including rodents, diseased animals, and you really just don't know the source.  After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is ""chewy"" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a ""candy"" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all."
