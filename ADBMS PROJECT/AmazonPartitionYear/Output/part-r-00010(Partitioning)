08	64163,B001E6EJX8,A1MAB962ZLTD7F,1/11/08,1,2,5,My favorites,"I love this bars,i'm a chocolate woman.I love the flavor and the price is good.Hurray for Kellogg's,and Amazon for the price."
08	64168,B000KKQNJM,AO948VPP2SMJ6,12/6/08,52,53,4,Not bad...,"I put this kit together tonight with my two young sons and we had a ball. (We paid $10 for it at Fred Meyer, which was $5 off their normal price, so beware that the cost on this site is ridiculously high). The pieces were easy to assemble and the tray that comes with the kit is handy (beats having to find some cardboard to cover with tin foil. My only complaint is the frosting because it got overly gooey before we could finish our assembly and it wasn't tough enough to hold some of the heavier candy. I kept putting it in the fridge to firm it up a little. I'd also recommend cutting the tip of the frosting at less than the 1/4"" that the instructions recommend. I'd say 1/8th"" would have been better. Overall, I was impressed with the finished product. It was easy to clean up the mess, there was plenty of candy and some to spare, and the kids had a blast. I bought a similar kit in the shape of a train and we look forward to putting that one together as well."
08	64169,B000KKQNJM,A2HPGWEOR4NUAQ,11/22/08,19,21,5,awesome for the price,"but I found it at target and paid $8.00... great kit, but look around because 13 bucks (and almost 10 to ship) is too pricey."
08	30653,B0010TEJBQ,A2YAMK73FO067G,9/22/08,7,7,5,Best Tasting Bar Ever!,"Honey Stinger Peanut Butter 'N Honey are THE best tasting energy bars out on the market!  I use them on 70-80 miles bike rides and they provide enough fuel to power me through my long rides.  The taste is awesome...almost like a candybar (think Butterfinger)...and they sit well in my tummy. I wish more stores carried them locally, but to be honest...Amazon was the best price that I found online, for a box of them."
08	64173,B000KKQNJM,A2YN79O9Y0UCDB,8/24/08,8,8,4,Good activity for Christmas,"Pros:<br /><br />-Great kit, came in good shape, nothing broken except maybe a candy cane or two.<br />-Ton of candy, a lot more than you'd need.  I ended up eating half of it on my own<br />-Easy to make, simple, whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />Neutral:<br /><br />-Frosting is a little hard to use until you get it really warm (requires some hand stamina)<br />-Base is a little boring, some parts are bigger than the pieces (such as the foundation for the stick men to stand up or trees) so it was harder to get it to stand up<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Shipping price is a little exorbitant for the size and shipping quality"
08	64174,B000KKQNJM,A1BZYEAQ56C5QZ,7/26/08,7,7,4,"Works fine, looks nice, shipping pricey...","This kit made a nice gingerbread house with everything included.  It's not too hard to make something as nice as what you see on the picture.  The snowmen and Christmas tree were a little tricky to stand up in the frontyard, but we got it to work eventually.  As another reviewer mentioned, the shipping does add over 50% to the cost, so watch out for that before you buy."
08	64176,B000KKQNJM,A27T6EUGCO7CV,12/28/08,6,6,5,Best Kit ever!,"By far, this has been the best kit ever. The frosting is already made to go (unlike some others where you have to mix the powder). Also, the frosting is truly sticky and holds the gingerbread parts super well. Every other kit I've ever worked doesn't do so good. Also, there is this tray where the base of the house goes and holds it well. It was just the best. I plan on buying the same one next year."

I found the Decaf is smoother tasting than the Regular French Vanilla.  I bought 4 boxes I was so excited to see it.  I have enough to last for a while now!!
08	64184,B000KKQNJM,A12O6OG8BCMW4M,12/15/08,3,3,4,Great price Quick shipping,This company is a pleasure to deal with. Customer Service was a joy. Would definately order from this company again.Had a slight problem with gingerbread houses and they were a joy to deal with.

I look forward to having it owned and distributed by one of the majors so that I could easily purchase it locally.  A big hit with family and friends.  Refreshing, tasty, thirst-quenching...terrific!"
08	48129,B004SRH2B6,A1PP9KH94ES51G,3/9/08,0,0,5,Yummy,I like  ZICO as a thirst quencher.  It feels healthy and refreshing. I do wish it was a bit cheaper though.

One of my dogs sometimes won't eat her regular food, or will eat it slowly, but she will always eat her Greenies right away."
08	64244,B000KKQNJM,A3QDXFO3B9YU7C,6/30/08,4,19,1,Broken in a million pieces,I had this shipped to my home while I was on vacation so I did not see it when it arrived.  When I got it it was broken in many pieces and unusable.  I will never do business with this company again.
08	64277,B000FFM7U6,A30HHGQ1P5OXTZ,4/16/08,2,2,4,"Not for everyone, but very interesting...","This tea is exclusively dried lime peels, so it's an unusal flavor.  It's not a fresh lime juice-y flavor, but a somewhat bitter & concentrated taste.  It is not terribly tart; I only add a little honey.  There is a bitterness to it, though - think of the pungent, bitter flavor of any citrus zest.  It will certainly not be a tea for everyone, but I could see myself acquiring a taste for it (I look forward to trying it iced!).  It's definitely an intriguing addition to my tea repertoire, if nothing else.  If you're not sure you want to purchase a whole box, try a Numi sampler - it includes two bags of each flavor, including Desert Lime."
08	64287,B000SANUC2,A2TD88272WFWBR,3/6/08,1,1,1,Too Spicy,"This my be my personal pet peeve but this tea is more spice than tea.  When you can no longer taste the tea amidst the jungle of spices then you've missed the point.  To top it off you can't return it because it's a grocery item... so i'm stuck with $16.00 worth of tongue numbing, overly spiced tea."
08	64304,B001EO5YAC,AXVIGDZ5UVXQC,4/25/08,8,9,5,The best coffee for the best price... PERIOD!,"This is my usual, day-to-day, coffee and there's really not much I can write about it other then ""its great"", ""the best I've tried and I've tried most all"" and ""its worth its price!"".... blah blah blah.. its coffee! ... if you like it, then its good - if you dont, then it's not... Just like wine - dont let anyone tell you what to like.<br /><br />Here's what I *can* say though - this is the best price... especially when you setup a subscription through Amazon. My only wish is that they would carry the larger bags but given the price, I'm good with the smaller ones too... Each bag fills up my espresso machien (Jura Capresso E8) in full and carries me through a week of coffees (I have friends who come over frequently, so its not just my habit ;-).<br /><br />I setup a subscription for 2 X 4 bags every two months. When I need more, I just login and have my shipment sent out sooner... simple as pie.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
08	64306,B001EO5YAC,A36JCSQANTAT0U,2/22/08,4,4,5,smooth,"this coffee is a medium roast, smooth flavor that is great for brewed coffee, not too heavy or bold nor too light. not for espresso. my corner bakery does however use the same brand, but different roast for their espressos. one tip grind beans only up to a week before using, produces fresher, tastier product."
08	64311,B001EO5YAC,A2K2LYXYI9U5JR,4/20/08,2,2,5,Very smooth,I have been using the Lavazza Qualita Oro beens since October of last year.  They are great. Very smooth (non-bitter) taste
08	64318,B001EO5YAC,A2K0WIEQZFJGKC,5/26/08,2,3,5,Just like in Italy,"This is a great value for beans that make rich, creamy espresso and crema coffee just like in Italy.  I use it in an automatic Saeco machine and get great results.  However, as you'll see from other reviewers, don't get this if you are trying to duplicate the mass-market barristas, as this is a flavorful dark roast, but not an acrid one."
08	39597,B000ZVVI0A,A19KF4NUELGE90,2/13/08,17,23,5,A good source of health,"Chicory Root, a common caffeine-free substitute for coffee, has also been used medicinally in the treatment of gout, dyspepsiaand jaundice.In addition to enhancing digestive processes, chicory helps to keep the liver healthy. The inclusion of chicory root supplements in the diet supports the proper metabolism of cholesterol.In contrast to coffee,Chicory Root is a natural sedative  one of the highest natural sources of inulin. Inulin prevents precancerous changes in the colon.<br />Chicory root has the effects of lowering cholesterol, reducing the pulse rate, and aiding in stomach and liver complaints. It is believed to increase the flow of bile.  Among other internal uses are those for sore throat, hemorrhoids, tuberculosis, abdominal cramps, melancholy, deafness and rashes."

I cannot say enough about it....it's sweet as candy...it does not raise blood sugar ...is goes a long way, using only a tiny bit....it is sheer pleasure to a diabetic...and if not diabetic  ....still sheer pleasure...and it does not in any way alter the taste of whatever you put it in, except to sweeten just like regular sugar.  You cannot get this product at a better price than right here on Amazon.com."
08	46059,B001EO5QZK,A3KY6HIM0HCIGG,1/21/08,3,3,5,Excellent breakfast tea!,"I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.  If you only have a little left in the tin, it blends well with any other black tea."
08	64335,B001EO5YAC,A3TJTP4NOLVJUF,12/26/08,0,0,5,Real Coffee at It's Best,"I've been traveling for many years and tried the best coffee in many parts of the world. Places where coffee is considered much more that a hot beverage with flavor. When I came to live to the United States I wanted to find a gourmet coffee that I could regularly order and don't spend huge amounts of money. I've tried several commercial coffees, including Illy. This coffee gives you the best bang for the buck. I ordered other blends of Lavazza that I still have to try, but so far so good! I don't even get close to a Starbucks anymore."
08	64336,B001EO5YAC,A10QWL6SE74JBT,9/2/08,0,0,5,YUMMMMMMM eeeeeeeee,This coffee is grrreat! Smooth and not a bad after taste. I am drinking it right now and was searching online to see where I could get another batch. My cousin just brought me some from italy and she is also inlove with it! Yes - the packaging is annoying but I have a coffee tin that I pour the grinds into so that is not a big issue for me.
08	50014,B000E5C234,ACYR6O588USK,2/12/08,6,36,1,Too Artificial,"My girlfriend bought me these, she has a sweet tooth and loves kid's candy.<br /><br />I told her never buy me these again if she loves me. Enough chemicals in it for a nuclear explosion.<br /><br />It's also fish tank gravel texture.<br /><br />I would not recommend this candy to my worst enemy."
08	64337,B001EO5YAC,A2DO52KF339849,9/2/08,0,0,5,Excellent espresso coffee without the bitterness,"I use the Lavazza Qualita Oro beans in my Automatic Espresso machine. Subjectively, I believe it is the best choice out there. This coffee is pure Arabica beans, lots of body without the bitterness.<br />I have made a point of trying different types of espresso beans over the years. The trend tends to be towards over-roasted beans with bitter after-tastes, and this coffee avoids it. It is plenty strong, but roasted perfectly for espresso use, and avoids the bitterness. I don't like to add sugar to my coffee and this bean with a hint of sweet finish works great. It is also not too oily which keeps the machine internals happy.<br />When you order it with automatic subscription on Amazon, it is also an unbeatable deal. Perfect."
08	64338,B001EO5YAC,A37E6W8H3ZWMDG,7/12/08,0,0,5,Excellent Italian coffee,This is a very god coffee. No comparison to domestic brands. Of course for those who can appreciate the difference.
08	64339,B001EO5YAC,A3SBLODEC0JREU,6/13/08,0,0,5,"Tried many, but always come back...","For those on the fence regarding whether or not to try this, I add my ""nod"" to the rest.  We use a super-automatic and every cup is perfect with this bean.  We are not purists, but we like what we like...  I just subscribed for the ongoing shipments and am so glad to have all of the shopping around behind me."

So I am HAPPY that Amazon has come to the rescue. The garlic taste is subtle. Cooks up well. JUst wish that it could be pruchased by the bag and not the case.It's a must try."
08	64340,B001EO5YAC,A2DK859MMN6DXI,5/27/08,0,0,4,Back to Italia,It was wonderful to find these coffee beans; we've been looking for them since we returned from our trip to Italia.

08	46066,B001EO5QZK,A1LZJZIHUPLDV4,10/22/08,2,2,5,Vegan Organic Kosher Choice,"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Very smooth taste. Medium dark color. Great tea and brand. Economical. Assam can be a wonderful place to visit when calm. Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand.

Its a great bean but you need to have the coffee is vacuum sealed, this ensures the taste is fresh. 4 out of 5 shipments the bags have pin holes allowing air to spoil the beans. l will not be buying from this vendor again."
08	64347,B001EO5YAC,AEVYHLH3NAWYN,3/31/08,3,15,3,BEANS: they are not yet GROUND,"I have loved Lavazza Oro since learning to love caffe espresso in the late 1970's while attending Bologna Medical School. I purchased these because I got tired of hauling the ground Lavazza packs in from Italy and the price was good BUT did not notice that they are BEANS not yet ground. I don't have the time or inclination to grind them myself. Still a great coffee. As the late Nino Manfredi used to say in a series of TV ads at the time in what seemed to be a double play on words: ""Piu lo butti giu, piu ti tira su."" meaning ""The more you drink the more it picks you up!"" This was in the days before Viagra but the lecherous look in his eyes communicated the meaning well."

It has the cleanest taste and overall, is a good value.  Mixing is a little tricky, but the results are worth the extra care.  I use this mostly in hot beverages, smoothies, and sauces--using a mini measuring spoon I found on e(bay)--dash, pinch, smidge, etc."

Never thought I'd ever say anything bad about 'The Chef'. Strange as it seems to me, I guess I've never had the spaghetti and meatballs before. The two little meatballs in each of these almost childsize portions are fine. But the too little spaghetti and way too much sauce are really bland.<br /><br />It takes two bowls of this to make a meal, and I'm not a big eater. And even amendments (e.g. fresh pepper) don't do much.<br /><br />And ... don't get me started on those silly microwave bowls. I don't like a mess at home and can't imagine trying to microwave and then eat this in an office setting. Maybe, just maybe, it would work if the same amount of food was in a bigger bowl ... but you've still got the splashy lid(s) to deal with.<br /><br />All in all I'll stick with canned Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli or even lasagna unless those old fashioned cans suddenly disappear!"

They're fast for the kids to heat and have a hot meal, but if you're packing them for your husband, you might toss in two of these or include a sandwich.  They're not huge, about 3/4 cup in size, so that's not that much for a manly appetite.  They're really good too, surprisingly enough, and the value for the money is nice.  Not too salty either, like soup has been lately.  And honestly, with the cost of soup these days, this stuff fills you up more and costs the same. Recommend!"

I fixed one for my starving 17 year old the other day and he ate it because he was very hungry and cranky and walking out the door, but he said it tasted like spaghetti in Campbell's tomato soup, and the meatballs are not very good.<br /><br />3rd:  I suspect these taste like Chef Boyardee (think Spaghetti-O's) so if you like that, you will probably be very happy with these.  They heat quickly and efficiently, and I think they would be an excellent lunch if you like the taste; I'm a teacher and I can see how valuable they would be on a 30 minute lunch break with a shared microwave.  I just don't like the sweet Chef Boyardee taste anymore..."

I have tried them myself and they are delicious. Just open and pop them in the microwave. It is very easy. The best thing about ordering from Amazon grocery is that they deliver to your door. If you have a loved one that lives far away and may have limited transportation this is the answer. Just order what you want them to have and Amazon takes care of the rest.

So I thought, what should I do?  Luckily, Amazon came through for me, I found this brand while googling on Amazon,,,,and gave it a whirl, Well, it came in today and it's yummy,  No complaints,  This will fit the bill just fine,  I am not sure if it is raw, but it is coldpressed,  And it tastes healthy,  Hurray!

08	19194,B001E5E20O,A1MKS4PE04FC3Q,10/27/08,2,3,3,"Bright-eyed bergamot, packed for freshness.","While not the finest Earl Grey out there, it sure is packaged for maximum appeal.  The petite cylindrical canister  is sized just right for glorified-spice-rack tea cabinet storage, with artwork that's just short of overwrought. Pop off the top, and lo: it's double-hulled, requiring an extra bit of effort for each pot brewed.  Special!  This second satisfying-pop comes complete with a wallop of sharp, nose-tingling bergamot.<br />Regular tea drinkers may find Rishi's Earl Grey most suitable as garnish to a darker, fuller-bodied tea (a couple of spoons on top of some PG Tips makes for a nice afternoon pick-me-up). Otherwise they may find they go through a can a week, at best.<br /><br />Alone, this tea brews to an orangeish hue, no darker, and always tastes slightly understeeped, or overmilked.  I tried to oversteep, but no dice: It's as if the tea's been neutered, the merest hint of tannin erased. It's unnerving.<br /><br />If you want a tea that will pretty much always present pretty well, and are willing to pay extra for that pritnear peace of mind, Rishi's Earl Grey is a good bet.  If you like more involvement with your tea -- attention to leaf volume, water temperature, steeping time, ratio of additives, etc. -- stick with Twinings, Numi, or Taylors of Harrogate."

If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor!  They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)!  I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy!  You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh and delicious.  To keep them this way, I put them in two ""Freezer Bags"" and of course, I kept some out.  Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK.  I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound!  And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag!  That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal!  I will definitely be ordering more and different kinds.  We all have our favorites!"

The tea (the leaves as well as the tea itself) has to look good, smell good, and overall present itself as something of great refinement.  No Japanese would offer another person tea that was less than wonderful, except maybe at the office.<br /><br />If the eyes are the window to the soul for Americans, the tea a person serves is the window to the soul of Japanese people.<br /><br />So my real expectation was that my wife would open up the canister, maybe try some herself once, and it just wouldn't pass enough to serve to anyone else.  Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />She opened it up with her friend, who is also from Japan, with the disclaimer that I got it from Amazon.  Clever Japanese strategy.  If it was coffee, I'd be offended as coffee is my thing, but tea is alright.<br /><br />They loved it right away.  They said, ""Come here.  Smell this.  It's a wonderful aroma.""  They added a few obligatory potential criticisms like, ""This isn't from Japan I suppose.""  And then they drank it.<br /><br />You have to understand, these two ladies drink nothing but the best.  It has to be great or they wont serve it.<br /><br />My wife has served me this tea every day since.  It's that good."

The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!"

Comparied to plain brown rice that I buy at the store (Mahatma) this mix has three times the fiber per serving.  And lastly the cooking directions on my bag differ slightly from the directions here at Amazon - the bag does not say to rinse first (so I don't), and the bag says to cover AFTER you have brought to a boil and reduced the heat.

I did not have too much of an expectation.  The popcorn is very flavorful and not overly greasy, buttery or salty.  The kernels pop a very bright fluffy white.  I also noticed that the design and material of the bag is quite different and this probably played a part in preventing the burning that I had experienced in so many other brands of microwave popcorn.  I also did not get a large number of unpopped kernels.  There were some partially popped kernels - but those are my favorite b/c they are so crunchy."

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

Your kids will love it.,"Being gluten free can be a challange to find products that can be fun to eat not just a substitute that reminds you that you are being deprived of what everyone else eats. So far, (and I have tried several) Tinkyada is the only GF pasta that I have found that is close in texture and fun as wheat spaghetti and I am including other pasta shapes in this review. My husband even likes it and I have served GF pasta with chicken and sauce over it to guests and they were suprised it was GF. It doesn't bloat you like wheat pasta. You just feel comforatbly full after a big wad of ""sketti"". One downside of any of the GF pastas is that they are stiff and breakable when cold so it is hard to use them for cold pasta salad. However, I had some that I had overcooked a little and that seemed to work pretty well for cold salad. You will have to experiment for yourself with that. At any rate, I would definitely suggest you try the spaghetti especially if you have a child who is gluten free. Also the pasta will make great mac and cheese."

The only drawback here is that it does take it about 45 minutes or longer to cook fully in the oven. I usually boil mine for a little bit to cut down on the cooking time in the oven. This pasta is really great about not falling apart while cooking or handling which is a huge plus. Love it - a must have for the gluten-free!

Too bad there's NO MEAT inside! Mince pie (or mincemeat pies) are a traditional festive British sweet pastry, usually consumed during the Christmas and New Year period. Mince Pies normally have a pastry top, but versions may also be found without the top in which case they are known as a mince tart.<br /><br />The name 'mincemeat' comes from the original recipe. Up to the Victorian era the mince(meat) pie would actually have been a spiced meat pie with some dried fruit. Today the only remnant of the original meat is (sometimes) the inclusion of suet. Typically fillings today consist entirely of fruit-based mincemeat containing dried fruit such as raisins, currants, glace cherries, apricot, candied peel; spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg; nuts such as walnuts or chopped almonds; suet; and some kind of alcohol, usually either brandy or rum.<br /><br />Walkers Mince pies are suitable for vegetarians because the suet is replaced by vegetable oil. The pie is often finished off with a delicate dusting of either castor sugar or icing sugar on top."

When they mention that this product has a ""bergamot citrus"" aroma, they surely don't mess around. It indeed packs a nice, powerful punch. Upon opening it, I almost had to catch my breath. My grandmother could even smell it across the room. Very delightful and very strong in its flavor and fragrance. This tea is powerful enough in strength to where it eliminates the need to use a lot of leaves. I feel that it will last me for quite some time. When you add the fact that it's kosher, fair trade, and USDA certified organic, I feel all the more better about it."

But I was attracted to the idea of this tea: a Fair Trade product, totally organic, described as ""bold and sweetly smooth,"" and I wanted to give it a try. Once I had opened the lid (double lid, actually) on the neat looking can and saw the incredibly dark and aromatic leaves, I knew I wanted this all to myself. True to its promise this Earl Grey tea is delicious. A strong tea, a smooth tea, no bitterness (my usual complaint about tea in general), and really does not need the addition of lemon, milk or sweetener - as a matter of fact, I think that would hide some of the more nuanced flavors I tasted here. I will definitely keep a can of this on hand for myself..... and I may even buy one for my sister."

08	19187,B001E5E20O,A1XDMYX8QOW07N,10/21/08,1,1,5,An Excellent Tea,"Not all Earl Grey teas are created equal. Because the bergamot oil can mask a less than stellar leaf, many tea companies do not use really high quality tea leaves for their Earl Grey.<br /><br />Rishi uses a solid leaf from Yunnan for their Earl Grey, a hearty black tea which comes from the same region as Puerh tea comes from. As a result you can easily get 2 full steeping from these leaves.<br /><br />The tea has a nice balanced flavor, the bergamot isn't overpowering and it compliments the sweetness of the Yunnan tea. Prior to the Rishi I was purchasing Mighty Leaf's Earl Grey and I have to say that I prefer the Rishi. It all boils down to the choice of tea leaves (which should seem obvious) but Rishi's choice and the price point of this tea make it THE Earl Grey to beat!"

Now, I buy this tea in whatever store I can buy it and whenever I can get it.  The fragrance of this tea is almost overwhelming.  I blend it with an Earl Grey and pour it over ice.  Although I do not sweeten tea, many people do, but I don't think anyone will need sweetener.  If they do, only a touch of honey.<br /><br />I like a ""floral"" taste, so if you do, you'll love this.  It is definitely worth spending the money to try.  Even the teabags are pretty...IMHO, they should be steeped in a clear, glass container."

Heavily marketed and very popular, it is the official drink for the NFL, NBA and MLB and other major sports organization. It is an engineered drink to help rehydrate and replenish fluid during heavy physical activities.<br /><br />This powdered form is a more economical way of drinking Gatorade. Make sure you shake it enough to dissolve the mix. The taste is very similar to the bottled.<br /><br />I was introduced to Gatorade about 15 years ago when I played tennis with my cousin in Hawaii. I loved it especially the taste that is not so sweet as compared to other drinks. A very hot day and a ice cold Gatorade is just the perfect combination. It is very refreshing.<br /><br />Just a bit of a caution. Our family dentist warns us not to drink Gatorade on a casual basis. It is even worse than sodas when it comes to your the teeth.

The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

Although the package<br />directions suggest NOT to boil the water, but to pour it just below<br />boiling, I have tried it both ways -- and find that, like other<br />instants, JACOBS CRONAT GOLD INSTANT COFFEE suits my own tastes bet-<br />ter, if the water is boiled a LONGER time...the longer, the better!<br /><br />Tastes do differ -- and I find I, myself, like a deeper, more robust<br />brew.  However, if the water for this instant coffee is boiled LONG<br />enough, I find that a wonderful hint of strength is brought forth<br />amongst the mild taste, giving it a unique and delightful flavour,<br />which I have found, so far, in NO other instant coffee!<br /><br />  COFFEE....INSTANT....COFFEE<br /><br />The jar this coffee comes in is pleasing indeed!  Made of VERY heavy<br />glass,, I found that, (ordering four at a time to save on postage),<br />that the unopened package could easily be used as a doorstop!  The<br />""crown""-like cover is easy to open -- in a seemingly-circular, (but<br />actually fifteen-sided figure), design. Those 15 sides make it VERY<br />easy to open!<br /><br />On the two sides of the golden label, are printed directions for<br />use -- in NINE languages!  I can read the English, (UK) directions,<br />and recognize, (I think), the lettering for the Russian, (MK) -- or<br />is it Greek -- directions, though I cannot read them.  The other<br />directions -- for ""AL""; ""HR/BiH""; ""SRB..(Serbia?) / MNE""; and ""SI"",<br />are in languages I do not know.  It's fascinating to look at this<br />label, however -- because it confirms my suspicions that Americans<br />are woefully under-educated, as I, (who was educated in District 26<br />in Queens, New York -- reputedly one of the best public school<br />districts in New York City, and in Queens College of the City of<br />New York, (which also has a sterling reputation), could recognize<br />but two of these languages!  I also noted -- with some alarm -- that<br />FRENCH does NOT seem to be one of the nine languages used for these<br />directions!  Maybe it IS there, and I have had too many years pass<br />between college French classes and now....but if it ISN'T there, the<br />manufacturers of this coffee are MISSING a market which will NOT<br />accept ANY merchandise of ANY kind, without FRENCH instructions<br />being given on the packaging: QUEBEC, CANADA!  (This includes EVERY<br />imaginable  product: in the infamous ""Matzo-gate"" of several years<br />back, the government of Quebec would not even allow Matzo to be<br />imported into Quebec, for Jews celebrating Passover, because there<br />was NO FRENCH LETTERING on the boxes!)  This is all the more aston-<br />ishing to me, as it seems that the JACOBS Coffee Company has now<br />become a subsidiary of the KRAFT FOODS CORPORATION (!) -- a very<br />large food company, which should be aware of the Quebec law!  (Or<br />perhaps they are just too busy producing yummy food to have re-<br />membered this?)  Anyway, I happen to have relatives in Quebec --<br />so I KNOW this Quebec law -- of having FRENCH language directions<br />included on EVERYTHING, is true.  So, if KRAFT, and JACOBS, want<br />to sell this coffee to the Quebec, Canada market, I respectfully<br />request they include FRENCH directions on the packaging!<br /><br />Altogether, this is a delicious instant coffee -- especially if<br />you like MILD instant coffee.

It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk."

While I have had many loose teas that come in tins, I do appreciate that under the outer cap, this tin has an additional metal stopper that is very easily removed but also prevents an explosion of tea leaves.<br /><br />The stopper not only serves as a seal, it is also useful in measuring the tea for brewing- this little inner stopper holds approximately 1 Tablespoon of tea (not packed, fairly loose...I measured it as I was curious...) which is the recommended amount for 8oz of water and proper brewing... Many folks do not like tea because they have not had properly brewed tea, so this is an impressive extra measure to ensure the brew is as intended...<br /><br />When you open the container the bergamot hits you in the face...I was hoping the overwhelming bergamot would settle down during the brew, but I still found that it was overwhelming to the point of being excessively perfumey (for me it was like being trapped in a small space with someone who bathed in a bottle of eau de anything)... It was quite drinkable when I attempted to get past the bergamot slap, and the Yunnan black tea was smooth and rich and delightful...Not bitter in the least, and very flavorful and tasty... Unfortunately, I could not get past the overwhelming bergamot... But I plan on trying some of Rishi Tea's other varieties as I do like this varietal of Yunnan black tea...<br /><br />I do also appreciate that this is USDA organic, Fair Trade certified and the tin tells the story of the tea and the people who cultivate it...<br /><br />I prefer my Earl Grey to be more balanced, with the tea aspect or the bergamot in harmony...."

I bought this at Whole Foods, but I think I'll buy it from Amazon from now on because it's almost half the price.<br /><br />I tasted this before dumping it in his coffee, and it tastes wonderful.  One of the other reviewers mentioned a ""cooling"" sensation - it does taste like you're eating something cold, even though it's room temperature.  It's kind of like mint in that way, but not mint-flavored.  I put a little in my own coffee (usually I prefer coffee black, but I'm testing it for this review) and it didn't give the nasty aftertaste that ""pink"" (saccharine), ""blue"" (nutrisweet), or even ""yellow"" (splenda) gives.  I also don't have a headache, which I get from ""yellow"", but then I didn't put much in my coffee - maybe a teaspoonfull.<br /><br />I'm nervous about health issues, but since this is made from fermented cane sugar, I can't think of any health issues that this would have, as opposed to saccharine.  I looked it up in Wikipedia, and the article on ""erythritol"" is informative and nerve-calming.  You should read the article if you're curious, but apparently erythritol (which this product is) is safe, has almost no side effects (like gas or bloating) unless taken in HUGE quantities, and is even safe for your teeth.  It also mentions the ""cooling effect""."

I'm Hoping the price will go down some.  Not as sweet as sugar, but it has all the same texture and crunch. Try it, I think you will be suprised."

They're vegan, preservative free, and have only a half gram of monounsaturated fat each.  My only issue is that the calories are a bit high and the nutrients a bit low.  Each (appx) 5x3"" cracker is 70 calories and has only 2 grams of fiber.  Aside from phosphorous and magnesium (6 and 4% RDA respectively) the only health benefit is 2 grams each of protein and iron.  For a cracker, they are pretty filling but it's still easy to go through a LOT of calories in a short time.  With a thick, no-sugar spread a couple of these would probably suffice for a heavy breakfast or light lunch."

08	73820,B001ELLA58,A3MILDAIBVX6WM,4/1/08,3,4,3,Pretty good flax crackers,"I really wanted to enjoy these flax crackers. I like the fact they are organic, raw (dehydrated at low temp), etc. They are a healthy snack food, although they are difficult to eat without plenty of liquids (they kinda congeal/clump in mouth, making it hard to swallow). That having been said, they are simply overpriced. If you have a dehydrator tray or some ingenuity, you can save 90% (a pound of organic flax is about 2$). I prefer the Foods Alive brand instead, if one absolutely must buy pre-made flax crackers (Their mexican flavored are very good, and do not contain liquid aminos (soy), like this brand does, for those who avoid it)"

Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this ""red apple"" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this ""red apple"" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD."

Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT."

At last, I had discovered something useful and affordable to give as gifts to loved ones who had ""everything"".  After scouring the website, I eventually chose this brand because of the price.  However, my in laws claim that it is ""very good"" indeed so the low price is an added bonus.  They have been thrilled with a neverending supply of the beverage since we can ""afford"" to send them the tea in our care packages that go out every few weeks."

Remember, these almonds are flavored with natural dark chocolate which is an anti-oxidant. All in all, I don't think you can find a healthier snack. They're great! I will say that a four pack is not nearly enough if you have a family. The kids love them as well and tend to eat them like popcorn. One word - ""YUM!"""
08	49913,B00430B73W,AJLOYR7SHJPVG,3/25/08,30,30,4,Best overall organic bar,"I've tried most of the organic bars on the market to date. I consider the ""Organic Food Bar""  brand to be the gold standard, and I've enjoyed them for years. The Raw Revolution bars are proving to be just as good, and they are considerably cheaper. At the moment, Amazon is tied for the cheapest price I've seen for Organic Food Bars: 0.97 cents/ounce.<br />Amazon has the cheapest price I've seen for Raw Revolution bars: 0.60 cents/ounce! That is over a 30% difference. Its 1.31 for a 2.2 oz bar. Retail is 1.99/bar; and that is what they are on the Raw Revolution website, too.<br /><br />I love the taste; it had not occurred to me that some folks wouldn't like them until I read some of the reviews here. Then again, it is easy for me to learn to like foods that are healthy. Both of these bar lines seem high in fat to me (my dieting Mom won't eat them), but it is all healthy fat. I would like to see more of a Zone diet ratio (more protein).  They could have a bit less sweet for my taste, but that goes for every bar I've ever tried.<br /><br />Its funny (and makes so much sense) that Raw Revolution has so many chocolate flavors. Also, the Raw Revolution folks I met at the Outdoor Retailer show were some of the nicest folks; very liberal with their samples, too ;-).<br /><br />I wish that health food stores (and online merchants) would post the price per ounce for the plethora of bars that are out there. Maybe they don't want to draw attention to how expensive many of these products are! I am very resistant to paying over a dollar an ounce for bars, especially when these all organic, high quality bars are less than that.<br /><br />So the dollar an ounce limit for a 2.4 ounce bar is $2.40; for a 2.2 ounce bar it is $2.20, and so forth.<br /><br />For good bars that are only .41/ounce on Amazon, you can't beat Clif bars, 70% organic; a good staple. Probably the healthiest food at 7-11, if you're hungry and stuck. Clif Builder bars (chocolate) are good too; more of a ""normal"" chocolate crunchy bar.<br />Cheers!<br />Wasatch Bill"

Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

Awesome stuff. You'll only be sorry when they are gone and you have eaten too much.

The flour is fine and costs $1.99 but the postage cost was $7.50! That is really too much compared to the cost of the product.

Thankfully, Emerald made these for adult palates, but kids seem to like them too.  The subtle chocolate flavor is wonderful.  The chocolate is roasted onto the almonds and is dry to the touch.  Can't melt and create a mess as milk chocolate does.  A box of 4 canisters didn't last as long as I thought they would.  Amazon has apparently has sold out!  Arghhh!  Do me a favor and buy 300 calorie chocolate bars and leave more of these for me!"

Having lived abroad, I have become accustomed to brewing loose tea, as well as using tea bags.  I love this tea so much that I only brewed it once in a while as a special treat, so as not to use it up all at once.  I wish it was decaffeinated, but other than that, it is truly enjoyable.  Because I like a weaker tea, I only use maybe less than a teaspoon per pot.  The aroma is great also.  The fact that this tea is organic is a bonus."

I gasped when I first sipped this drink. There is a strange saltiness in the taste and the passion fruit and orange peel are barely perceivable.<br /><br />Amazon was kind enough to refund me the cost of this order. Lesson to be learned: try to find a sample of a product before you buy a case of it.

When you brew this tea my fiance and I actually said ""WHOA!"" out loud.  The leafs are perfect size and makes brewing it very easy.<br /><br />IMO I would classify this tea as a winter tea as when I drink it I just wish snow was falling and I am drinking my tea to warm up. :)<br /><br />I cant give it 5 star mainly because of how fast and dark this tea stains our cups.  You have to make sure you clean your cups right away or else this tea will stain, A LOT.  I accidentally spilled some tea on our floor, and it actually stained the floor :(  Of course this would be considered User Error and the draw back of using an actual organic good tea, but now I have to make sure I can find the cups that have already been stained so I dont stain any more.<br /><br />Overall: Get it. I will make sure I always have one in the house."

This Rishi Earl Grey is very nice, not overly heavy with no licorice undertones that I really find unappealing in some Earl Gery varieties. The tea takes four minutes to steep, and when done is quite aromatic. I would recommend this one without reservation.<br /><br />*****Update 10-10-2009*****<br /><br />I had to come update this review to express how much I LOVE this tea. It's easily one of the most enjoyable teas I've experienced (I'm drinking a cup of it as I update this review) and it always makes me happy when I brew a cup. This is a lovely tea!"

We tried goat's milk to no avail and have finally happily settled on Rice Dream Enriched Original. She loves it and Even I like the taste. It's a little sweet and she picked it right up after a year of breastfeeding. With the addition of a multivitamin each day, my pediatrician has approved it's use.<br /><br />We purchase the 64 ounce size for $3.24 at a local store (about $0.05 an ounce.) I came online to look for a better price when purchasing in bulk. The price for these small 8 ounce containers is $0.16 per ounce and causes MUCH more packaging waste. I appreciate the convenience of having it in a small package for dining out, etc... but It's just as easy to take an insulated sippy cup and be more environmentally conscious.<br /><br />The Rice Dream Website sells the 32 ounce size but their price is $0.10 an ounce, without shipping costs. Not much advantage to purchasing online so far. I was hoping that Amazon would have a decent cost on the larger sizes with free super saving shipping, because I could stop shopping at Wal-Mart entirely.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon to request that they carry the larger 64 ounce size in cases. The first time I called, the Customer Service Rep<br />s computer locked up and she requested that I call her back. The second time I called I was told to leave feedback on the product and that all feedback is read by Amazon and that it could make a difference and might increase the chance that the product would be carried in a larger size, due to demand."

They will taste a lot like chocolate if you eat them right - put them in your mouth, let the chocolate mix with your mouth juices, then start eating the almond.  Crunch crunch yum yum.  If you're used to a sugar-and-dairy loaded almond, you probably eat too fast anyway - no wonder we're all so fat!  Slow down and enjoy it, they really are great!<br /><br />Ben"

It seemed like two flavors that did not blend.  These seemed a halfway measure of dipping in chocolate and eating the almonds straight.  I would prefer either of those ways to these.  I was left with the impression of diet food - not quite what you really want, but a poor substitution."

It actually tastes like dirt.<br />(I guess what I mean is that it TASTES the way dirt SMELLS.)<br /><br />Except for the dirt that I've actually eaten and it does taste a lot like that.<br />Nah, it just needs something.<br />Like honey or some other sweetener and then it's pretty good.<br />Then it tastes like SWEET dirt.<br />I swear I'm not trying to be funny.  It's just an interesting flavor.<br />I have steeped it several different ways (sometimes with another flavor of tea) for variety.<br />Like I said, now that I'm 'used' to it, it's actually pretty good.

The tin aroma was a 'bright' citrus as opposed the the usual 'darker, earthier' citrus I have encountered with other Earl Greys. I don't know if it's a different strain of bergamot, if it's processed differently, but the nose is almost tangerine-like in its brightness.<br /><br />The nose translates well to the flavor, though the bergamot difference is less obvious here.  I found the balance to be good, though I've noticed that it seems to get unusually tannic/bitter with just slight oversteeping,(so watch that brew time closely.)<br /><br />I think I'm going to have to investigate more of Rishi's products.<br /><br />Recommended"

They are incredibly tasty, easy to make using hot water from the coffee machine, organic and wholesome.  I bring along some crackers or bread from home to round out my lunch.  I have also tried the tomato soup, mac and cheese and chili mac.  All are highly recommended for the taste, for the ease of preparation and the fact that you are eating organic at your desk!  The potato soup is my favorite, but all the varieties I have found have been great.  It is so much better than eating from the office cafeteria - cheaper and far better for you.  We eat organic at home and it is great to find a product I can have at the office that is organic as well and that I can have on the spur of the moment.

Trust me, if you put just a little time into showing your dog how it ""works"", it will easily become its favorite toy. The BEST!!!!!!"

Also good if you're needing to satisfy a craving but not wanting to go overboard on dessert. The chocolate are good too. I'm a chocolate lover but i actually prefer these vanilla. Amazon's price is pretty decent even compared w walmart. and w free shipping i can stock up and not have to run to store if i run out."

I don't eat a lot at one time, but it wasn't that filling.  Maybe with a piece of fruit and a drink it could be breakfast. (Honestly, I prefer the chocolate peanut butter bars from South Beach Living--awesome).<br /><br />Anyway, this vanilla crisp cereal bar is 90 calories, 2g protein, 10% niacin, thiamin, vitamin B6, and riboflavin (again, compare it to the South Beach Living Peanut Butter Chocolate bar). The vanilla crisp bar is tasty, a little sweet but not too bad, and crunchy like a rice krispy bar. It has a drizzle of what tastes like white icing on top. It's a lot better than many of these bars.<br /><br />If you are eating these as a low-cal snack or to have something in the car to keep your sugar count from blitzing out, then ok, sure.  But if you are doing a diet thing, you need to have a satisfying meal experience. If you feel ""cheated"" out of breakfast, you are likely to go off your diet.  Most diet gurus tell you to eat 3 - 6 reasonable and satisfying meals a day. And as someone who lost 59 lbs 1-2 years ago, I agree.<br /><br />By the way--bars contain wheat, milk, and soy ingredients. (I know some people are allergic to these ingredients.)"

Instead of the treats they suggest (which could be made of anything and could have too many calories), I fill these with Cheerio's (or some frozen sliced carrrots or peas) and a few larger milkbones and they go nuts.  The larger milkbones are added just to make it a little tougher.  It's a great learning toy or busy toy - hence the name.  All I have to ask my little Puggies is, ""do you want your bottle"" and that's all they need.  We couldn't live without it.

One of them figured out how to get the treats out within a matter of minutes ... her father hasn't quite gotten it yet.  For him, it's still trial and error, but they both love it.  I like that it is so easy to fill; the bottom simply screws off so you have easy access for filling and cleaning.  It's easy to clean too; I've washed it in the dishwasher with no problems.  My dogs have destroyed several other treat-dispensing toys by simply chewing through the toy to get to the treats.  I've had this one for a few weeks now and it's still in good shape (only a few scratches on the surface of the jug from being bounced around my hardwood floors).

I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good.  I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing.  The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter.  It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).<br /><br />Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off.  Not Recommended."

I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture. I dislike soft mushy cookies although if desperate...but I know that ""snap"" cookies are usually not soft so I took a chance and ordered a case!  I live alone so a case of cookies was, at once, both frightening and decadent---but I think I am going to have to order another case!  Everyone who tasted these asked me ""so where did you find these?""  Of course, since I am the online shopper from hell, everyone figured I found some obscure website and paid a fortune. ""Natural"" and ""Organic"" are buzz words for ""gonna cost ya more"" but the price was great per bag. After I told my friends and family who tasted them that I ordered a case---the bags started disappearing pretty fast! I got hit with guilt---What are YOU going to do with 12 bags of cookies? (duh--eat them!) and everyone was very happy to lighten up my stash by taking a bag so I dont overeat! Dont I have the BEST friends and family??? LOL  Seriously--I was happy to hand them over! I enjoy turning people on to new finds. I gave a bag to my Parcel Post guy and my UPS guy (after all--they lug all the boxes to my apartment!) and they were happy! And there is a method to my giving-away madness (especially to the carriers)! Less dropping and throwing around of MY boxes!<br /><br />Ok--they are nice and lemoney (?) but they could even be a bit more lemon-like for me! They are made with more healthful ingredients (no trans-fat) so even though I am pigging out on cookies--I dont feel nearly as guilty! And at less than $2 a bag--I think they are a greal deal! Plus it never hurts to have extra cookies in the house because a cookie emergency can happen at any given moment!  So--order them!  I think you will be pleased!"

We like a crisp ginger snap, and while the bag isn't self-sealing it seals well if you have a clip. We find the ginger level to be just right -- not overpowering, but definitely there.<br /><br />One correction to the ingredient list posted on this site -- there's no grape juice concentrate in the cookie, according to the bag I'm looking at right now and the Mi-Del website.<br /><br />Per serving size of 5 cookies: Calories 140; Total Fat 4g; Carbs 22g; Fiber 1g; Sugars 11g."

They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems. The ingredients are mostly organic and they are sweetened with dehydrated can juice, as opposed to the less-healthy commercial alternatives.<br /><br />Now, for the problem: I have never found these cookies in a market near me, and we have only purchased them through Amazon. Because these wonderful cookies are not pumped-up with weird chemical preservatives, the necessity of purchasing them in such big lots means that you are going to be eating a lot of cookies in a short period of time, or going in with a friend on sharing the case!

Subtle, crunchy, delicious.","I think what I had in mind when we opened the canister was either the soft chocolate layer you might find in Raisinets, or the layer covered by a shell in M&Ms.  Instead, we found almonds that had just been powder coated in a fine layer of cocoa.  We found this a positive, in the sense that we could see the size and quality of the nuts, and that they took the center stage, with the cocoa as a subtle backdrop.<br /><br />I am not a chocolate fan, but loved these.  The cocoa is a secondary taste layer that doesn't build cumulatively the more of these you eat.  The end result is a terrific almond snacking option, with enough variation from other approaches to keep your taste buds thinking.  The almonds are crisp and of high quality.  Emerald has done a fantastic job of selecting premium quality, enough so that even Alton Brown might consider going back on his rule of only buying nuts in clear containers that you can see.<br /><br />With reasonable evidence to suggest that almonds represent some measure of improvement to cholesterol health, we can even toss a few of these back relatively guilt-free.  Will be buying again."

The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.

My minpin Hudson is very picky about his food but he ran into the kitchen as soon as i opened the can. I mix a little in with his dry dog food and he devours it.  i was suprised when i first opened the can because it looked watery and there were whole chicken wings with bones and all not what your accustume to when you open a can of dog food. However, the chicken wings fall apart easily and are very soft the bones literally turn to mush. It looks like whole chicken wings in gravy that have cooked in the crock pot allday and it smells wonderful.  I have tried other high quality brands and he would quit eating them after a day or two.  He eats this every time and it looks like homemade food that I would eat. His coat is glistening and soft and he has great energy. I can't wait to try the other flavors I'll let you know if he likes them. I'm going to switch his dry food to merrick when his Inova is gone."

The Healthy Maturity formula has all the nutrition needed for healthy joints which has slowed her down lately. I think this dog food has helped her to get along better than before we started it. Since it is loaded with salmon/fish oil, it has a rather potent smell and has made the dog very 'gassy' if you know what I mean. Of course my kids think it is funnier than anything on TV.<br />As for the price $18.99, that is outrageous. You can get this for under $11 at Walmart and Kmart."

08	18245,B000MMAZD8,A3BYZGND268JXO,6/27/08,6,6,5,Unparalleled Taste & Quality,"I've always liked Grape Juice- I didn't have it often, but liked white grape juice best, tending to prefer extremely sweet things. White grape juice & apple juice are near-universal bases for juice-blends, as they're bland & cheap to produce. Reading about their high sugar content & relative lack of vitality/food value, especially in comparison with heart-nurturing purple grape juice/wines, I decided to try darker juices.<br /><br />Welch's Concord Grape Juice was nice; Juicy Juice was OK; generic juices were generally not bad, tho of course they might not actually be juice but re-confabulations of concentrates plus high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). I've noticed over the past few years that HFCS tends to make me feel draggy; more recently, high fructose corn syrup's been implicated in our nation's widespread obesity, no pun intended.  ""Great, thanks, now ya tell me""... at least I know now!<br /><br />Kedem Concord was available at my local warehouse store, price comparable with other juices, and a label check said it was made of Concord grapes, with some Concord grape concentrate, no HFCS. With one swallow, it was clear to me that this product was distinctly superior in flavor, texture, non-obtrusive sweetness and tartness, and bloomin' wholesomeness than any other grape juice I've ever had. It has body, a velvet touch to the tongue, and many more dimensions than just one jolt of flavor. It's a genuine food, not a slug of sugar & color & liquid as currently so many so-called juices are, like a pre-mixed kool-aid that needs refrigeration.<br /><br />I'm far from wealthy & rarely buy treats (yep, even with the obesity!), especially juice, since actual fruit's better for me: more complete, cheaper, etc.  I am regularly buying Kedem Concord grape juice though.  Balancing dollars & quality, after again running my own consumer comparisons with other purple+/or concord grape juices, Kedem's still got it far, far over the other drinks available to me. I truly wonder what on earth could account for such a vivid difference.<br /><br />I still hate spending the money- it's good when cut half-& half with cheap raspberry lime seltzer, good mixed with other fresh & store-bought juices, good in cereal instead of milk (OK, an acquired taste, but I don't drink milk well), great mixed with nutritional (nicer than brewer's) yeast.<br /><br />I do have to include a caveat, tho, as it's preserved with Potassium Metabisulfite, which some might have reactions to, esp. asthmatics like myself. Man, am I fortunate NOT to have experienced any reaction to the Kedem Concord Grape Juice that I like so much!<br /><br />Yep- I likes it! And I whole-heartedly recommend it!"

I have been using this matcha for over 6 months now and while it is a little more expensive than most, it is the best that I have tried. The best thing is that it is the best way to get your green tea and is extremely healthy for you. Give DoMatcha a try, I think you will love it too!<br /><br />Don't forget to get a Chasen (bamboo whisk), Chashaku (bamboo scoop) and a Chawan (matcha bowl) to complete the experience."

That is, until we picked up Emerald Marcona Almonds, 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4).  It was amazing, we would give these to guests and everyone said these were pretty good. Then we'd give them some Marconas and their faces would light up and say, ""The Cocoa almonds were good, but these are very good.""<br /><br />The Cocoa nuts have a nice rich chocolate flavor and crisp nuttiness. All in all they were good, but they didn't hold a light to the Marcona nuts. Maybe Emerald should make cocoa marconas.<br /><br />Once the Marconas were gone, our six year old made fairly regular covert trips to the kitchen to grab one of these.  So they were hit with him, although since his mom horded the Marconas to herself, he didn't know what he was missing.<br /><br />Definitely was a five star product before Marconas."

The seasonings enhance this already highly-esteemed nut.  The ground sea salt and pepper is generous as a topping, and the kick of pepper combined with the saltiness covers any savory hankering.<br /><br />Its size is a boon, as it makes it easier to stow in a backpack, carry-on, or a picnic basket  It's also just enough to keep handy in your pantry for last minute guests.  I am adding this to my corral of ""What's easy to put out and look really put together?""<br /><br />This is a keeper."

The taste is ok because I add peanut butter to them.  I liked them better before they changed the recipe.  As long as they keep the 3 grams of fiber I will keep buying.  I feel they are the best of what's available.  Make sure you check the date when purchasing because they have no preservatives they get rancid quickly.
08	73414,B000EPOC28,A2XZ0BB4727YZU,2/7/08,0,0,5,Not Supposed to be normal.,"These grahams are beautiful.  They are simple, slightly sweet, subtly healthy and a delicious supplement to their hydrogenated counterparts.  I would choose these grahams over any other ""natural"" graham on the market.  It is sweetened with honey and molasses only, so no refined sugars or evaporated sugar juice.  Warning.  These are not intended to be super sweet, they are intended to be like the original recipe for what we have come to understand as graham crackers.  Our taste for this type of food has overdeveloped into a need to have sugary snacks.  I promise you, if you compliment these with a good chunky peanut butter you will not be disappointed.  This could possibly be my favorite snack in the history of my mouth.  I truly recommend these, and if you need a little extra sweetness, top with PB and some good quality (low sugar) chocolate chips.  So, don't knock these for being unsweet.  That is the purpose and they are a great snack."

But, while I wasn't crazy about these, my 7yo dd, who is a spice fiend (loves pepper), LOVED these, as did my husband.  They both ended up taking the can over to my neighbor, who had to try them, and he told his wife to buy them, as he too now is addicted.  She already purchased 2 cans for him.

Because they are packed with salt: 230 grams of sodium (that's 9% of your recommended daily value!!) in four not-that-huge crackers. That's just silly (oh, and unhealthy).<br /><br />Years ago, these were my favorite graham crackers. Then, Mi Del reformulated them and made them oddly lemony and salty. I can not eat even one!<br /><br />There are better whole wheat crackers out there. For example, Health Valley Crackers, Graham Amaranthtaste better and are lower in sugar, not to mention sodium, too.<br /><br />P.

08	27444,B001E4S7WE,A2WRWK0ARXOFSZ,4/7/08,0,1,3,the taste,This product gets 3 stars from the taste alone. Most protein shakes taste like chalk mixed with milk. But this one has a very good taste that makes you want to drink more of it. It is high in protein o it would be a great drink to have after a rigorous workout. The biggest downfall for the product is it has a lot of sugar in it. I try to avoid a lot of sugar so this wouldn't be the drink for me.

The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself. Why did I ever buy a whole case! Bless Amazon for carrying the Bahlsen line of fabulous cookies because it is not available in Montana.

We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).<br />So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now)."
08	65409,B001EQ55ZO,A1XRXOSMIFKM0Y,7/16/08,0,0,3,My six year old likes them,"I thought they were overly salty myself, but he said he could handle it. The pepper was less intrusive but it may well have been that the salt settles during shipping or handling and one cannister may be different than another. Not sure that I would purchase on a consistent basis but they were all eaten in my hosehold."
08	65410,B001EQ55ZO,A17M1HL6U2GS7M,7/16/08,0,0,4,These are very very tasty,"We loved these.  Delicious--very tasty, remarkably addictive snacks.  I never thought that I would like to have pepper on my salted nuts...but wow--it added a real depth of flavor that I found irresistible.  Delicious."
08	65411,B001EQ55ZO,A1B4MIXYVIKMU2,7/16/08,0,0,4,Just as expected,"These sea salted and peppered Cashews would make a great snack for the guys and gals that like Cashews.  I didn't really find anything about them remarkable, but I'm not a huge fan of Cashews. Also, I'm not sure that the  salt and pepper really added to the taste... I think they would've tasted fine without the extra spices.<br /><br />The Cashews themselves did seem like they were of high quality and fresh. So if you love Cashews (or nuts in general... no pun intended) you'll probably enjoy this product.  As for me, I'm enjoying the dark chocolate powdered Almonds made from the same company... much more."

They are nicely seasoned with ample black pepper. Most pieces, however, are too salty.<br /><br />If these were slightly less salty, they'd be better."

08	65414,B001EQ55ZO,A3D9BTRM4JOU41,7/16/08,0,0,4,"Spicy, tasty snack","These are darn tasty, but subtle they're not. The ""pepper"" in the name isn't just black pepper; these nuts are hot and spicy, and very, very salty. Good with a cocktail or a cold beer, they're too powerful to eat without a drink in hand. The subtle sweetness of cashews is lost in the coating; you could make the same product out of peanuts more cheaply without really affecting the snacking experience. All in all, though, they're a good nosh, the best of the three ""Emerald"" flavors I've tried."

I could see this shake as a great option for those times. While I was only given one sample can to try, so can't attest to long term effectiveness, I can say that it is a tasty, filling shake, (it should be for 370 Calories) that would be a good option for someone to consume after working out or playing a fast paced sport."
08	65415,B001EQ55ZO,A16O0S1QROXGJM,7/16/08,0,0,4,Fairly good,"I wasn't wild about these at first, but they grew on me.  The pepper is a bit overpowering after the first few bites....it sneaks up on you.  However, after eating them several times I enjoyed them more.  My chief complaint is with the plastic packaging.  Although very convenient, it is wasteful and environmentally unfriendly.  PLEASE recycle the canisters!"
08	65416,B001EQ55ZO,AYUF7YETYOLNX,7/16/08,0,0,1,Not the nut for me,"We have picked up a number of Emerald nuts recently.  We liked Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4) and absolutely loved Emerald Marcona Almonds, 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4), but we did not care for these at all. I have no problem with the quality of the product, but I do have a problem with the recipe.<br /><br />In theory pepper and sea salt sounded like a great combination.  Salty with a slight peppery taste sounded great, but in reality, the pepper was overwhelming. Everyone in our family tried them and no one cared for them. The sea salt alone would have been good, and even a lighter coating of pepper would have been okay.<br /><br />We love Emerald nuts in general, this one just wasn't a hit with our family."

Both my dogs and my cats love the food and have been on it since they were 4 months old. My younger cat was very sick when I brought her home and I was nervous about putting her on a vegei diet until she was well. My Vet uses this product and recommended that I switch right away because it's such a high quality food. Once I put her on Evolution she had a speedy recovery. Everyone that has had contact with my pets have made comments on how beautiful their fur is.

They are packaged in handy carry-along packages, so they're great for camping, car trips, or keeping in your desk drawer.<br />That said, this is not my favorite of the group.The sodium level is high, there are equal grams of sugar and fiber (2), and the ingredients include maltodextrin, sugar, granulated onion, and flavorings. So we are at least a step away from naturally good cashews. Compared to a packet of potato chips, the Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews have more fat, more saturated fat, more sugar, fewer vitamins, and only slightly more fiber.<br />I didn't care for the taste, either, though my husband enjoyed them. They were too salty for me, and the flavor didn't seem natural.<br />They were nice as an ingredient in stir-fry, though.<br />If you want to incorporate more nuts into your snacks but really you wish you were eating barbecue chips, then this might be a transitional food for you."

08	65419,B001EQ55ZO,A1VKAY0XWLA2CY,7/15/08,0,0,3,Sea Salt and Pepper:  Too much?  Just right?  Yes and yes.,"We loved these at first.  While we thought the salt and pepper was very powerful, the cashews themselves were large and flavorful, and the whole thing really worked.  We still love them, but it's a hit-or-miss proposition.  You never quite know how your taste buds are going to react when you open the container and toss a few in your mouth.  Sometimes, without a doubt, it's just a little too overpowering.<br /><br />The quality of the cashews is fantastic, the salt and pepper adhere to the nuts surprisingly well considering how coarse it all is.  There are times when I'd rate these a 4 or even 5, others where I'd want to go as low as 2.  3 it is.<br /><br />Would we buy them again?  I don't think so, but I had to stop and really think about that.  Emerald has a great product here, and we loved their Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4), but the moments where these are too much, are enough to keep us from going back for more when this can is gone."
08	65420,B001EQ55ZO,A3JJUCA6K4P31H,7/15/08,0,0,4,Cashews.,"Well, this product is pretty self explanatory, and I'm not really sure who buys their nuts from Amazon.com, but when offered some by the Vine program in exchange, I couldn't say no (I love cashews!).  The only thing different about these cashews from your average roasted/salted cashews is the addition of black pepper.  I really did like the pepper addition, although plain salted cashews are still higher on my list.  The flavor is a bit stronger and I can only eat a few at a time.  I also think that if I ate enough of these salt and pepper nuts, I'd probably get sick of them and never want them again, so they're probably best in small doses.  Other than that, I'd say that the cashews themselves are good size and quality, and the roasting was perfect."
08	65421,B001EQ55ZO,A3HOGJ49XCSCW7,7/15/08,0,0,4,Who knew Cashews could be so Powerful?,"I really love cashews and these Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper ones were no exception.<br /><br />The cashews arrive in a very nice container, freshly sealed with a decent lid that keeps them quite fresh for a good week or two afterward.<br /><br />I never thought so much flavor could be packed into a tiny nut, but I was wrong.  This product is not for the weak of heart!  As soon as you take you first taste you'll be overcome by the wonderul mix of salt, pepper, and natural cashew goodness.<br /><br />I shared the nuts with a few friends and reviews were mixed.  Half loved them, and half thought they were just way too salty/peppery.  I think you'll really love these if you can handle the extreme flavor, otherwise you might want to look elsewhere."
08	65422,B001EQ55ZO,A2MO8QZTNYYB98,7/14/08,0,0,3,Tasty...almost too tasty,"We love cashews and as we have teenagers always have a jar of them on the counter for quick snacks so I was very interested to try these flavored cashews.<br /><br />The first handful was great. The seasoning is nice but if you have more then one handful the flavors become too strong really fast. A few of our teens tried them out also and had the same feedback.<br /><br />If they had had just a bit less seasoning we would have all liked them much better. If I were to get them again, I'd mix them with the same amount of regular cashews which would be just about the right amount of seasoning for me."

Unfortunately these cashews are so heavily seasoned that I got heartburn from them, and I hardly ever get heartburn. In my opinion when your mouth almost burns from pepper then it's TOO MUCH! The idea of a salt & pepper cashew is a good one but I'd take a plain roasted, salted cashew over these any day. To me, the delicious taste of the cashew itself is ruined by the seasoning."

I believe the flavor is growing on me, though I find more than a small handful is just a bit overpowering.  Maybe that's a good thing for me, as like with most nuts, this is not a low-fat snack."

Nor was I disappointed, but I was surprised. The description promises sea salt with ""a hint"" of pepper. Well, it's a rather big hint. The pepper provides a shock to the taste buds with these cashews. Partly because one expects salt but not pepper with cashews, and partly because, as I stated above, the pepper is a bit thicker than you might expect. And it's somewhat tangy pepper, too. I like spicy, tangy foods so this is not a problem for me. After a couple of handfuls I had to force myself to stop before I wolfed down the whole can. I like them and I'll buy more. But do be aware that, if you like your food--especially your cashews--on the mild side, the tangy pepper here may be overwhelming. It's pretty bold, and my only caveat is, again, the pepper is more than a hint's worth."

Fight on! Of course, fans of that other squad across town, the UCLA Teddy Bears, would probably find this snack just as toothsome, but how great an experience can it be, munching cashews or not, watching grown men dressed out in sissy powder blue?<br /><br />I'd perhaps prefer a little less salt and a tad more pepper, but then I'd fall into the trap set my wife whose inclinations favor a low-sodium diet. At 270mg of Na per serving, these nuts are a bit too briny for her; if they contained less salt, I might be forced to share. And we can't have that, especially as she thinks football is for Neanderthals.<br /><br />No edible is perfect, apparently. The hand-wringing, food nannies make sure of that. Their handiwork is evident on the label with the warning:<br /><br />""ALLERGY INFORMATION: This product is processed on equipment that also processes other tree nuts or peanuts. May contain tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, milk, soy, or sesame seeds.""<br /><br />Happily, perhaps because I grew up in a less fearful age when kids were allowed to go out and play in the dirt and become exposed to all those nasty germs and allergens and thus acquire immune tolerance, I can now eat these SEA SALT & PEPPER CASHEWS by the handful and not worry that I'll go into anaphylactic shock by halftime.<br /><br />Another nice feature is the ergonomically friendly can, done up in a soothing green color, that allows for an easy hand grip.

After a couple of bites, I found the nuts strangely addicting because of the nice pepper taste.<br /><br />I'm not positive if it was because of the amount of salt or the fact that it was sea salt. If the saltiness could be halved down or even paired down to a quarter what it is now, it would be much better. It may certainly fit the beer drinking snack scene, but it's not something I would give to my toddler due to the salt and spiciness of it."

The peppery taste was a bit of a nice compliment and when tasted in with the cashews alluded to a bit of a lime-like flavor, but I found it hard to keep myself from thinking  bout how much salt was in these. It was enough to burn my tongue and lips and cause me to stop eating them, even though they tasted good."

The nuts were fresh, but the seasoning was a bit too heavy-handed - they are very salty and the pepper has more of a bite than I liked.<br /><br />The seasoning gets stronger the lower you get in the can due to it falling off the upper ones and coating the lower ones. While tolerable when first opened, the seasoning becomes way too overpowering once you get half-way down in the can. I found myself putting the nuts in a dish and rolling them around a bit to dislodge some of the seasoning.<br /><br />If you're on a sodium restricted diet (or just want to cut down on sodium) you definitely want to pass on this.<br /><br />If they would dial back the salt by 50% and the pepper by 75%, it would be a great product.

08	65442,B001EQ55ZO,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,7/1/08,0,0,3,"Strong flavor, with room for improvement...","The first thing you'll notice about these peppered cashew nuts is the packaging -- the large green plastic jar seems like overkill, but flipping it over, one finds that it's made of 7th-generation recycled plastic, so I suppose it's relatively eco-friendly (no indication of where it was manufactured; most likely in China)  So, we peel back the outer plastic wrapper (which also acts as a safety seal) and open the container, then check out the nuts.<br /><br />I have to say, the flavoring was much more thickly applied than I'd anticipated, with an almost pasty mix of pepper, salt and spices embedded on all the nuts. The second surprise is that the nuts are much moister than I'd have thought -- I prefer really crisp, dry-roasted nuts, and these were almost damp with the flavoring ingredients. Visually, there's quite a bit of black pepper in each bite, but it doesn't have as much kick as you'd expect. The pepper flavor, like that of the cashews themselves, is overshadowed by the rest of the seasonings -- the dominant tastes are of salt and dried onions, and the cashew umami is obscured to a remarkable degree.  Also, the salt doesn't taste very ""sea salty"", as it is competing with sugar, peanut oil and citric acid (which adds a nice lime-y tang, but also is buried in the mix...)  A much lighter seasoning might be better, one that concentrates on the flavors in this order: sea salt, dry-roast umami, citrus tang.  The other flavors -- onion, oil, sugar -- are just in the way.<br /><br />The final surprise came after I screwed the lid back on, set the jar aside and then came back for another sample. The lid popped right off, the jar slid out of my hand and almost spilled out onto the floor. Had I forgot to fasten it on properly?  Noooo... not quite. It turns out the screw-top lid  doesn't really fit very well onto the container. It screws on, alright, but it pops off quite easily, with slight force ranging from a short tug to just picking up the jar. Another half-turn worth of grooves would probably solve this defect. Also, it would be nice if the product info -- ingredients, nutrition value, etc. -- didn't peel off the container along with the safety seal.<br /><br />In sum, this is an okay snack food, but it could be much better. Mostly, a more subtle, less wham-bam approach to seasoning would help.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Roasted cashews (with peanut or cottonseed oil), sea salt, peanut oil, black pepper, maltodextrin, sugar, granulated onion, citric acid, spice, natural flavor"

As someone who's addicted to peanuts and nuts for snacking (I usually have 2-3 containers open at any given time), I'm always looking for some variety, such as these with their salt+pepper seasoning reminiscent, in some ways, more of chips than nuts.<br /><br />The cashews themselves are high quality, large and meaty.<br /><br />Note the description is accurate, they liberally use both salt and pepper, so the sodium level in these is more than twice that of the similar cannister of Emerald almonds, and the pepper flavor is distinct.  Avoid if you dislike pepper or are on a salt-restricted diet."

Unbeknownst to me, each and every couple I had invited was on the outs with the others, but only in a quiet, teeth-gritted sort of way.<br />The food, however, was a smashing success, especially some spicy pecans that I threw together as I walked in the door about a half hour before my guests. I have never replicated the success of that first batch, but these cashews come close.<br />They have a good balance of sweet (the cashews themselves), salty, and peppery flavor. The pepper is not overpowering and strikes me as just right.<br />The nice thing about the snack is that a few satisfy. I tend to to eat way too many plain cashews when I buy them lightly salted. A very few of these make a nice nibble, and would go great with sake or a martini."

I liked the combination of sea salt and pepper; the nuts were salty without being too salty, and the pepper was just enough to be noticeable without being overpowering.  My wife thought that the sea salt and pepper would be better on a chip or something crunchier, and that the texture of the nut was jarring in combination with the seasoning.  In general, I think these are tasty nuts, and while I don't think I'd be inclined to eat these regularly, I enjoyed them.  Cashew purists who are looking for a pure expression of cashew flavor (which I love myself) are advised to stick with good old regular roasted cashews, however."

They are salty, so if you are watching sodium or don't like a salty taste this probably wouldn't be for you, but when I want some salt, I want some salt.  The pepper was just enough to give them a bite without being overwhelming.  The valued added seasoning of onion/sugar combo was fine, I really couldn't tell that they were in there- I just know that I liked the taste and the size of the cashews.  Also, I like that the lid holds one serving size.  Short of portioning out your own snack bag this is a clever idea so that you don't overeat (if you don't want to).  Overall, a nice snack product.

Imagine `salt `n pepper' potatoes chips and replace the potato flavor with cashews.  It is intense, but I am addicted.  These strongly flavored cashews are truly `over-the-top' in flavor and the citric acid and granulated onion only intensify the flavor.  There really isn't anything especially nutritious about these cashews other than nuts are good for your heart, but I'd think the salt would cancel that out.

Since cashews are a good source for protein and a much better choice than a sugary treat, the added kick of pepper and the mixture with sea salt makes it all the more healthier.

Emerald has great cashews and I initially thought that the true quality of the cashews could not be detected because of the seasonings (besides the sea salt and pepper I could really taste onion). However, like Emerald's plain cashews, the sea salt and pepper ones are addicting and once I got used to the seasonings, I couldn't put them down. My one real complaint is that they are a bit too salty, especially when you get to the end of the can where the salt tends to settle. The cashews come in a container designed to fit into a car's cup holder and the lid holds 1.5 ounce serving of nuts which is the FDA daily recommendation for good heart health. The cashews have no trans fats, are high in protein and are a good source of iron and zinc.

The pepper was too much for them. I loved the pepper but thought there was too much salt. This product claims to be a healthy snack, but I think it would be healthier with about half the salt. Don't get me wrong, they taste great as is, I just won't eat as much at one time since I'm concerned about too much salt in my diet. For me it's a guilty pleasure!"

They were tasty, satisfied both the urge for something sweet and salty, and they came in an attractive container.<br /><br />The only drawback is there is a slight aftertaste to the cashews, but I still think you should give them a try."

I had almost made up my mind that I wasn't going to like them before I even tasted them, because who could improve on the taste of lightly salted cashews? But I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I did actually like them and that they were quite good in fact. I think it was the ""Salt & Pepper"" labeling that put me off. Made me think of eating vegetables or eggs for some reason. In my humble opinion, they should be labeled something like ""Light Peppery Seasoning"" or something like that. The black pepper flavoring is quite light and enhances the cashew taste as does the light salting. I do feel this is a matter of personal taste though as my daughter tried them and wasn't too impressed. I asked her how she would rate them on a scale of 1 to 5 and she said 3. Not bad, but not exceptionally good either. I can't say that they are exceptionally good either, but I would definetly buy them again as I enjoyed the flavor which is slightly spicy but not overpowering."

Obviously, salted cashews will have considerable sodium & fat--they come with the territory, but if you're seriously considering this product to purchase, then the taste/cost are paramount.  I think the cost is fairly reasonable for this relatively expensive nut (much more than peanuts) and the taste is quite good--not as good as their cocoa almonds (Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4)), but pretty good.

The one thing that I prompted me to look at the ingredient list is that they actually taste very TART which was not expected due to the citric acid that's included.<br /><br />The product is good but I could do without the ""tangi-ness"".

The black pepper adds enough flavor that I think the salt may be unnecessary.

So I was excited to try these cashews as cashews are my favorite nut.  Sadly, this product is a big time disappointment.<br /><br /> Like many companies, Emerald is now trying the ""if ""blank"" sells well, then ""blank"" with crazy added seasonings will be better"".  When it's not true-it takes the simple and delicious cashew and douses it with so much seasoning that the cashew itself can no longer even be tasted.  If you like cashews then skip this product and stick with this companies simply roasted cashews instead."

In addition to salt and a slightly spicy dose of pepper, the cashews are coated with traces of sweetness and onion.  These cashews are great to have on hand as a snack, to accompany cocktails, or to add flavor to a stir fry or vegetable dish.<br /><br />So why a rating of four instead of five stars?  I prefer snacks to be packaged in glass containers instead of the plastic Emerald uses (however, chances of damage in shipment are next to zero in plastic packaging, so I see their reasons).  In addition, the nuts might benefit from slightly less onion flavor.  However, these are minor gripes, and mainly a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />Emerald's salt and pepper cashews taste great, can be used in a variety of ways, and are a great snack to have on hand.

There's actually so much that I can hardly tell I am eating cashews at all.

LOL!<br /><br />Peppercorn's punchy taste is usually a turn-off for me. But for these Emerald cashews, it works.

If you want pure nut and no seasoning, you'd want to run screaming from this product. You need to be a serious salt/pepper fan for it to work. It took 1 day for us to consume this 10 oz can.

Voila!<br />The mint version is the most refreshing, and a mind-opener too (it wakes your mind up better than coffee; I keep a bottle with me at work!)."

They recently changed box sizes from 16 to 13.25 ounces and kept the price the same.  This product is already higher priced than most other brands of pasta; I justified the price because of the reduced carbs and comparable taste to regular pasta products, but the sudden reduction from 16 to 13.25 ounces without a drop in price has got me questioning whether I still want to purchase this product.<br /><br />I just went to Dreamfields' website to see if they had an announcement on their homepage concerning the change in size and they didn't; in my opinion a change of this magnitude deserves some mention on their  homepage.  The company sent no announcement of the size change via email (I am on their mailing list). I think the consumer at least deserves an explanation.  Not doing so is bad customer service and there is something about it that seems sneaky to me."

I DRANK IT UP!,"Whenever I finish a strenuous workout, the first thing I want to do is slam a cold, thick milkshake down my throat. There's nothing quite as refreshing as a creamy, sickly sweet, dairy-based beverage to cool you down after pushing your body to its breaking point. I've slammed can after can of this and felt like a Superman.<br /><br />But seriously, I think that's exactly what this drink is for. No, really? I'm supposed to devour a 370 calorie milkshake after every workout? I understand it contains a lot of protein, but at 370 calories, you might as well be eating liquid hamburger. Oh, I see this is also supposed to be a ""meal replacement."" Just don't let your kids drink these to the exclusion of actual food.<br /><br />The milkshake was alright, though. Honestly, it wasn't much more than a Carnation Instant Breakfast. It had that same taste and consistency. And despite its calories, it didn't fill me up at all. I guess that's what you get for drinking your calories. I probably wouldn't get it again."

Now, comes the ""but"" regarding these Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews - someone had a heavy hand with the pepper.  For us, they're really hot, too spicey to be eaten by the handful and even in smaller quantities we find ourselves reaching for something to drink.<br /><br /> They are also tasty, definitely a different flavor for cashews.  Perhaps a cocktail buffet would be a good place for them where people will just  use a spoon to serve themselves several.  But, (there's that word again) - we didn't find them appropriate for snacking or nibbling while watching TV."

The pepper flavor doesn't compare with freshly ground pepper, naturally, but it's pretty good for a commercially made product.<br /><br />It's a tiny bit too salty for my taste, but I know that tends to be personal preference that's different for everybody.<br /><br />The nuts are well roasted and crunchy. They're also a really nice size--too often I see tiny nuts that don't have much flavor. These nuts are tasty.<br /><br />I would get these again.

The pepper further adds to the problem. There's just not a lot of cashew taste, because the sea salt and the pepper overpower the taste of the nuts.<br /><br />I would not purchase these in the store - especially since our local Kroger sells other similar Emerald brands for $6.99 for the 10 oz cannister.

I am fond of spicy foods, and when I order them in restaurants I do NOT tell the waiter, ""Mild, please"".<br /><br />The idea of putting pepper on nuts is, I think, a good one and could work well. But there is just too much pepper in these. And not a little too much, a LOT too much.<br /><br />The nuts themselves seem fine. Nice and fresh with good texture. I think the amount of salt is good, but that's difficult to determine with taste buds overwhelmed by pepper.<br /><br />If Emerald would use a quarter to a half as much pepper, I think this could be a winner."

The nuts are wonderful. I plan on soaking off the seasoning and using them in a chicken recipe. But there is no possability I could eat them as the manufacturer has served them up.<br /><br />To be sure that this was not some oversensitivity on my part, I offered the cannister to a friend -- casually and without comment. He ate two or three and begged me for a beverage to clear his mouth, saying he thought he must be ""allergic"" to something in them, because they ""made his mouth burn.""<br /><br />I'm just baffled that the seasoning is this unpleasantly strong yet sold in a cannister that suggests a mild freshness. I truly regret that I could not give Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews a higher rating."

08	65502,B001EQ55ZO,A3A6GXILVT9JNW,6/23/08,5,6,2,Not for cashew lovers,"When I first opened the canister the smell of pepper was burst forth.  At the first taste, first the salt and then the pepper flavors completely overwhelmed the cashew flavor.  Finally a hint of cashew came through. When  other family members tried these their reactions were similar - too much seasoning and too little cashew.<br /><br />Those who are fans of cashews will  probably be disappointed that there is so little cashew flavor but those who like salt and especially those who like pepper will be pleased.  It just seems to me that there is no need to use cashews in this product, peanuts would do just fine since the salt and pepper flavors completely dominate this product."

In fact, when the box came in the mail, I raced to open it so I could try out these little gems.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I expected to be a favorable experience turned out to be terrible.<br /><br />My first taste of these nuts was like having orange pith (the white part between the peel and the orange) fried in oil, doused in a vat of salt and sugar and dipped in black pepper.  There is virtually no cashew flavor left in these little nuts.<br /><br />I love cashews.  I have eaten them raw and roasted in many ways for years.  This experience with Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews was an assault on my taste buds.<br /><br />The salt with citric acid combination is terrible.  When you combine it with the maltodextrin AND sugar, the cashew flavor is corrupted beyond recognition.  Then adding the black pepper makes it even worse.  A handful of these *nuts* is like dumping a salt shaker in your mouth.  It is almost repulsive.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are pretty greasy as well.<br /><br />I am very sorry that these cashews were treated this way.<br /><br />I would have preferred the graceful simplicity of simple roasted cashews with a DUSTING of sea salt and black pepper over them- nothing more.  The sugar and maltodextrin ruin this mix- and the addition of citric acid makes the finish quite bitter.  I do not like these at all.<br /><br />If you love sweet things and don't mind bitterness and a mouth full of salt, you might enjoy these.  However, if you love cashews and prefer the seasonings to COMPLIMENT them instead of overpower them, pass on these."

Or it could be a bad thing because I've still got the munchies.<br /><br />I think I'll probably stick with the plain old salted cashews from Emerald.

Too often snack foods avoid pepper, or when they do use it, they overwhelm the taste of the pepper with the salt.  This product is an exception.  The tang of the sea salt mixes well the large grained black pepper.  Emerald also uses large high quality cashews for the mix and not cheap smaller nuts that they can disguise with seasoning.  I love cashews in any event, but this product is simply the best seasoned nuts I have enjoyed for some time."
08	65509,B001EQ55ZO,AEJAGHLC675A7,7/16/08,1,2,5,"I'm a cashew purist, but...","... this is a five-star taste treat for sure!<br /><br />Had only tasted a couple of these once before, and found them quite interesting. Cashews are a personal favorite, and have been for years. Normally don't go in for anything but lightly salted or plain cashews, and personal preference over time has ruled out the dry roasted, chocolate covered or honey roasted varieties.<br /><br />That being said, expected that black pepper and cashews could go together but must say that these these turned out to be a surprising taste treat. The nuts were high quality and had a fresh taste which combined surprisingly well with the pepper and sea salt. These are only 160 calories per serving, which is the same as a handful of regular cashews. They are a good source of iron and zinc, and have no trans fat.<br /><br />Must also note that Emerald's ""On the Go"" canister"" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />Ingredients: roasted cashews, sea salt, peanut oil, black pepper, others.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings per container: 10<br />Calories per serving: 160<br />Calories from fat: 120<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br /><br />Pros: good sized cashews, lightly salted and a nice balance with the pepper, combined with an excellent natural buttery cashew taste. No trans fat.<br /><br />Cons: oil and sodium... but it's that sea salt that makes them great.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want some really flavorsome cashews, Emerald does a tremendous job with these. Will order more of them for sure...<br /><br />For those who prefer their cashews plain, try Emerald Nuts Cashew Halves & Pieces, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4) or Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4), both of which have outstanding natural buttery cashew taste, and are packaged in the same handy canister.<br /><br />Warning: any of these can be habit-forming!"

The nuts were nice and crunchy but although I like spicy things, these tasted overly peppery to me.  After you get through that, you get hit with an onion/garlic taste that lingers.  I probably should have done it beforehand, but when I tasted this I HAD to check the ingredients.  Yes, they did indeed not only pepper the cashews, they also added onion powder.<br /><br />Sooo... If the thought of eating crunchy cashews seasoned with black pepper, onion powder and salt sound like it might be up your alley, then by all means give these a try.

I tried these and found that the normal cashew taste was present with a very strong presence of salt and prettty spicy pepper.  I did not detect that much of an aftertaste. Consistency was pretty much normal for cashews.  I highly recommend - as an occasional alternative to the ""normal"" brand.  The novelty factor for a product with this much ""zing"" is pretty high.  What tastes really good with the first handful... could pretty well go south after too long.<br /><br />I believe that this product makes for a pretty good desk ornament - your visitors will grab one handful, rave about what a trendsetter you are, then leave you without demolishing the whole container (which happens to me regularly with their honey roasted almonds).<br /><br />One thing that worries me is that so many folks leaving reviews have complained about the aftertaste and consistency.

Granted people react to seasonings (salt and pepper) in  very different ways, but  the combination of salt and pepper on the cashews was not a taste bud delight.  The combination of both flavors added to the natural goodness of the cashews was disappointing.  Perhaps it would be popular in a party mix, but eaten out of the can the spices were a little too strong and distracting.  I like the idea of sea salt as opposed to normal table salt, but the pepper was not a bonus.  Edible, but not delicious..."

The seasoning just overpowers the nut. It makes you want to drink something, right now! The pepper sneaks up and gets you too! I'd expect that in a chili flavored snack, I think this should be more subtle.  It's too bad as the actual quality of the nuts is good. Whole and half pieces in good shape, not too many broken pieces.<br />I found something of interest as I read the label. It contains peanut oil. If you're allergic to peanuts but not all nuts, you need to avoid this too. Another note on the label. When you open the package you tear away the upper part of the wrapper. That takes away the top part of the nutrition label with some important information. It would have been nice to have lowered the information so it survived the opening of the package."

The flavor experience, on the other hand, is open to interpretation. I have never used much salt in my diet so I found them salty and the pepper aftertaste marred the cashew flavor to the point of masking it. In other words, I could pretty much only taste salt and pepper with a hint of cashew. Other nuts, such as peanuts and almonds, bear seasoning better than cashews therefore the flavor concept might work better if understated. Because of my particular lack of exposure to salt I double checked my opinion with several family members and friends and without any input on my part they all pretty much agreed with me: the seasoning combo was too much for the cashews, albeit they seemed great to eat while drinking beer.<br /><br />They have 270 mg of sodium and 2.5g of saturated fat.

However it just was really hard to eat and then we were both thirsty for long after eating a couple of handfuls.<br /><br />We are both black pepper lovers and we loved the black pepper taste.<br /><br />If only these had perhaps 1/3 the amount of sea salt with this same amount (or more) of black pepper then they would rank a 5 star rating.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are excellent.<br /><br />I have tried other nut products from this company and loved them."

I was a bit leery about the salt and pepper flavor. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I was mainly concerned that the pepper would be too strong. I actually found the salt to be a bit overwhelming. As I got closer to the bottom of the canister, the salt taste became stronger and the nuts at the bottom were very salty-almost inedible. If you love cashews this is a nice change from just salted as the pepper gives the nut a little ""kick."""

The flavor is great, though it was important to pay a bit of attention when eating as occasionaly one nut will have a insane amount of pepper, but over all a really great taste. The nuts were fresh and not too salty, which is a problem with a lot of nuts.  The container was also very nice and convenient to use."

At first taste, I wasn't sure what to make of them.  The pepper taste was strong, almost overpowering the cashew flavor.  But I soon found myself enjoying the flavor, even craving them.  This is certainly not a flavor for everyone, but if you prefer savory flavors to some of the sweeter nut varieties out there, give these a try.  And I have to once again comment that I love the canister these come in.  They fit well in a car cup-holder, and I can just pop the canister in my messenger for a between-class snack, without worrying that the container will pop open, scattering nuts everywhere."

At first, I thought they were just okay.  I ate a few and then put them away.  A short while later, I found myself wanting a few more and this seemed to just keep happening.  The pepper makes for an interesting flavor, and when combined with the sea salt - well, they became strangely addictive.  I recommend anyone who likes cashews to give them a try!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars, though, was that some of the cashews were overwhelmed with salt."

There are other flavors as well (a hint of garlic, I think) so the label be slightly misleading. This product is definitely worth trying. My teen loved it too and it disappeared quickly in our house.<br /><br />If you like unique flavor combinations and are willing to kick things up a notch, give this product a try. Odds are, you won't regret it, if the preferences of several teens, 2 adults and one bird (who flew down and ate a couple of dropped pieces - we were outside) gives you something to go on.<br /><br />Some other details that might be of interest: not too salty, large sized cashews, nicely roasted. There. That should do it :) Enjoy!"

The cashews themselves are fresh and large with a good rich cashew taste. The pepper and salt add a wonderful flavor and the result is a very pleasant snack with a great aftertaste that kept me going back for more and more. Yes, they were a tad salty (especially the last 1/4 of the canister) but to me that was the only drawback. I can see how, if someone did NOT like spicy or peppery foods, they might be ""too bold"" as others have said, but come on, they are salt and PEPPER flavor...what do you expect?<br /><br />I plan to get some more in the near future...my canister is empty!"

The pepper is just enough to add an enticing spiciness to the nuts without overpowering them and the seasalt is perfect.<br /><br />I figured I'd snack on a few and save the rest for later, well I'd eat a few close it up and minutes later open the container right back up to nab a 'few' more.<br /><br />Will this replace my standard flavors - no, but I definitely won't overlook them and assume they aren't going to be to my liking anymore - I now know better.<br /><br />Of course my husband is laughing at me because he's been eating salt and pepper potato chips for about the past year and I refused to even try them."

I love cashews and thought the Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper would be great.  However, it was evident with my first handful that there was way too much salt and pepper for my taste.  Maybe that was a good thing because it slowed down the momentum of how I usually eat cashews. Each time I had more, I had to wet a paper towel to soak up the excess seasoning.<br /><br />I quite imagine that for recipes that call for cashews, the pre-seasoning would probably be a welcomed addition."

However, I would warn that this may not be to everyone's taste - at least at first.  The sea salt definitely has more kick than the usual salted nuts and the pepper gives it a decided bite.  For those whose taste in nuts tend more towards sweeter concoctions, this may be a bit much.  But for those who like dark beer, strong coffee, and snacks with attitude, this is a welcome treat."

She got them first in goodie bags from Asian children in her class. Then a Chinese friend started bringing them to her. Now, I am a regular at the Asian grocery store in town, primarily to buy these. My daughter does not eat a lot of sweets but takes a package of these in her lunch every day. I keep a bag in the car since they are snacks that don't need refrigeration and my kids are starved when I pick them up. The Amazon price is a little cheaper than what I pay at the Asian grocery and is a lot less than they are at our regular grocery store. Plus, I won't have them looking at me oddly for buying 8 bags at a time.<br /><br />January 2009 - I just went to order more and found that they no longer ship from Amazon and shipping is over $10. I will now be buying them locally since at the old price, they were almost the same as the Asian grocery but were more convenient. With shipping, Amazon is not a good choice."

They are not chocolate-covered but have a chocolate flavoring.

I took the container to the kitchen where it managed to last a few more days.<br /><br />These are an interesting variation on the traditional salted cashews. I would not buy them instead of traditional cashews, but would be happy to have them as an occasional change of pace. One star off because the onion leaves a mild aftertaste."
08	65533,B001EQ55ZO,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,7/4/08,0,1,3,Not bad,"These are still fattening and overpriced, but the sea salt and pepper keep the eating experience slow. Instead of munching on a whole can of fattening cashews without much flavor, you eat the nuts slowly. And they are very salty (and peppery as well). So they are still fattening but they are slowly fattening you for the feast."

During breaks or on the run, Emerald's Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews are a zesty change from drab, empty-calorie snacks.<br /><br />Nutrition wise:  It adds a healthy dose of protein, iron, zinc, and good lipids (fats) to the nut mix.  For kids, it's a low-sugar alternative to everyday peanut butter.<br /><br />The designer canister fits snugly in your car beverage container, and the nifty lid is perfect for portion control.

I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen  are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as ""smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""lemon, mint"".  The web site also says, ""Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste."" I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Zen gets only four stars.<br />****"

After trying the cocoa covered almonds (simply delicious), I had high hopes for these babies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. They are pretty good.  But, I had some jalapeno flavored peanuts a week or so ago that were delicious.  Black pepper while it gives these a little kick is not enough for a real spice lover.  It does kind of sneak up on you after you've had a few though.<br /><br />BTW, the nuts are also flavored with sugar, citric acid (adds a touch of tartness, I think) onion, ""spice"" and ""natural flavor"" in addition to the sea salt and black pepper.  You can definitely taste the sugar, onion and the citric acid (kind of a citrus twang- not a lot, just a hint)  That's something I would have liked to have known before purchasing.  But the taste that comes through is the sea salt and black pepper.  Actually quite a bit of black pepper. After trying them over again, I don't like them as much as at first.<br /><br />If you're looking for real cashew flavor with just a hint of spiciness, these are OK- not bad at all. But, not stellar either.<br /><br />BTW, the lid that is a serving size is a GREAT idea for those trying to control their snack portions, which is really hard to do with something as addictive as cashews."

The product has surpassed what I expected, with the warm, mellow taste that reminds me of northern woods, campfires, and the tingle of frost in the air.  After being raised on the authentic flavor of real maple syrup, artificial syrups are a big disappointment; this product enlivened the taste of my Saturday morning pancakes."

There is a tangy citrisy flavor that doesn't make it either.<br /><br />I honestly say, I tried a handful, husband tried a handful and we said, NO WAY!  The claim is SEA Salt, whatever that is;  I know I wouldn't drink sea water, so why would I like SEA Salt.  The cashews are hot and spicy and overall, the heavy seasonings take away the original flavor, and without original flavor you have something completely different.<br /><br />Cashews generally are a good source of snacks and these have no transfat which is good.

If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Tazo are your Earl Greys of choice. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."

I usually like my nuts plain or lightly salted.  The seasoning here seemed a bit extreme.<br /><br />However, by the time I reached the ""bottom of the barrel,"" these nuts had grown on me and I have to say they are pretty darn good.  The spicing really suits the cashews.  If you like salty, peppery nuts with a very strong onion aftertaste, then you will really enjoy this offering from Emerald. They also make some Cocoa Roasted Almonds that I just have to try.

However, I was slightly disappointed in these cashews.  While they're very fresh, there was much too much seasoning, especially going overboard (haha, get it?) with the sea salt.  Furthermore, I question whether real sea salt was used, which typically has larger grain sizes than table salt.  It looks just like regular table salt.<br /><br />However, there is a saving grace for these nuts, and it prevented me from dishing out just 3 stars.  What to do with overly salty, peppery cashews?  Stir fry some chopped chicken breasts, and make Chinese chicken & cashews with bell peppers.  Don't bother adding salt to the chicken- just add in these cashews, and you're good to go!"

That being said, I have to come out and say I just don't like these cashews, which are practically encrusted with salt and pepper.<br /><br />In our family we don't salt and pepper our food liberally, so maybe my wife and I were particularly sensitive to the salt-and-pepper blast of these cashews. Again, it's a matter of taste: if you love salt and pepper, you might like these.<br /><br />To write a fair review, I decided to wash the seasonings off the cashews under tap water to taste the bare nut underneath. I was surprised to find that the salt and pepper didn't just rinse off. Something was making it adhere to the cashews. So I soaked and rinsed and rubbed with my fingers a little more and finally got all the seasoning off the 5 or 6 cashews I had in my hand.<br /><br />Once I got all the seasoning off (or so I thought), I noticed something else that surprised me: the cashews were still greasy. This wasn't intended to be a whole-day affair, so I just popped two in my mouth. The first thing I noticed was that the cashew retained a slightly crisp, roasted character even after the drenching. That was the good news. Then I dropped the remaining cashews in my mouth, and a few seconds later came the bad news: I started tasting that pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop, poking its way through an otherwise tasty though plain roasted cashew.<br /><br />If you'd like a simpler review, my wife, a no-nonsense woman, ate just a couple and said, ""I hate these.

This is one of those weird combos of ingredients that end up tasting very artificial.  In fact, the coating of sugar, granulated onion, and salt even has a strange texture that feels sort of plastic-y on the tongue and does not seem to dissolve.  The ingredient list is ridiculously long for a product marketed to appear simple and natural.  Why was all the artificial and processed junk added, when the basics of cashews, salt, and pepper could have been so tasty?<br /><br />If these had truly been as advertised I'm sure I would have eaten half the container. :)  Instead, I was only able to eat 3-4 nuts, then closed up the container.

08	65547,B001EQ55ZO,AYB8XLKTYMTTX,6/24/08,2,2,3,Tasty Cashews Somewhere Under All That Seasoning!,"I'm a big fan of Emerald nut products, especially their almonds, but I have to say I'm not nuts about Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews.  Cashews are generally tasty enough so all they need is a little roasting with a sprinkling of sea salt to heighten their flavor.  In this case, the poor cashews don't stand much of a chance against all the salt and, especially pepper--not to mention the granulated onion.  Where cashews are concerned, less would definitely be more!"
08	65548,B001EQ55ZO,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,6/24/08,2,2,5,A peppery little bite!,"I like salted cashews to begin with...and I just discovered that a good sprinkling of pepper makes them even better.  The taste is great. All that fruity sweetness in a cashew is brought out by the pepper. These nuts have plenty of salt and enough paper to leave the tiniest burn on the tongue.  The peppery flavor enhances the taste of the cashew and heat is just the right intensity. If you have an ultra-sensitve or immature palette and cannot abide anything spicy, you may want to give these a miss. But if like a little bite in your bite, you'll gobble these goodies down. Serve them with beer, alongside a sandwich plate, or tossed on top of any salad. They'll add a little crunch and terrific flavor.  I liked the Cocoa-poweder dusted almonds that Emerald recently introduced. They are subtle, unusual and delicate. These cashews, on the other hand, are bold...all that salt and pepper pack a lot of flavor into every nut.  The taste is so intense that one handful is very satisfying...good news for us who like to watch our calories."

I just wish it came in glass and not plastic though it is a good plastic at least #2.  Also, gets a little messy around spout as there isn't a nice pour spout on this, but small price to pay for the money saved.  We use this every day for oats or waffles/pancakes."

As others have said, too much salt and way too much pepper! Still the nuts are crunchy and fresh although I can taste some suger on them.<br /><br />The pepper leaves a hot aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for several minutes. I ate a 4th of the can then had to get something to drink<br /><br />If you like pepper then these are for you. If not then maybe you should get something else instead..."

Instead they remind me of the time I put a cup of salt into the cookie batch instead of sugar. There's quite a bit of pepper too, and it's nice if you like things peppery now and then, and most of us do.<br /><br />The best one can do is try to shake or paper towel some of the salt off (unfortunately this takes the pepper off as well) and sprinkle the nuts on a simple salad with just oil and vinegar for dressing, or perhaps nibble them along with some very plain veggies, like celery sticks. Serving size is listed as 1 oz. (1/4 cup) which gives you 160 calories, 4 grams of protein, and 270 mg of the dreaded sodium.<br /><br />Like other Emerald nuts that I have really liked, Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews would have been delicious and a 5 star item with much less salt, so they are a disappointment. Perhaps Emerald can change their recipe a little to give us ""menos sal y mas pimienta."" The sturdy container has many ""post nut"" uses, with a label that comes off easily, a lid that screws on tightly with ease, and a shape that fits the palm of your hand, as well as the cup holder in your car."

However I found it very disappointing: there is way too much salt on the nuts, which covers the flavor instead of highlighting the natural sweetness of the cashews.<br /><br />Also, they could have chosen a more environment friendly packaging, like recyclable see-through plastic, which is also less likely to leach into the foods contained within."

I have tried other snacks with Sea Salt that I found enjoyable, but I cannot recommend this product.  I will wash the seasonings off of these Cashews and  add them to a spicy soup."
08	65553,B001EQ55ZO,A3H7AOFQDPU0JV,6/22/08,2,2,5,Purchase only if you have more willpower than me,"This is the easiest review I have ever written. I am in love with a nut (my spouse is too...and both of us really like these cashews).<br /><br />I like cashews plain or salted...I like salt & pepper potato chips. So I couldn't say no to this product when I saw it on Amazon (I have yet to see it in my local grocery which is probably a good thing). From the first taste, I really was in snack heaven. I very easily could have eaten the entire canister. They are lightly salted & lightly peppered with just a hint of onion. There is very little pepper-burn that some aggressive chips can have. If you stick to the serving size (difficult) they're only 120 calories. Fantastic.<br /><br />I don't give many five star reviews, there's always room for improvement. At 4.75 a canister, I guess these could be cheaper...but that's comparable to lower quality grocery store cashews & they taste much better.<br /><br />They're also available at a slightly higher price point (per ounce) in 2 oz. packs. If you DON'T have more will power than me, I would suggest buying them that way to avoid overindulgence...but who am I to talk? I'm having a little baggie of them for breakfast right now!"
08	65554,B001EQ55ZO,A1N5FSCYN4796F,6/25/08,4,5,3,"Should Be Called Onion, Sea Salt, & Pepper Cashews","This is the second type of nuts that I have tried from Emerald with the other being the Cocoa Roast Almonds.  While the almonds were a sweet and salty snack, these are salty and spicy.  As with the Almonds, the lid measures a 1/4 cup serving of nuts.  After eating these for a few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />As you can tell from the headline, these didn't turn out to be quite what I was expecting.  Granulated onion is listed on the ingredients along with ""spices"", but the onion flavor comes through rather strongly with the salt and the pepper.  While the taste grew on my pretty quickly, I found that these made me very thirsty.  Compared to the 25 mg of sodium in the Cocoa Roast Almonds, these cashews clock in at 270 mg.  The almonds also win with 210 mg of potassium versus only 140 mg in the cashews.<br /><br />In the end, though, the taste is what is going to make or break this product for most people.  What you need to know is that the flavor of these cashews is very strong, and it doesn't come from the cashews themselves.  If a strong salt, pepper, and onion flavor is what you are looking for in a snack, this will be right up your alley.  For me personally, they are something that I wouldn't turn down if someone offered them to me.  However, I probably won't go out of my way to buy more of them.  Finally as with all nuts you have to be disciplined because the serving size is small for the calories you get."

I ended up using them in stir-fry and didn't have to add any salt and pepper to the dish!!  I don't recommend them at all unless you REALLY like lots of seasoning (and I THOUGHT I liked salt!)."
08	65561,B001EQ55ZO,AEJAGHLC675A7,10/2/08,1,1,5,Like cashews? Bet you can't eat just one!,"Had only tasted a couple of these once before, and found them quite interesting. But if you're going to do a taste test the right way, you really need to get a canister of these for yourself: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55ZO"">Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 10oz Canister</a>. Cashews are a personal favorite, and have been for years. Normally don't go in for anything but lightly salted or plain cashews, and personal preference over time has ruled out the dry roasted, chocolate covered or honey roasted varieties.<br /><br />That being said, expected that black pepper and cashews could go together but must say that these these turned out to be a surprising taste treat. The nuts were high quality and had a fresh taste which combined surprisingly well with the pepper and sea salt. These are only 160 calories per serving, which is the same as a handful of regular cashews. They are a good source of iron and zinc, and have no trans fat.<br /><br />Must also note that Emerald's ""On the Go"" canister"" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />You can also get the same thing in a different packaging here: Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24).<br /><br />Ingredients: roasted cashews, sea salt, peanut oil, black pepper, others.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings per container: 10<br />Calories per serving: 160<br />Calories from fat: 120<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br /><br />Pros: good sized cashews, lightly salted and a nice balance with the pepper, combined with an excellent natural buttery cashew taste. No trans fat.<br /><br />Cons: oil and sodium... but it's that sea salt that makes them great.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want some really flavorsome cashews, Emerald does a tremendous job with these. Will order more of them for sure...<br /><br />For those who prefer their cashews plain, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2RVY"">Emerald Nuts Cashew Halves & Pieces, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55YU"">Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a>, both of which have outstanding natural buttery cashew taste, and are packaged in the same or similar handy canisters.<br /><br />Warning: any of these can be habit-forming!"

I eagerly bit into my first one and was replused by the oily taste. Since I always make my kids take 3 bites of everything, I kept chewing. It didn't get any better. Soon a salty taste mixed in with the oil, followed by the flavor of stale dimestore pepper - the kind grandmas keep in a tin in their cupboard for years because no one uses it. After completing the first tortureous bite, I ate 2 more nuts just to be sure they were not some acquired taste or novelty I may be missing out on. They were not. Took a good brushing and rinsing with Listerine to burn the flavor out of my mouth.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars because I eat a lot of fresh foods and an above average amount of raw foods. Some one more used to a processed food flavor might find them more desirable than I did."

I can definitely taste the onion and citric acid (provides a bit of tartness), and cannot quite put my finger on the mystery spice.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are reasonably sized, most are whole or halves, with some broken pieces.  I've uploaded a photo above so you can see them.<br /><br />But ugh.  The taste is just not for me, and there is too much of it.  I think the rare person who really likes the salt/pepper/onion/mystery-spice flavor might enjoy these, as at least one reviewer has, but I'll pass in the future -- and I *LOVE* cashews in general.

I usually avoid salty snacks, but find the sea salt and pepper a good combination and the container is a nice size and design. I could see these being especially good with/ after a couple of beers."

However, the result is way too salty. If there was one-tenth the amount of salt, I might have tasted the pepper and -- even better -- the nuts.<br /><br />Another problem is the twist-on lid. It doesn't stay secure, which means the nuts are going to get stale, and maybe spill."

So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end!  This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.<br /><br />The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.<br /><br />With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders.

There is also a hint of onion flavor with some citric acid to give them a slightly sour taste. Some cashews were almost completely encrusted with coarse salt making them almost bitter in taste. I found it hard to have more than 2-3 cashews at one time. Combining a handful of these cashews with a cocktail is a sure way to get heartburn!<br /><br />The price is also on the higher side. I prefer the store branded lightly salted and far less oily tinned cashews you can get at any grocery store to these.

The salt and pepper combine for an irresistible, slightly hot combination that's hard to put down (if you have plenty to drink, of course).<br /><br />Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews come packaged in the kind of handy plastic cylinder with a sturdy lid that my grandma would wash and use to store sewing supplies.

My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing."

08	65573,B001EQ55ZO,AB4SFDDO5DT8P,7/3/08,1,1,4,A strangely exotic treat that grows on you... but bring water!,"Okay, it's almost impossible to screw up cashews.  So, that'll net three stars right there.  The idea behind these seasonings had me worried, though.  It was so obvious that someone must've been avoiding it for a reason.  After enjoying them, I'm not sure why this wasn't done a long time ago.  In short, the snack works.  I had seen the Emerald Robert Goulet ad and knew that the company was being run by mad geniuses, but I could never find the brand.  Until now.  A quick breakdown...<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />They really lay on the ""sea salt.""  And I find the idea of ""sea salt"" vaguely pretentious.  It all tastes like salt to this Philistine.  Anyway, there's a lot of it here.  Make sure you have cocktails (these go very well with martinis, gin & tonics, or scotch), sodas, or water to mitigate the mouth-puckering amount of salt.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />Great container... for one person.  Easily fits into a car or movie theater cup-holder.  (Of course, the squatter Planter's containers double as nut bowls, but then, they're useless on the go.)  If you're on your own, you can pretty much ""drink"" the snack out of the container.  If you just lick the seasonings off the nut before biting in, as a friend of mine did, you won't get a fair idea of why they're good.  The flavors -- salt, pepper, and the buttery cashew taste -- only work when you've chewed them together.  At that point, food chemistry takes over and the mix takes on a sophisticated zing.<br /><br />Overall, an oddball snack with an air of hoity-toity, cocktail-hour sophistication.  This is the eccentric, world-traveler uncle of snacks.  A wacky-yet-bland idea that works best after you've melded the flavors for a few bites.  And I commend Emerald on one other point.  Nuts are my favorite snack, and I tend to stick to the traditional brands -- Planter's, Diamond, Mauna Loa.  These were of an equal quality -- large, not broken into pieces (mostly), faintly sweet, and very fresh.<br /><br />PS --<br />Since writing this review, I found a similar product at World Market.  The Emerald brand is far superior."

I love the Popchips and they do taste like potato chips unlike other products I have tried.  One serving is 3 points on the WW point system and you can have 18-22 chips, depending on the flavor you choose.  Very good!"

Then I finally found these and I love them!  They're strong tasting and I actually like them better than regular salt & vinegar chips.  They're less oily and I don't feel sick or guilty after having some.  The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack, but the 3.25 ounce bags end up being cheaper so I divide it up into 3 ziplock bags once I open them.  It works great!"

08	65574,B001EQ55ZO,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,7/1/08,1,1,1,Too Salty and Too Peppery Cashews,"Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews were quite a disappointment.  The cashews are rather small and a bit broken up (which could have been from the shipping) although they seem to be of good quality.  The problem with this product, however, is that it goes way overboard on the salt and pepper spices.  They nuts are too salty and too peppery and just not very enjoyable.  And they get even more salty and more peppery, thus less pleasant, the further down the container you go.<br /><br />I love cashews, but these are ruined by the spices."
08	65575,B001EQ55ZO,A2GPEV42IO41CI,7/1/08,1,1,1,How could they do this to cashews?,"I love cashews, but Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews have too much pepper on them for me.  They look dirty, taste peppery, and leave a burning sensation in my mouth.  The pepper takes over completely and there is very little actual cashew-taste.<br /><br />Emerald has some good products, like the Emerald Marcona Almonds, but this time I think they are trying too hard to be different.  I am definitely disappointed and would not buy this product.<br /><br />PS.  I rinsed them off and they tasted fine.  (Hardly an endorsement.)"
08	65576,B001EQ55ZO,A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL,7/1/08,1,1,1,"Bold, but not for me","I have the feeling that people are either going to love this or hate it.  For me, I hated it.  The salt and pepper combo is extremely aggressive.  The chunks of salt are so large that sometimes they make a {crunch} when you bite down on a particularly large one.  The pepper is also large flakes and there is a lot of it.<br /><br />After just a few of these I felt a bit sick to my stomach and now even the thought of them makes me a little queasy.  I have loved the Emerald product line up until this one.  I do give them respect for taking chances but I think they went too aggressive on this one."
08	65577,B001EQ55ZO,A1JOANG98KBFKU,6/30/08,1,1,3,Very heavy on the salt.,"I enjoy a variety of nuts for snacks and cooking. This is definitely more the snack-variety.  I liked that the nuts tasted very fresh and had a pleasant aroma when I opened the canister. The canister itself is very convenient and wide enough to reach into for the snack without scraping your knuckles on a rough plastic rim.  The pepper flavor is significant, but not overpowering. A good balance.  However, I like salty snacks, but found this to be a little too salty, even at the risk of drowning out the flavor of the cashew.  If you like VERY salty, these are good, but if you like mildly salty, steer clear.  I can't even imagine how the ones on the bottom of the canister would taste."
08	65578,B001EQ55ZO,ACEA95FQS1AVP,6/30/08,1,1,4,SALTY!,"My first impression of these cashews was that they are very salty.  Sea salt has a stronger flavor than traditional salt and it comes through in spades in these.  So, those who don't like or want too much salt may not want to try these.  Also, true cashew lovers may not appreciate them since the salt and pepper seasoning *almost* overpowers the nuts.  That I said, after the initial startlement, I found I liked them very much.<br /><br />I don't usually care for cashews since they are softer than other nuts I prefer.  But the extra spicy aspect the pepper gives these (and I admit to loving salt) make them a nice change.  I needed a large glass of ice water, but I did enjoy eating them!  I would buy them again, though not in bulk as offered through Amazon.  They are too strong for regular snacking.  However, if they ever offer a mixed nut selection I wouldn't hesitate if these were included.  Recommended to those who like salty treats, and those looking for something different."
08	65579,B001EQ55ZO,A1C6ZJNWKYK485,6/29/08,1,1,2,"""Peppery"" is the Word","Wow... VERY peppery! I love cashews, and I love salted cashews, so ""Salt and Pepper"" Cashews sounded intriguing... unfortunately, this product has too much pepper for me. The pepper overpowered the taste of the cashews. I would never buy these. I'll stick with good old salted cashews."
08	65580,B001EQ55ZO,A2NX6MFZP8TM6S,6/29/08,1,1,1,"Way too much pepper (and salt and sugar and onion, oh my!)","First off, let's start with the product description for these cashews that appears on the product page: ""Lightly roasted with natural sea salt and a hint of pepper - Value added seasoning for the consumer who is tired of plain old cashews."" From reading that description, one would assume that these cashews have ""a hint of pepper."" That is not the case. These cashews are LOADED with pepper. When I first opened the container and saw these nuts, it looked like someone had wet them and dredged them in black pepper. And believe me...You can taste the pepper; and it stays with you. Very, very spicy. Too much so for me. I also agree with other reviewers who have said the nuts are too salty. WAY too salty, with 270mg of sodium in a single 1 oz. serving. Now, back to the ""value added seasoning"" description...Nowhere in the product description does it mention that these nuts have SUGAR added to them. Sugar? With salt and pepper? Add that to the ""granulated onion"" that also appears on the list of ingredients and maybe you can understand what I mean when I say that there's just a bit too much going on here flavorwise. You can't even taste the nuts!! I love cashews. And I love seasoned cashews. But these just don't make the grade. I think my biggest complaint is definitely the amount of pepper that are on these. It's WAY more than a ""hint."" Stay away from these nuts unless you want to make your taste buds very, very angry and give yourself some major heartburn."
08	65581,B001EQ55ZO,A108XP24UESKSV,6/29/08,1,1,3,Hold the pepper!,"After trying Emerald's Sea Salt & Pepper cashews, my household reached a general consensus. We would rather NOT have pepper on our cashews. While there were varying levels of dislike throughout the house, nobody really liked them. My sister thought they were disgusting. My dad, who LOVES cashews, will hardly touch them. I thought they were alright, but they're not something I'd want to eat a lot of.<br /><br />The pepper definitely adds a zest to the cashews. Whether that's good or bad... I guess it depends on your personal preference. If you love nuts & cashews, and you're tired of the same old thing, I'd suggest giving them a try. While I'd rather pass on the pepper, I did like the fact that they used sea salt, which is better for you (nutritionally) than regular old salt.<br /><br />I cautiously recommend this product to anyone who likes a bold flavor."
08	65582,B001EQ55ZO,ARFCORBCTKX1J,6/28/08,1,1,3,No improvement over the almonds...,"After Emerald's disappointing cocoa-powder covered almonds, I expected these to be better. If anything, they're slightly worse.<br /><br />Pepper seems a complementary taste for cashews. But there's too much pepper, and way too much salt. They smother the cashew taste. Though the cashews are of good quality (off-brands can be Really Lousy), their texture isn't quite as crisp as I'd like. (Granted, cashews aren't particularly crisp to begin with.)<br /><br />The cannister is nice -- ergonomic and sturdy. I can see buying this product simply to get the cannister to hold plain nuts or other snacks. (Lead balls, too.)<br /><br />Most nuts are sold ""plain"", with only a bit of garnishment (salt or mild spices), and for a good reason -- nuts taste good by themselves. They don't need enhancement. If Diamond (the ""synomymous with walnuts"" company that makes Emerald products) is trying to enhance their profits by ""enhancing"" their products, they're not doing it very well. I'd rather have a can of Planter's, thank you."

But this product seems designed for people who don't like the flavor of the nuts.<br /><br />Your mouth is hit with lots of saltiness first, quickly followed by warmth from the pepper. You can get the same experience by sprinkling some salt and pepper on your hand and licking the spices.<br /><br />No one could eat very many of these without a beer or other beverage that complements the saltiness and pepper.<br /><br />The package shows lots of perfect cashews, but my package contained more broken pieces and halves than complete cashews. The package needed to be filled more completely to avoid breakage in shipment. These don't look good enough to serve to guests.<br /><br />Stick to regular cashews!"
08	44602,B001EQ55RW,A2TI8XP8GY1RO1,6/25/08,0,0,3,Okay,"These nuts are okay.  They don't totally turn me away, but I don't find myself craving them at any particular point.  They aren't necessarily dessert-candidates either.  The taste is decent, nontheless."
08	24828,B000G0EP78,A1TZTVZWAMJWIO,11/17/08,10,10,4,Pretty good so far,"I've only really used this for pancakes so far (less one attempt at making chicken fingers - it was ok).  The pancakes are really pretty good.  I've used this recipe:  1/2c. mix, 1 egg, 1/4 tspn. baking powder (keeps it light), 1 1/2 tspn Splenda and enough liquid to reach normal batter consistency (start with 1/4 c. and add more if needed - cream and a little water is ok, but unsweetened soy milk is excellent for this).  Cook in liberal amount of butter and you shouldn't be disappointed.  Makes one really big pancake or several smaller ones!"

A better way is to get the book 'Carb Wars: Sugar is the New Fat' (ISBN 0979201802) and use the cooked gluten flour secret to make your own for much less money. (The Popovers are great!)"
08	65584,B001EQ55ZO,A33REC3J2JU2EL,6/25/08,1,1,5,Excellent with reservations,"My hubby loves salt and pepper anything and I had purchased other brands of Salt & Pepper Cashews in the past. He said that the Emerald were better at first: crunchier and had a more pronounced freshly-ground pepper taste. He said that they were much less salty than other brands he had tried.<br />Update:<br /><br />Unfortunately, after eating them a few times, he told me that the pepper taste was becoming overwhelming and he adores freshly ground pepper, he must eat about 5 times the amount I do on food. Maybe it was just that he was eating too much at once?<br /><br />I did notice that he went back to the Archer Farms brand that I had in the pantry, so I don't know if he'll be finishing the Emerald brand or not.<br /><br />If anything changes, I'll update my review again.<br /><br />I like the fact that the lid fits securely and they seem to stay fresh for a long time."

It takes a little experimentation to make recipes come out right, but once you do it is really good stuff. Adding cream and butter liberally helps make really good biscuits. My girlfriend also makes some great meat and Carbquik casseroles.<br /><br />Some people complain about it not being perfect but ITS LOW CARB BREAD. It tastes amazing when you don't have bread. Anything with a biscuit like texture will come out good and will be a joy to eat.<br /><br />I can only hope that they come out with more products like this. I love my food and this definitely helps me eat the dishes I crave while staying on a diabetic friendly diet."

Fortunately they are very useful. I keep some in a hardware drawer for nails, tacks, etc. I keep a dozen in a drawer next to the stove for loose herbs from my garden or spices bought bulk. The containers keep a good seal for freshness, yet are easy to open. I label the tops and keep a ""disposable"" plastic spoon inside each for measuring. If you can't use them, give them away ( Freecycle, Craigslist)."

08	24824,B000G0EP78,A1OKRUB89QJ0MV,1/3/08,14,14,5,Love this stuff,"I've used this many times over the past couple of years. Biscuits, breading for fried chicken, low carb brownies, etc. If you are following a low carb lifestyle, this is a great substitute for white flour-laden products. It does have a different taste, and a little aftertaste, but if you are doing the low carb thing, you're probably already familiar with that. I use this for anything I would usually use Bisquick for. I hadn't had a biscuit in over a year when I tried this...I was so glad I found it. Carbalose- the flour they use, is also available from some sites by itself- You can use this in even more recipes."
08	24823,B000G0EP78,A1A9PD00UVHHVI,1/3/08,44,51,4,Not Too Bad,"We tried this tonight for pizza crust. It really wasn't too bad, but there are some issues to be aware of if you are going to use it. The directions say add 1/3 cup of very hot water and mix to form a soft dough. No way does this happen. you have to get your hands in there and kind of work it all together and then it is pretty dry and crumbly. Kneading brings it together somewhat. As far as getting it in the pan, just be patient. Flatten it out as best you can and then start working from the center and press outwards. It takes a lot of work, but you can cover a 12 inch pan with it. It will be very thin though. I didn't find the flavor all that objectionable if you have a lot of toppings on it. I think the trick to all this low carb stuff is desperation anyway. Once you are on the diet long enough even cardboard tastes good. :0)"

I would recommend this product to anyone."
08	65586,B001EQ55ZO,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,6/25/08,1,1,5,Good nuts roasted and seasoned just right,These cashews are of a nice size and are very tender and flavorful.  The sea salt and pepper used to season them is a great touch.  I thought they were delicious and ate the whole can within three days!  I gave some to my mom and she found them too peppery.  I'm not a fan of spicy food and won't even buy medium salsa yet I didn't think the cashews were overly hot.  I would recommend these to anyone except those who are acutely sensitive to pepper in any amount and if you were you wouldn't be considering buying these anyway right?
08	65587,B001EQ55ZO,A3CWEK9HY2VPDL,6/24/08,1,1,4,"Maybe too much pepper, but a good flavorful snack","I think it's important to note that the ""pepper"" here is ground black pepper - not a spicy pepper like jalape&ntilde;os - something I didn't realize when I ordered these cashews.  But, no problem, I actually like black pepper.  And I think the combination works very well here, except that there's a bit too much pepper being used - the amount could probably be cut almost in half.  And the pepper is pretty strong, like freshly ground pepper, so it gives a good strong taste, but not so much that you don't taste the cashew.  I thought it kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the sea salt but as I shared some around the office others thought the product was a bit too salty (I'm something of a salt-aholic).  Nonetheless, everyone agreed that they're good enough to be slightly addicting.<br /><br />As with the other Emerald nuts, the cap makes a great measuring cup for a serving - if you can limit yourself to a single serving.  It's maybe not my first choice among the many excellent Emerald products, but a good snack for anyone who likes pepper."
08	65588,B001EQ55ZO,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6/24/08,1,1,4,Delicious in small doses!,"Emerald's Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews are top quality roasted nuts seasoned with a generous amount of black pepper and sea salt. What that means is the flavor here is very strong and spicy, and for those, like myself, who like strong flavored snacks, these are very good. However, you won't be able to eat more than a few at a time. The flavor is that strong. Of course, maybe that's better than a snack you continuously pop into your mouth until you've devoured the entire container. Some may say that the salt and pepper overpower the nut flavor here. I disagree, though the heat from the pepper definitely lingers. I'm going to give a thumbs up on this tasty product, but with a strong warning that if you don't like things hot and spicy, you won't like these. There probably is a smidge more salt and pepper than necessary, the only reason I'm not giving it the full 5 stars, so perhaps Emerald could take note of that and lighten the amount just a bit.<br /><br />As for the nutritional information:<br /><br />Calories - 160 per serving (120 from Fat), Total Fat 13g (saturated fat 2.5g, trans fat 0, polyunsaturated fat 2.5g, monounsaturated fat 8g), Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 270mg, Potassium 140mg, Total Carbohydrate 8g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 2g, Protein 4g, Calcium 2%, Iron 25%.<br /><br />Ingredients: Roasted Cashews (cashews, peanut and/or cottonseed oil), Sea Salt, Peanut Oil, Black Pepper, Maltodextrin, Sugar, Granulated Onion, Citric Acid, Spice, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />Allergy Info: This product is processed on equipment that also processes other tree nuts or peanuts.

There's a slight 'twang' after eating a handful of these, and they are great with a cold beer or soda. Each nut is big and bold, no little pieces in this jar. The packaging is great; good for taking along on trips. The twist lid is easy on and off. If you enjoy spice, go for these, the pepper does give a little extra kick."

If you're the kind of person who likes a little popcorn with their salt.....these might be for you. Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews are not for the faint of heart. This is a strongly seasoned snack. Lots of salt and lots of pepper. I really liked them, but I can see where they wouldn't be to some people's taste, and for God's sake! if you're on a sodium restricted diet, don't even be in the same room with these!"
08	65591,B001EQ55ZO,A1HOLJW15Q5S5V,6/23/08,1,1,5,Cashews with a KICK!,"I was a little bit leery of trying out cashews with pepper on them, but I was very pleasantly suprised.  The black pepper complements the cashews well and kicks up the taste a notch.  As with all the Emerald canister products, the quality is excellent, the canister is fashioned to fit in a car cup holder and the top is a handy measuring cup for a serving. I really enjoyed them."
08	65592,B001EQ55ZO,AGZEK96T7WK6,6/22/08,1,1,5,Fantastic - but you'd better love pepper!,"The combination of salt, pepper and cashew does work. I really wasn't sure what I was going to think of these but was intrigued at the idea of the pepper.  The first thing you taste is a lot of salt.  And then you taste a LOT of pepper, and I do mean a lot.  In fact, even though I love black pepper, my reaction to the first couple of nibbles was not very positive.  I put it aside and tried it again awhile later and found that the taste had ""grown"" on me.  I now can say honestly that I love these and could see myself choosing them over plain cashews on occasion.  My 10-year-old daughter, who likes spicy food but usually does not like a lot of black pepper, says these are ""awesome.""  I definitely would buy again."

I was thrilled when I searched on Amazon and found it!<br /><br />I bought this but didn't really realize I was buying a whole case! Lucky for me I love the stuff!  I drink the broth plain, use it to flavor rice, noodles, season meat, chicken etc.  It is such a versatile product that I'm glad I have the whole case!"

I wasn't sure about sea salt and pepper on cashews, but I think it is a good combination, too. The pepper slows me down on how fast I eat these, which makes me enjoy the flavor and taste more. While not an issue for my family, this product contains maltodextrin, which is sometimes made from wheat. As we are fans of wasabi peas, we have previously tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V99IZI"">Emerald Wasabi Bold Peanuts, 12-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12)</a>, but we like this flavor much better. I will buy this product again."
08	65594,B001EQ55ZO,AORGKBNQZ83O8,6/22/08,1,1,3,Less Really IS More,"Given that Salt & Pepper is my favorite potato chip flavor (specifically Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut for those who might be interested) and I love cashews, I was looking forward to trying these. Alas, once again, Emerald has managed to just miss the mark.<br />I like only enough salt in my food to enhance the taste, and the fact of the matter is that cashews are flavorful enough that not a whole lot is necessary. These nuts--which are nice and crisp and unbroken, no problem there--could easily lose 75% of their added salt and they'd be great, especially given that the black pepper used is of pretty good quality and kinda kicks in after everything has been eaten...if you can refrain from gulping your beverage of choice to slake the salt-induced thirst, that is. There's also some onion powder added, which would be a good thing if it were only discernible. But it's not because of the salt.<br />The lion's share of the nutritional data peeled off when I opened the canister, so I'm not able to provide them (I think I can be forgiven for not rifling through the garbage). Cashews are relatively low in fat for nuts, but they're not a low-cal food by any stretch of the imagination, plus these are roasted in peanut oil as well. I personally think nuts, plain or flavored, are a great source of nutrition but only if I can actually taste them.<br />In my experience, the single ingredient most common to mass-produced foods is salt, which seems a shame to me, especially since its misuse is so unhealthful. It's a lot easier to add salt to a dish than remove it, so if you're interested in actually tasting your food (and I think even simple, inexpensive food should and can be wonderful), let the manufacturers know. This product could easily be delicious if whoever formulated it would put a bit more finesse into it."

As if cashews weren't already perfect enough, the Emerald guys decided that ""nope; they need to be better""!  They've gone and packed a whole bunch more flavor into an affordable can of already scrumpcious cashews.  I'll admit every now & again you'll get a cashew so salty that your face'll contort into one of those stupid salt overload kinda faces, but those are few & far between.  The pepper adds a great flavor & a little heat at the tip of your tongue, it's literally unlike anything I've tasted on a cashew before, AWESOME!!!  Seriously, it was like god touched my mouth while eating these suckers.  Oh well, he giveth & he taketh away.  In the time it's taken me to write this review half of my stash is gone :(.

The picture shows some cashews lightly covered in pepper but when you open this up there is no light covoring.  These things are three times as smothered in salt and pepper than the picture depicts.  The taste was fantastic!  It added a lot of flavor to cashews and brought them to an entire new level.  They do have an after-taste, but it is a good aftertaste so you can enjoy them longer than they last in your mouth.<br /><br />Now this is all opinion, but I hope you can trust this lover of cashews.  How quickly they disappeared amongst coworkers should be further testament to their tastiness.  One of them even hunted me down asking for more.<br /><br />If you love cashews, at least give these a shot.  I haven't found anybody yet who didn't enjoy them."

I have never met a nut I didn't like, so of course I volunteered to try this new product. I looked at the container and thought, hey yeah, cashew snacks -- gotta be good, right?  Well not only are these GOOD, they are completely and utterly sublime. The blend of sea salt and pepper adds just the right spice to the cashew. I could eat this snack all night! It will add a little zip to an otherwise ho hum dish of nuts at a reception or party! I am currently trying to figure out how I could use them in another recipe -- say for instance, a chinese rice and cashew chicken entree????  YUM! Get some today!"

I personally prefer the liquid, as the powder can be difficult to dissolve properly, though it is more economical and easier to make in the amounts you need at any given time.  In my experience, kittens take to it well and don't suffer as many digestive issues as with some other brands.  I recommend a specially-designed formula such as Just-Born with colostrum for the first 2-3 days for kittens who are exclusively bottle-fed from birth, as the colostrum helps establish a newborn's immune system, which most formulas don't, but after the first few days, colostrum is merely broken down in the digestive tract and gives no added protection, so then it's time for KMR.  Follow feeding directions carefully and watch your little ones thrive on this superior formula!  It's never let us down."

No fragments or breakage, just nice, clean full leaves.<br /><br />Brews up just as nice as it looks, very smooth flavor, no bitterness at all.<br /><br />I recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a new tea brand, it will not disappoint!"

I've tried for years to like tea and every tea I've ever tasted was bitter or had some nasty after taste (some were just nasty from the get go). So when I had the opportunity to taste this tea I said why not, maybe this will be different, and sure enough it was.<br /><br />When you first open the container you are hit with this blast of fragrances, ranging from flower like scents, to sweet citrus, something I have NEVER had with tea. I guess I've been drinking (at least trying to drink) the wrong teas...<br /><br />I took a couple of pinches of the tea (about two teaspoons worth) and put it in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFPXYA"">Norpro Mesh Tea Ball with Cup Rest Handle</a>. After steeping the tea for a minute or so, I took my first taste and OH MY! It tasted nothing like any tea I have EVER had. No bitterness, after taste, or anything, just a very flavorful cup of tea. The citrus/orange flavor from the bergamot oil is extremely flavorful and aromatic, and again NOT the least bit bitter or harsh.<br /><br />If this is how tea is suppose to taste, I've been missing out for years and years and I am glad to say that I am not hooked on loose leaf teas. Move over coffee, I now have a new favorite warm beverage!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Extremely flavorful.<br />No bitter/harsh taste.<br />Organic (if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br />A fair trade product (again if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price, though compared to other loose leaf teas it's a pretty good price..."

After enjoying Leonidas in Germany (Aachen and Munich) for many years I placed an order here in New York State. What I received was (a) crudely presented boxes of (b) thick, hard-shelled (c) anonymous flavoured cream centres. With the exception of the coffee creams (which were more or less as I remember them from Europe) the rest of the box seemed to consist of two undefinable centres. Extremely disappointed with this order. The Godiva selection my mother received for Christmas was FAR superior in every respect -- packaging, presentation, appearance, texture, taste. I won't buy Leonidas in the USA again."

The best way to describe it is almonds lightly dusted with high quality bakers chocolate powder, but not as bitter as that would be.<br /><br />This is NOT a typical ""chocolate covered"" nut product.  The dusting of chocolate is very light.  If you're expecting a lot of sweet chocolate with a little nut inside you will be disappointed.  However, I have to say that this product is exactly what I've been looking for; a reasonable healthy source of both almonds and chocolate."

My dog Dingo, who is from a rescue in Taiwan, took to this pretty well. He really doesn't know what toys are but knows how to get food out. This toy is a bit trickier then the others but I heard (won't let me watch) him playing with this and I believe he has been able to get a few kibble bits out.<br /><br />I will update once I'm actually able to watch him. Until then I give this 3 stars."

He used to get upset when I left, but now he knows he will get this to play with.  He figured out really quickly how to use it and it keeps him entertained for at least 10-15 minutes while I escape.  It is very easy to clean.  One thing I wanted to point out is that the small is rather large.  My collie is huge and he uses the small.  I think the large would be too big for him.  I just put about a quarter of a cup in it although the small holds about 2 cups.  I guess if you wanted to feed a very large dog an huge meal you might need a large, but then it might be too heavey for the dog to play with."

I loved the fresh fragrant of the tea and it did not have a bitter taste if the leaves are steeped too long. Generous heap of tea and immediate off the boil water are a must to get the best out of the tea experience. Also, i would confirm that you do need to allow the tea to brew for 5 minutes before drinking. I normally like to steep the tea leaves several times, and in this case, I would suggest putting a few new leaves in.<br /><br />the tea leaves are neither diced nor sliced; and that I believe helps to keep the integrity of the flavor whole. This is a genuinely good quality product.<br /><br />I am keen to buy this for family to try as some tea smells better than it taste; not the case of this rishi jasmine tea. This is going to great after a good meal to help with the digestion."

08	21894,B000KV61FC,A2KXQHVDGURPRY,6/21/08,1,1,5,This thing is amazing!,"For the first couple of days, our dog Moby was only slightly interested in the tug-a-jug.  We kept it out, though, and when he finally figured out his own system of getting dog food out of the jug, he was hooked!  Then we started putting all his meals in the jug instead of in his bowl.  Since starting his meals in the jug, Moby has an outlet for his curious energy and he spends less time in the trash can and in distructive activities like toilet paper shredding because he has to work physically and mentally for his meals like animals do in the wild.  It also occupies him while we aren't at home.  It lasts so much longer than a kong, because you can put a whole meal in it.  This is also great because you don't have to feel guilty about giving your dog too many unhealthy treats -- dog food in the jug works great because the kibble is the perfect size.<br /><br />I was watching the video of the woman who put in a negative review, and as an amateur dog trainer, I think I know why.  If you help your dog get food out of the jug, they quickly learn that the way to get food out of the jug is to bring it to the owner, so don't help your dog -- that ruins the fun of the toy!  Also, it's harder to get treats out of the toy if it isn't somewhat full, so just fill it up with dog food and a few treats in the beginning so it's not so difficult that the dog looses interest.  It also helps to put a few treats in the jug so they randomly hit a jackpot when playing with it.  As someone who's studied animal behavior, I know random rewards are the most powerful way to get an animal addicted to a behavior!<br /><br />In short, I can't say enough about this toy!"
08	21895,B000KV61FC,A3EJRBPUFFECQP,6/7/08,1,1,3,Cute and entertaining,This bottle is big!  You can put lots of food in here which comes out a little too easy.  When I put treats in it's very difficult to get out and my husband thinks that's mean.  The dogs only like this toy when there are treats inside.  Otherwise I think they don't get the rope and the bottle is big and akward.

However, you should note that the rope probably won't last for heavy chewers.  I purchased small rubber balls at Pets Mart (2 or 3) and put them in the jug.  (opens at the bottom).  These actually work better than the rope for heavy chewers.  Thanks for a great product!"

I love the Tug-a-Jug because not only is it virtually indestructable, but it also keeps both of them challenged during their days home alone.<br /><br />I would agree with recommendations to fill the bottle high with small kibble to start with, until they get the hang of how to work it. Once they do, it is really fascinating to see how they learn and get better. The good thing is, even when they are getting treats, they are getting them sparingly so they continue to try for that one more.<br /><br />I have two Tug-a-Jugs and brought them outside a couple of times. They survived the frost and yard dragging very well. Inside the dogs do thump it against the floor pretty hard, so I would not use this on a nice wood floor, for example."

This is a wonderful alternative to the Buster Cube. I also have the small Twist and Treat and both are great toys to keep him occupied."

He's terrible about destroying soft toys. He's very active (he's a beagle!) and we needed something to keep his attention for more than a few seconds. This is it! What a winner! Wilson loves the tug a jug! At first he was puzzled by it. Of course, since he's a hound, he was following his nose, and his nose was telling him there was food in that jug but how in the heck was he supposed to get to it? He tried a few ways and then walked away frustrated. I showed him how the kibble would actually come out the hole and he was hooked. He spent half a day figuring it out. Sometimes I give him his entire meal in the tug-a -jug and let him work it out of there. He's a very high energy dog. He loves a challenge. I'm so grateful for this toy slash dogsitter!"

The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby."

He still hasn't learned exactly how the treats are dispensed, which is nice because I don't have to constantly refill the toy.  Tug-a-jug does not keep Weezer occupied for long stretches of time, but it entertains him for 15-30 minutes here or there.  It has held up fairly well, with just a few scratches on the plastic sides.  I put Cheerios into the tug-a-jug as a treats."

So it's not even the shipping that makes the price high.  It's good, but not enough to warrant paying the extra cost.<br /><br />And if you're looking to make Thai Iced Tea, don't follow the recipe on the label.

I did not have condensed milk though, so I had to use regular milk. I will admit you definitely need the condensed milk if you want it to be like the restaurant's style.

Thought this would be good for prolonging his mealtime and making it challenging for him.  Even though I put small dog food in, it was extremely difficult to get the food out.  He gave up after about 5 minutes.  Was disappointed in product."

If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican ""blends"" offered in stores and on the Internet).

They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."

My dog tends to eat fast, well this slows him down to a much more easy pace.  He loves carrying it around in his mouth he even brings it to me when it time to eat.  He has tried beating it up, but so far it has withstood all that he's tried.  Will buy again when the time comes for a new one"

This specialized indoor formula, made just for me because I am the most important being on earth, keeps me fit and healthy by reducing my fat intake. If I'm awake when Nathan get's home, I come rocketing into the kitchen to get my scoop of Purina Cat Chow. Sometimes I'm so hungry I can't contain myself and eat my food in a manner that is, uh, well let's just say it's not always dignified.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish that there were a few more pounds of food in that bag, as I have to send Nathan out to get me more on bi-weekly basis. That's ok though, as he is here to serve me. I've been pestering him to write this review for a while now, and it's good to know that other supreme beings like myself might benefit from my thoughts.<br /><br />If you, like me, enjoy these tasty grains, you might also like to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JUPOS"">Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold Savory Chicken and Turkey Formula</a>.<br /><br />Oliver<br />Expert Cat Food Reviewer"

Honestly, it smells like horse doo.  Whenever she jumps in my lap after eating this stuff, it about makes me gag!  It has to be the strangest smelling cat food I've ever used, which is why I wanted to write this review.  Just thought it was rather strange. I don't plan on buying it again because of that - the smell is Blech!  It isn't her favorite food, but it's tolerable, especially if mixed with a little meat.  The protein content isn't as high, only 30% because it's for the indoor cat.  I would recommend it for that reason because it does help with the weight factor. Just be careful,your nose will have to be made of steel to get past the smell!"
08	7714,B001E5DZTS,A1V90LL2U9Q074,8/27/08,1,1,5,Excellent for babies who are allergic to dairy. And WAY better than the toxic formulas.,my daughter is allergic to all dairy and cannot have all the extra iron they pump into the poisness formulas that they say are sooo healthy for your babies growth. this goats milk gives her all the nutrients that she needs. i would suggest to any mother even if the baby is not allergic to dairy.

It is strong and it will get bitter if the brewing temperature is too high--so don't let the water boil!  My husband and I have been drinking this tea for years now, and while we've tried much more expensive teas such as Teavana, we keep coming back to this over and over.  It's our favorite and if it's brewed just right it has a tangy, smoky complexity that's just unbeatable.  I always get sick of drinking other teas after awhile, but I never, ever get tired of this one.  I drink it throughout the day--it's good hot or iced.  How nice to find it on Amazon in bulk."

The rope is not actually a rope, it's a plastic mimic of a rope and my dog can't seem to figure out that he can tug at it like he can his tug rope. He quickly figured out all the other busy buddy toys and the buster cube, so I assume the rope just seems too foreign. I am going to buy an actual tug tope that will fit and try that instead. Will update review once I do this."

08	18922,B000F4H5FE,A2D9FPXXCR2VBW,1/24/08,3,3,5,Good green tea,"This is a basic, good green tea.  I use enough for a 4-cup batch, but use only water for 1-cup.  In this way, I can drink a condensed form of it at my work desk all day long.  This keeps me from sneaking into the coffee room and getting my caffeine only from coffee sources.  Not that this is bad (my company gets the best coffee in the world), but all too often there are high-calorie or high-salt snacks lurking in the coffee room, just waiting for you to bounce in there!  Yikes!!  And you always fall for it:  I don't care who you are or how steeled your thoughts are against taking any ""free"" coffee-room snacks.<br /><br />Getting back to the tea.  This gunpowder green tea tastes great and it is entertaining too.  The ""gunpowder"" is rolled up little balls of tea leaves, and if you make this in clear glass you can watch them unroll (explode, like gunpowder).  This isn't the highest quality, but the price is right and it tastes good.  Perfect for your average normal day.  For that, I give it 5 stars."

She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough.  When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces.  While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does.  Especially for eleven dollars!"

No more stuffing bags in our pockets for walkies!<br /><br />I can see why one of the other reviewers didn't like the hard plastic tie that attaches the dispenser to the leash handle, but we just cut the excess off right down to the locking tab and it hasn't scratched our hands.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
08	38970,B001FKA84C,A2HA3J9HYZZZEY,4/10/08,0,0,1,Not easy to open,If you don't have a lot of hand strength it's not the right container to get.  The lid is pretty much impossible to get off if the plastic is cold.  It gets very frustrating to have to wait for someone else to get the lid off for you.  The bags themselves are great though.  I think the bone shaped one might be easier to use and will probably give that one a shot.
08	38969,B001FKA84C,ARDBQB9AIUQWL,9/7/08,0,0,5,What great idea,This is cutest thing and it's so convenient to clip onto my dog's leash when we walk. I love it.
08	65770,B001EQ4J42,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,8/1/08,12,14,4,A good Choice,"When I'm drinking instant coffee, Taster's Choice has for years been my beverage of choice.  Coffee snobs may turn up their noses at instant coffee; and it's true that nothing beats a well-brewed cup of freshly made java.  But sometimes speed is of the essence and all you really need is a smooth, solid mug.  Of all the instant coffees I've tried, this one is the best.<br /><br />The coffee itself has a very nice, rich flavor.  It is instant coffee, so don't be expecting the greatest cup of Joe, but compared to other instant coffee brands Taster's Choice is by far the most appealing.  I take mine with a little bit of milk or half and half (whatever I've got in the fridge) because I tend to find the coffee a little bit too bitter when it's black.<br /><br />One change that I've noticed and disliked in the last few years has nothing to do with the coffee crystals but is in the container.  For years, this coffee was sold in a nicely shaped glass jar with a solid metal lid sealing in the flavor.  Nowadays Nescaf&eacute; distributes their coffee in a tall plastic container.  My objection to the change is not based on aesthetics (although the look and feel of the original is far preferable to the modern plastic abomination), but rather how fresh the product stays.<br /><br />In the glass container, I could have the coffee crystals sitting around for months and they would be just the same as they were when the jar was new.  But with the plastic container, I find that it simply doesn't do as good a job as the glass for keeping the crystals dry and fresh.  Very often, as the weeks and months go by, the crystals start getting damp and clumping together forcing me to break up large chunks of coffee crystal lumps, something which never occurred in the glass container.<br /><br />To solve this problem, I ended up finding an old Nescaf&eacute; Taster's Choice glass jar and simply reusing that one over and over again.  Every time I need a refill, I wash out the old jar and fill it with the coffee I bought in the plastic container.  I'd like to think that Nescaf&eacute; is still producing the glass jars somewhere, but if so I've haven't found them.<br /><br />For instant coffee that actually tastes like coffee, I've been happy with Taster's Choice.  It's not what I turn to when I want an absolutely fantastic tasting, 100% pure, guaranteed to knock your socks off and touch the face of God cup of coffee, but it is what I choose when I want something right now."

The ball comes in two sizes, 6"" and 8"".  The 6"" is the size of a softball and the 8"" is about as large as a bowling ball. I have both. The larger one is the favorite. The balls are hollow ,squishy, not too heavy, and the rope is the sturdiest I've seen. I highly reccomend this toy for it's durability and versitility, as it can be tossed, rolled, tugged and chewed."

The aroma that escaped upwards from the can was heavenly; delicate, alluring, definitely Earl Grey but with whispers of bergamot, a lemony, citrusy warmth that made me feel good immediately. I put aside all other endeavours for a time and gave myself up to a retreat with this wonderful light tea. Don't brew it more than 4 minutes; let the essence of the bergamot exude from the tea. Both your sense of taste and your sense of smell will be the better for having indulged in this tea. A lovely cap on a grey, ugly day.<br /><br />Rishi Earl Grey Tea is 100% Organic Fair Trade tea, grown by and harvested by the ethnic peoples of the Yunnan Province of China from tea trees planted in 696 A.D. By buying Fair Trade teas, the minority peoples who grow the tea benefit, through community developments and direct trade. The benefit to the purchaser is in knowing that they are doing a good thing for the earth and for the small farmer. I've just started seeing Fair Trade items coming onto the market, and I try to patronize the small farmer. You won't be cutting any corners by drinking this tea; it's truly a great beverage. It also says on the can that one serving can be used multiple times, so don't cavalierly throw it out after the first cup. Very recommended."

She's a rough-and-tumbler to be sure, but they claimed it was indestructible. Hardly.<br /><br />Pity too, she'd almost learned how to use it."

My Border collie chewed the rope out too- to make it more challenging then just knocking it over and treats spilling out really easy, I put a smaller sized tennis ball inside so she still has to work the bottle back and forth in order to get the treats to go from the back of the bottle to the neck.

08	21957,B000KV61FC,A58F10T4OE58C,1/9/08,5,5,5,Great toy but frustrates my dog,"This toy keeps our Boston Terrier entertained for a long time.  We don't give it to her all the time to keep it new and interesting.  It is not easy to get the food out of the toy, which really frustrates her.  She'll start barking at it and going at it harder.  Other reviewers said their dogs got the hang of it quickly and were able to ""beat"" the system, but I don't see that happening with our dog.  It is still a bit of randomness with how the food comes out, so what worked for the dog one time, might not the next.  You can make it harder or easier depending on the size and shape of food you use."
08	35781,B000O7IVKK,A3LH252XUN463T,8/17/08,1,2,5,5 Star Organic value for a classic side dish,"The move to going organic needs to be a smooth transition, especially when you are cooking for more than one person.  Breaking the barrier of ""ewe organic, I don't know..."" can be easier if you don't go wild on the switch to organic. That being said, this Kraft Organic Macaroni & Cheese is a good start. Tastes just like the real thing.  If you don't believe me, just slap down a buck at you local grocery store and just give it a shot. You wont find it on sale with a coupon (yet) but it will help you and your family start making moves toward replacing some of your food with Organic.<br /><br />What I shoot for is less of the extra food additives with the bonus of organic farming of wheat and milk. It still comes in a cardboard box and a semi-foil cheese bag of flavor, but hey you got to start somewhere. Just recycle the box and enjoy one of your favorite side dishes.  Once you try the first box, you'll know that you will have no problems finishing off the case sold here.<br /><br />Oh, just an FYI. I found out on my own (by opening the box and comparing the semi-foil cheese bags of flavor) that the Organic Back to Nature Mac&Cheese has the exact same bag of cheese. Right down to the same serial number.  I would bet the pasta is the same too."
08	35782,B000O7IVKK,A2IUDDQNI7Y3ZM,6/24/08,1,2,2,Tastes bitter,"Mac n Cheese makes a great late night meal, and it's great comfort food. I picked up a couple boxes of the new Organic version, assuming it would taste the same. The first box tasted so bitter that I had to toss it all. I thought maybe I had a bad box, so I gave it another try, but it still tastes disgusting. Has anyone else noticed this?"
08	38942,B000V6HQPU,A1SGS3TIPTMHWI,12/4/08,2,4,5,Good stuff,"Great for a soup from a can.  Full of flavor and spice but if you don't like spicy stuff, stay away from this one."
08	80778,B000E1BKJK,ACELC7PJJLJGP,4/5/08,7,8,5,Awesome,"There's just something about Tapioca Pudding that makes me happy.  Definitely my favorite.  Until recently, I would just buy the Kozy Shack pre packaged tapioca pudding from the grocery in the refrigerated section; however, it has risen in price to the point where it is much more economical to make the cook and serve Jell-o brand, which tastes fresher and can be served warm or cold (or frozen in an ice tray similar to pudding pops (or poppers).  Also, no more worrying about the expiration date like you do with the refrigerated ones.<br /><br />When purchased from Amazon via their promo sales, you can get a package of this for .50.  Add in the price of 2 cups of milk (another .50), and you've made 4 servings of this for $1.  Definitely a bargain!"

However, I did notice the absence of any chemical taste. I wish it had a sharper cheddar taste, however. The taste of the cheese is quite mild. The macaroni is quite light in quality I note."

08	48324,B000EVLS2E,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,10/22/08,4,4,5,Great Snack,"I haven't tried using it as a breakfast cereal, but its a great, healthy snack and alternative to junk food. I eat it straight out of the bag. It definitely is not something that you would compare to one of those sugar-laden breakfast foods. It has more of the texture of popcorn than of a breakfast cereal. Highly recommended."
08	35814,B000LKXJEI,A3HX1AL08JX9VI,8/24/08,0,0,5,Absolutely a very delicious snack!,A fantastic handy snack high in protein.  Healthy and so delicious you will want to eat the whole bag!
08	35815,B000LKXJEI,A2QUIWIJEXAS5M,8/12/08,0,0,5,Really Tasty,These are really tasty and make a great high protein snack.  I order them regularly and keep them in my desk drawer.  They are really filling and taste great.
08	29505,B000PDY3P0,A2S7XE53NQ2ODI,6/3/08,3,3,5,Good stuff,"I received a popcorn machine for my birthday and I have not been able to find the right combination to make popcorn that tastes like you get at the movies.  The local convienence store always has great popcorn and I happened to notice they use this.  I just went through a case in less than a month! It is good stuff!  The 8 oz size is a bit much for my family of four, so I will go with the 6 oz this time.  I ordered two cases this time!"
08	35816,B000LKXJEI,A3BSVEVBV9RZS2,7/20/08,0,0,5,Great Flavor Even fooled meat eaters,"Based on reviews online for vegan snacks, I tried this particular flavor and love them. Great snack for the road. They are mostly Wheat gluten in case you want to limit your soy intake. My friends who eat animals loved them also. I didn't mention what they were made of until they were finished eating them and asked. Nice chewy texture. These travel well. They have 10 Gms of protein in case you are asked ""where do you get your protein?"" I plan on trying another flvor."
08	44604,B001EQ55RW,A1A043A4JU4T7B,6/25/08,0,0,5,Subtly Sweet,"These nuts have just a touch of chocolate sweetness to them, really just a whisper of dark chocolate flavor, more chocolate than sweet, but it makes them better than just regular almonds, in my opinion.  I was pleasantly surprised by these nuts, and would highly recommend them.  A very refreshing afternoon or evening snack!"
08	72787,B001ET5Y52,A5ALUPAO0QPAG,8/28/08,2,2,5,Great taste and value,"Since we use a great amount of prunes, Newman's Own Organics Organic California Prunes, Pitted, 12-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6), are excellent for us. I can't find six 12-ounce single packs anywhere for the price I pay for the six-pack here. We just started on our second six-pack and so far have only found one pit. Which is excellent; the brand I used to buy wasn't pitted very well and I had to be very careful of my teeth. This is definitely a good deal for us especially, when I add something else to my order which brings it to the amount that qualifies for free shipping."
08	35817,B000LKXJEI,A2IKX7H2PLHULP,5/24/08,0,0,5,10 grams of protein in 90 calories!,"These things are great - I discovered them at Whole Foods and now I can get them even cheaper here at Amazon with quick shipping to boot. These are great for traveling, hiking/outdoors stuff, and to bring to work for a snack. They don't need to be refrigerated, and they're vegan as well! They're made of wheat gluten, which is very high protein. I like the thai peanut flavor the best - I've tried BBQ and teriyaki and I don't like them as much."

08	65889,B0007A0AQW,A3W37DL6P9WZHC,12/13/08,15,17,3,Dog likes them!,"My dog likes these treats, but definitely prefers the peanut butter ones better.  One strange thing I've noticed with these treats is that they tend to harden very quickly -- so you're best off buying the small bag (seen here), not the bigger bag.  It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor.  But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small.  They're perfect for training, and Zuke's is always full of good things, not some crappy ingredients like some other dog treats out there."
08	72775,B001ET5Y52,A1RAHXIOGKKUID,6/8/08,3,3,5,Delicious and fresh,"These arrived quickly and were very fresh and soft.  Our whole family really likes them and in fact, it's hard not to eat too many.  We have had problems in the past getting prunes that we couldn't make into prune butter if we wanted to (for lowfat baking) but these would certainly work very well."
08	72774,B001ET5Y52,A17YYKMUEEDP88,12/11/08,3,3,5,Good for your health!!,"This prunes are delicious and full of antioxidants. Don't forget about fibre which is good for your bowel movement as well. For the taste, it's not too sweet and not to dried -- I liked it!"
08	65892,B0007A0AQW,A18GRFBPQO1I17,12/21/08,31,43,5,Good treats!,"Our puppy loves these little treats! They are small enough to give him a few at a time, but I like to cut them up even smaller and use them for training. They are tiny as is (about the size of a pencil eraser), but can easily be cut into quarters for reward-based training. I will always keep these in stock for him!"

At least a couple of chips per bag.  The other brands (not organic) never have chips of pitts in them.<br /><br />Amazon: great!<br />Newman's Organic Prunes: OK (three stars and not more).<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dave Weekley"
08	72762,B001ET5Y52,A1VE1GGV2HDPG8,3/29/08,5,5,5,Wonderful,"I'm not an expert on prunes, in fact I can't remember the last time I bought or ate any.  But this product made a prune lover out of me.  They are moist and sweet but not overly.  A word of caution, beware of small bits of pit, so far it hasn't been common place, but boy does it ever put a halt to your chewing when you do bite down on a piece.  So far no lost fillings but sure gave me a fright, chewing more slowing now."
08	80766,B000E1BKJA,AKND6XZ7CO5EF,3/26/08,0,0,5,"Very rich, but good...","Bought this due to tempting reviews.  It is good but I find a little bit goes a long way as it is very rich.  In fact, our favorite way to have it is frozen and in small quantities.  We think of it more like candy when eaten this way but find a small piece is all we need at any one sitting.  A nice ""treat"" after dinner to satisfy one's sweet tooth."
08	72757,B001ET5Y52,A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR,7/24/08,8,8,4,"good taste, but a little tough at times","I don't know if I got a ""bad"" batch or maybe just have odd standards of my own. Hmmm. I'm used to eating Sunsweet prunes, and they're sweeter and softer than these organic ones.<br /><br />I like that these are not so sweet, but sometimes I find them a bit tough, and I wish I weren't eating them straight from the bag but instead cooking them with oatmeal or something like that.<br /><br />I don't use them for any real physical problem or challenge; I've always really liked prunes in general. My dad needs these for regularity, and I must say they've been really good for him. Better than the generic or Sunsweet ones we used to get for him. Dunno why that is, but it is.<br /><br />Anyway--solid four-star rating.<br /><br />Ooo, little tip--put a few in a food processor and mince them up, then use them as a spread on toasted whole wheat or whole grain bread. Yummy!"
08	35852,B000LKXJEI,A1RMYTOAF6FXM6,10/15/08,15,16,5,Awesome Food!,I bought two strips of this before I went backpacking. While on the trail I decided to break out my snack not knowing what to expect. This stuff is awesome! I shared with my sister who is not a vegan and she liked it too! Great protein boost! Great flavor! Great texture!
08	35855,B000LKXJEI,A3J4NARZK4Q4PX,10/20/08,7,8,5,Suprisingly yummy...great texture!,"My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other brands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! These are yummy! Great texture & flavor. Great ingredients too! We will be stocking up on these as a healthy, convenient protein packed snack."
08	35856,B000LKXJEI,A221633P5RKKQ6,8/19/08,6,7,5,Great Vegan food!,"These jerky strips are delicious!  I've been a vegetarian for 13 years and I'm always looking for tasty vegetarian ""meat replacement"" foods.  These strips definitely work for me. I keep a couple in my car to snack on when I don't have time to stop and eat.  The texture is so ""meat-like"" you will question yourself and re-read the ingredients to be sure is isn't made from animal flesh. I bought a case of the Texas BBQ and a case of the Hickory Smoked.  They are both fantastic, and the Texas BBQ has a nice spicy kick! I think you'll really enjoy this product. I do. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZD4W"">Primal Spirit Vegan Meat Alternative Jerky, Texas Barbecue Flavor, 1-Ounce Pouch  (Pack of 24)</a>"

Beef jerky is a great snack if you are on the go (I travel a lot), but the constant intake of red meat is not good for you.  So, I tried the Primal Strip vegan strips.  I have had every one that they make.....and they are all good.  The Thai Satian Peanut is by far my favorite (the hot and spicy shiitake mushroom jerky is my second favorite).  I have recommended this snack to even the most devout meat eaters and they even like it.  I give it 5 stars - but just like everything - they are not for everyone.  I recommend buying them individually first, and if you love it then come back to amazon and get a box (amazon is the cheapest for the boxes)."
08	35861,B000LKXJEI,AK3YI0DS8E4L7,1/10/08,3,3,5,Vegan-licious,"This Hickory Smoked flavor is my favorite of the Primal Strips lot. The strips are moist, tender, unusually flavorful, and just the right size. Even my carnivorous relatives in Wisconsin took to these Strips. My only outstanding concern is that Primal Strips are manufactured in Taiwan, which  means their production is outside the domain of US food safety and inspection. However, having consumed over two dozen of these strips in the past month, I remain happy and healthy."

The cocoa is more an evocation of chocolate than a candy experience. There's not too much sweetness, just a hint of cocoa.<br />This means your hands won't be messy when you eat them. That fact, together with the container's screw-top lid, makes these great for the car, camping, and keeping near your computer."
08	80763,B000E1BKJA,AQV9H0MSRGUA,10/29/08,2,2,5,Yummy Dessert!,This is the best dessert ever and so easy to make.  Great for all ages.  Tastes like real peanut butter.
08	51296,B000F4F96G,AVYV7GG3JUKT3,1/6/08,1,1,4,Nice medium flavor,Could use a slightly stronger vanilla flavor. It is a medium strength at this time. No funny aftertaste.  Very good with milk.
08	44606,B001EQ55RW,A4UFU4WKYEUGO,6/18/08,0,0,3,Really not what I expected,"These are chocolate dusted, not 'coated', hence they are a bit drier than I would have liked. I have noticed that other people like these, most particularly my Filipino relatives. The taste is good - it's the consistency of the almond that didn't appeal to me. They are a bit tougher than what I am used to, therefore they are a bit hard to snack on. However, if you are intent on loosing weight this would appear to be the combination for you. They are not extremely salty, which makes for nice, trim ankles, and the chocolate is of the kind that does not contribute to FAT (which I have too much of thank you very much). So they are worth a try :)"
08	12305,B0009XQSAY,A3CON26JT9UT80,8/11/08,5,7,3,Damaged goods,"At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK."

08	35870,B000LKXJEI,A1C0UCSKLZR0I9,5/16/08,2,2,5,Vegetarian and Very Tasty,I have searched for a good vegetarian jerky for several years.  There have been some hits but more misses.  This is one of the best; a great BBQ flavor and a consistency similar to real jerky.  Definitely worth trying.
08	35871,B000LKXJEI,A3O8Q6J5O5RB6Q,2/29/08,2,2,5,Awesome veggie snacki,"I absolutely love this stuff -- the mesquite lime flavor is sweet, spicy and tangy, and the consistency of the jerky is chewy yet moist. At 74 calories and 10 grams of cholesterol-free meatless protein, you can't beat it as a snack."
08	72727,B0001DR2BG,A3C27OW529FH54,9/6/08,0,0,5,the best,"It is simply the best soda, better than Nehi but as the others say, too expensive(as of this review)on Amazon, get it locally by asking grocer to order cases for you. Best taste in my opinion is Grape, Black Cherry and Ginger Ale. You will not drink any other soda after tasting this stuff!"
08	54835,B0002VLEUW,A3O646NL6SH3ZL,2/2/08,1,1,5,The absolute best!,"I'm up in years so I remember my mom making peach preserves. These are just as good. The consistency is spot on and the taste intensely peach.<br /><br />Unlike the Tangerine, the Peach is worth the $$."
08	35872,B000LKXJEI,AKQZNFVEURYYO,2/6/08,2,2,5,Great snack and 10g of protein in 74 calories!,"This is my favorite flavor from Primal Strips.  I like the others but ordered this one last since it sounded weird, but it's great.  The lime flavor is strong and their texture is very good (moist and chewy).  Lowest calories (same as Thai Peanut) from their line.  An excellent no-guilt snack!"
08	72723,B000PKL568,A1V8UMNTKNAF3I,1/18/08,1,1,5,Great quality,This chicken was a gift and it arrived on time and was well liked. Fast service and good quality.
08	89266,B0001KCV5G,A1Z1B18OC33CD0,1/11/08,2,2,5,Fabulous (but pricey),Looking for something special on your english muffin Sunday morning?  This is it.  The tangy flavor of cranberries sweatened and mellowed with Cointreau... hmmmm!  Use something good but ordinary during the week like Smuckers strawberry and you'll really appreciate the difference.
08	58651,B0013P3KC6,A2SUWSNZP5OJ7T,10/13/08,28,29,4,xylitol,"As described by other reviewers, I just wanted to add in response to an above revie, I have successfully used this with a yeast recipe. All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe. This will add about 4 grams of total sugar to the recipe."
08	35886,B000LKXJEI,ASP4CRYVPOSBG,7/31/08,1,1,5,They are totally awesome!,"I've eaten these for a long time, and they are totally awesome, though not always easy to get hold of (they run out).  Great protein source for a busy vegan like me, plus I am a fitness trainer and workout a lot, so I need the convenient protein. Personally I think mesquite lime is the best, flavor wise, of all the Primal Strips, but they are all good.  My hubby loves the barbecue ones."
08	38896,B001ELL6KM,A2RGPO7OK492XR,6/25/08,4,5,4,Polenta,"Living a rural area, I have a hard time finding any version of polenta.  This was a lifesaver!  The reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does tend to be a little mushier than traditional polenta, and although labeled as microwaveable, boiled over every time!"
08	35887,B000LKXJEI,AXQIHSF9KK7CO,6/10/08,1,1,5,Vegetarian Staple,"This product is a must have because it is a way for vegetarians to be able to have protein while on the go, and also for anyone whose physician has recommended additional protein intake, especially throughout the day.  The convenience is great and the flavor of this product is super.  I really enjoy it."

08	35888,B000LKXJEI,A3T6GMR57Z4NXG,3/7/08,1,1,5,A Very Satisfying Snack,"I love Primal Spirit Jerky.  I've tried several different flavors and some appealed more than others but, as a previous reviewer noted, that was more personal taste than because of any deficiency in product.  This is a very tasty snack that you can really sink your teeth into.  My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and breakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat-alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.  Definitely going to order some of these now...Yum!"

I tried the Arrowhead Mills Yellow Organic Grits.  They are quite good.  Creamy, excellent flavor - among the best I have found in yellow grits.  I'm a Southerner and heartily recommend this product."

It is also one of the better tasting honeys in its category. It is indeed 100% natural raw honey, which is obviously never heated, filtered or strained; hence preserving all the natural vitamins, minerals, enzymes and antioxidants found in honey. The fact that the producers decided to add pollen, propolis, and crushed honeycomb to the jar is also brilliant. Eat two table spoons of this honey everyday, I swear your life span will go up by several years. This honey is simply incredible, what a great gift from mother nature!<br /><br />The jars are also very cute. At the cost of a very reasonable shipping price, I have received my first two jars within 36 hours in perfect shape after my order. Thanks for the super fast shipping Wee-Bee.<br /><br />Don't waste this honey by spreading it on your toast or in your tea. Eat it up all by itself from the jar whenever you feel like it. This is beyond your standard honey, which is totally spoiled by heating and filtering -thanks to the profit oriented industrialists in the honey business. Wee-Bee honey is the real deal, and it is very reasonably priced. What a piece of heaven! I can't wait to order more. Thank you Wee Bee!"

It has lots of oats, as well as other grains and chopped nuts and dried fruit.<br /><br />I add some more stuff (walnut pieces, almonds, hazel nuts if I can get them, and raw cashews, along with extra raisins) and keep it in a plastic container.  Usually for breakfast at work I will line a plastic container with plain yogurt, then put in a helping of Familia, then fresh fruit, maybe bananas, apples, or peaches, and maybe a little nutmeg or cinammon for variety.<br /><br />This is living!  And it's excellent for your health!  I'm tickled that Amazon carries this, because it's harder to get in stores than previously."

These are great!!<br /><br />They have great Cocoa flavor that doesn't cover up the wonderful flavor of the nuts themselves. The  combination of  dark chocolate and expertly roasted nuts makes for a great satisfying snack that isn't too sweet and just right.<br /><br />These are not chocolate coated, but have a fine dusting of cocoa powder/cocoa flavoring that makes them satisfying and delicious!"

This is also a much healthier pasta than the average with 28g protein per half pound box. It's just amazing the flavor in this dish - when served simply with olive oil and garlic you can really get the flavor of an artichoke with the contrast of bitter taste and sweet aftertaste. Likewise it stands up to a full red or white sauce also.<br /><br />1 disclaimer: by no fault of the pasta manufacturer Amazon once sent me a box of pasta that had passed it's expiration date so just make sure to check the lot date on the side of the box and the end of all the individual packets.

She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No ""doggie junk food"" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor.  They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again."

If you get it from this place, you pay $26 (TWENTY SIX!) for shipping and handling. Why? All I found was a freezer pack! What a ripoff. When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled ""specially selected for Wegman's."" Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's."

They're great breakfast bars if you're on the go and don't have time to prepare a meal.  I keep a box at work for times when I need a little pick me up during the day.  The blueberry flavor is sweet, and the bars don't have that chalky taste like others I've tried."

If you have a sweet tooth and want something that is healthy in comparison to eating a candy bar, then you might like these Special K bars.<br /><br />I will probably go back to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007LXU86"">Kashi GOLEAN Bar, Chocolate Almond Toffee, 2.75-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, which seem to be more nutritious on the whole.

These white meat chunk chicken in cans are great, because I'm terrible at meal planning.  All of a sudden, I'll be hungry NOW, with no time to cook.<br /><br />So I open a can of this Swanson chicken, drain it, dump it into a tupperware, add a couple heaping tablespoons of lite Miracle Whip, and start mashing at the chunks with a fork.  I scoop up the newly made chicken salad with saltine, Ritz, or butter club crackers.  Ta-da, instant protein-filled meal.  This chicken would be great for serving to kids, too.  I ALWAYS have cans of this in my cupboards.  I can add some more flavor by adding ground black pepper, mustard, relish, and other kitchen staples.<br /><br />It is cheaper at my local stores.  But, if you can't get out to the store, I've always had great service from amazon!"
08	38850,B000ICO8GW,A3AS6GPT7RKHF5,4/18/08,1,1,2,Vending machine coffee tastes better,"I can't say I'd recommend this coffee.  If not for the convenience, I wouldn't ever have rebought it, but now I've found a better choice for regular coffee in the Tassimo - either Starbucks Breakfast Blend, or Jacobs Kronung.  Both beat this coffee hands down in flavor.  The Jacobs doesn't make as much coffee though.<br />This coffee tastes like vending machine coffee at a highway rest stop - the kind from a machine that hasn't been tended to recently.  Thin and yucky.  Sorry, Gevalia fans.  They make a good espresso, though, and the latte and cappuccino choices are much better.<br />Pass on this one if you're not sure and try one of the others."

However, if you want a tasty snack with a subtle chocolate flavor, Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds might be just right.<br /><br />Nuts are one of my favorite snacks, although I usually eat raw almonds or pecans rather than roasted nuts. The dry roasting gives these almonds a nice toasty flavor and extra crunch, and the cocoa powder adds just a hint of chocolate. A small handful of almonds make a nice between-meals snack to take the edge off any hunger pangs.<br /><br />Do have a glass of water handy while eating these. The dry roasting and dusting of cocoa powder make them especially dry, and you will want something to drink with them.<br /><br />I liked these so much I have already bought more. I plan to keep a supply on hand for those mid-afternoon munchies. A handful of cocoa roast almonds make a more healthful snack than a candy bar or chips."

The only thing I'll warn against is that they can harden up within a few weeks.  So, I would suggest buying more of the smaller bags as opposed to the 1 pound bigger bag that they sell, unless you have several dogs and will go through these pretty quickly."

My dog loves it, and I give it to her as a reward for staying while being groomed, or pooping and peeing outside. She always wants more. Of course I only give her 2 at a time. These would last forever since there are so many in a bag. Amazon has these for like $3 something, great for getting up to $25 free shipping thresh hold too. My dog loves these and they do not irratate her stomach in any way as the ingredients are natural, meaty, no filler and healthy for her. The treats themselvesa re moist and smells like meat. Dogs do love moist treats more than dry treats, so the yare great for training. Highly recommend it."

Unfortunately, when I received my order 10 of the 12 cans were severely damaged. If I saw cans in this condition in a grocery store I wouldn't buy them for any price. Amazon needs to figure out how to ship their canned goods safely. Hopefully Amazon will refund my money, but needless to say, I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Update July 2011<br /><br />I have ordered this chowder from Amazon 2 additional times (I just can't find the smaller cans anywhere). Anyway, the order I received early this year still had many dented and squashed cans but they weren't as badly damaged as the first time.<br /><br />I then placed another order at the end of June and miracle of miracles not a singe can was damaged in any way. The packaging was exactly the same as the first 2 orders, but this time it was shipped by Ensenda instead of UPS.

If you have also had this experience, then you need to look no further, since these almonds covered in dark chocolate powder perfectly combine the flavor of the two ingredients. Not to mention that you avoid consuming the saturated fat present in regular chocolate covered almonds.<br /><br />I am hooked, and will keep consuming this product for as long as I can find it!"

He usually turns his nose up at most things.  Although it took a few sniffs to get him to try them, he now loves these.  We just used them to teach him to shake hands, and it took less than a day for him to learn his new trick with the Zuke's.  I would definitely recommend these.  (BTW, we also tried the beef Z filets, which he also loves)."

However, you can turn a good treat into a great treat by getting a little creative!  That is where these Cocoa Roast Almonds come into play -- they are the perfect ""summertime topper treat""!<br /><br />Now I'm not like most people, and don't like eating nuts just ""plain"" -- I prefer them to be mixed in with something.  Now that summer is here ice cream and cool treats are the order of the day, and as I found out a bowl of vanilla ice cream with a scoop of these Cocoa Almonds is one of summer's finer pleasures!<br /><br />These almonds are absolutely delicious and just a tad bit on the salty side at times (or so I think), which makes them a good addition to other foods.  Have you ever tried a pecan pie with almonds on top?  How about cookies with almonds?  Brownies?  You don't know what you are missing!<br /><br />The convenient cannister lets you use and store these easily (another plus) since if you are using them for toppings you won't be going through the whole jar at once.  I found that even 3 weeks later they still retained their freshness and taste.<br /><br />So this summer indulge a little.. and let the creative person hiding inside you spice up those summer treats!"

I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it."

The cook time is slower, of course, than instant or 5-minute rice, but you get a better-quality rice.  The Jars last a LONG time, so this 4-pack is almost unnecessary!<br /><br />The one complaint actually comes from my husband who feels the rice tastes too ""oat-y"".  I admit you can taste that its NOT white rice, but in dishes, I don't think you can tell the difference.  However, if you are making this to eat plain, yes, you will taste the difference between this and white rice.  If you like the taste of brown rice, however, you'll be just fine."

This German company was the first to introduce the Gummi Bear to the world, and they are still the best.

My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, chicken, comes from chicken being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.

They're dusted with a light coating of what tastes like cocoa powder, something totally unexpected if you're used to snacking on nuts without much thought.<br /><br />These will get your attention!<br /><br />I opened the container and served them at a party, curious to see what the guests would think. They definitely got attention, with folks asking, ""Where did you get these? They're good!""<br /><br />Other reviewers have gone into the health benefits, so I won't belabor the point. I do know that the bowl was empty before the night was over, and more than a few people wrote down the name to pick them up the next time they're at the supermarket (or trolling on Amazon.)<br /><br />An interesting, unusual take on an old favorite, I can't recommend them highly enough!"

My main concern with this product is that these do not have much, if any, ""cocoa"" or ""dark chocolate"" flavor like they advertise. It's just a very light dusting of powder on each almond, and the taste really doesn't stand out. The almonds themselves are fine, and I've never had any real issues with any of Emerald's line of canned nuts. So if you're looking for a relatively healthy snack item, these would satisfy your cravings. Just don't expect a burst of chocolate flavor."

It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no ""palm"" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more."

It can be a little bland if you don't put anything but the rosehips in the infuser.  Hibiscus goes great with it, though.  It's a great tea for children because it's mild and fruity, for adults add it to something else.<br />Also, you can eat the rosehips after they've been brewed, sounds weird but they are great, they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin C.  Watch out for the pith (that's the best word I can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds), though, if you decide to eat the hips.  Every once in a while you find one that hasn't been de-pithed properly, hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips."

The large one was great, my dog Rocco had fun figuring out how to get the food out and became quite a pro at it. It is a good time killer for the dogs as they don't have much to do anyway. Then I forget to take it one time after he was done and he chewed through the rope. Well I liked to so much I go to get another and it's the smaller size. This one had a rubber rope instead of cloth. It didn't move smoothly and Rocco couldn't get ANY treats out of it. That rubber rope just doesn't glide as well as the cloth it sticks. Get the large one, even a small dog should be able to handle it."

We bought these last week and tried them, and he went crazy over them! He even ate a large bowl plain, with nothing on them, then later with spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />You do need to be careful to cook them long enough that they are not a very gross version of ""al dente,"" and not to overcook them to the point where they start to dissolve and get slimy. Be sure to also rinse with cold water, as the directions on the box indicate. As other reviewers mentioned, cooking for 10 minutes seems to work well.<br /><br />We had tried one box from the grocery, and we are now planning to buy a case here at Amazon. If you are looking for alternative noodles for a gluten-free family, I definitely recommend giving these a try. My son felt like he was back to getting what everyone else gets, and that was very nice for him."

I love how busy it keeps her, but in the end, I have to take a treat or two out for her because she can't do it on her own.  Probably better for bigger dogs."

I never used to like bothering with loose tea but this is very manageable as it is rolled young tea leaves. It's actually fun to handle! You can make it as strong as you like it. For a green tea it is very robust, I'd call it the Irish breakfast of green tea. I'm totally spoiled for other green teas now and am very happy to be able to buy the multi packs. Thanks Amazon!"

Whether I make it plain or fancy it up, it always tastes delicious.<br /><br />This brand of rice is great at creating wonderful hybrids for all kinds of dishes, highly recommended.<br /><br />- Kasia S."

I've tried many types of hot sauces, and many are overly spicy with no flavor, or not enough - this is truly something you can use as an actual 'spice' - something you can cook with to actually ADD FLAVOR. Very enjoyable.<br /><br />*update* Jan 2012<br />This is still one of my favorite hot sauces on the market. I saw another review proclaiming ""what flavor?"", and to this I warn that though Cholula is full-bodied and flavorful, it can also be much more subtle than many of the other hot sauce brands. Beyond that, if you're accustomed to nothing other than the spiciest paint thinner there is, you have probably destroyed the tastebuds required to enjoy this wonderful hot sauce. By now Cholula has another flavor, ""Chili lime"", which tastes equally good (my wife likes this flavor better), and is also very much worth trying.<br />The only other two hot sauces I bother with are Tabasco - both their Green Jalepeno and their Chipotle Pepper sauces are superb. The other hot sauces I've tried I feel forgo taste in favor of sheer spicyness - not what I look for."

I was a little unsure that this would keep my little # 3 BT  busy, but it does. It also keeps #2 BT busy, but #1 BT just wants you to shake the treats out. The only problem I have is finding treats small enough to work in it. Sometimes I just put their dog food in it and they still love to play with it. I definitely would recommend this dog toy to anyone who very active dogs it does keep them busy."

My dog loves this toy and it is fun to watch him try to work his moves to get the treats out. The only problem with this toy is that it is loud and my room mate hates it and takes it away.

I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!"

When the dog pulls on the rope, it lifts the bottle up into an upright position, and when it's vertical the treats don't come out.<br /><br />My dog quickly figured out that the best way for the toy to ""work"" was if I set it up and let him pull the rope out while I held the bottle horizontal.

That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!"

Both are treat-dispensing toys that keep dogs occupied for longer than most other toys.  My basset hound likes both toys, but seems to really like the tug-a-jug.  I put his kibble in there and it keep him occupied for quite a while.  He really likes grabbing the rope, and unlike the picture the rope on mine is made of rubber instead of twine.  It will probably not last long.  Also, this toy is LOUD.  Much louder than the tricky treat ball.  But, he seems to prefer this over the ball, so it gets my recommendation."

One example: a little bit of sliced chicken on top of a Triscuit; then some Colby Jack cheese on top of the chicken.  Do 4-5 of these critters, stick them in the microwave on a microwaveable dish, and melt the cheese. Yummy.<br /><br />There are any number of variations on this.  Sometimes I'll add a little thinly sliced onion to the mix.<br /><br />Anyhow, Triscuits can be awfully versatile for snacking. And still reasonably healthy as these things go. . . ."

It's not as much Hot as it is SPICY and the balance of the garlic is a beautiful thing. It doesn't drown out the taste of your food as much as it adds to it or enhances it. It also doesn't have that obnoxious jalapeno taste that many hot sauces have. A must buy for the hot sauce or bbq sauce fan, or someone like me that just loves breakfast."

He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy."

I wish it was a little harder to get the food out.  My dog Bailey is a master at pulling the rope stopper in and out to get out the little bits.  I tried putting in bigger dog treats, but they are too big.  Smaller dog food slides out pretty easily if Bailey gives the jar a whack.  He can get all the food out in under 15 minutes.  I need a puzzle toy that is more difficult so he can be distracted for hours.  If the puzzle toy is too difficult, he usually just gives up.<br /><br />But it's an awesome toy because it makes your dog think a lot and keeps them distracted, because lord knows that if puppies aren't distracted, they are going to want to play with you!"

Very good durability - the rattling of treats in the jar and the difficulty of getting to them perplexed my golden mix.  She likes this toy, but still prefers her treat-dispensing ball as she has become a master at rolling it to extract the treats.  I give the product 4.5 stars (but I rounded up) for standing up to the first two days of her chewing and trying to get the treats out without solving the puzzle.  It loses a half star because she generally gets disinterested after a few minutes of not being able to get treats out.  She does like to carry it around though!  Great toy overall!"

I saw this silly-looking toy at Walgreen's and it said it is bullet-proof plastic so I got it. My husband was skeptical and asked, ""Yeah, but is it Walter-proof?"" It is!!! Of course, the rope was history before 2 minutes passed and nearly all the rubber is off the top, but the hard plastic is scratched but still intact. I break up his hard biscuits and feed them through the top (the bottom screws off but if you put them through the top, you know they can fall out during play) and Walter flings it to the ground and rolls it around the get the treats to fall out. He loves it and it's almost always in his mouth. This is, hands down, his favorite toy. But, he's a smart dog and learned from a different toy (rubber ball with a hole in it) how to work treats out of a toy. You may have to demonstrate how it works to your dog."

The bottom unscrews making it easy to put treats in.  Small kibble works best.

It seems to be durable and is holding up well so far, my only concern is replacing the rope after my dog wears it out (he destroys rope toys in about 2 weeks usually). Other than that, I would recommend this to other dog owners whose dogs like to chew and play tug-of-war. Just make sure you don't mind little pieces of treats all over your floor - it's surprising how much treat actually dispenses, and my dog tends to overlook some of the dispensed treats when he is feeling playful. I wouldn't recommend this for small dogs, just because it is a good sized toy, but for medium to large dogs, this is great!"

I was getting raw goat's milk for quite a while and when we moved it wasn't available. The fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has. Maybe some people don't mind the taste, maybe some acquire a taste for it, and maybe some even like it, but I think it is vile.

Personally I prefer the pistachio or chocolate varities to the plain, but all three taste wonderful. The plastic containers keep it nice and fresh. A word to the wise: this Middle Eastern treat is so outrageously good that it is hard to stop eating it. Cut yourself a quarter-inch thick slice and then put the container away immediately, otherwise you will yield to the temptation of cutting more and more slices. Also, try to control yourself and eat it once a day. Needless to say, halva goes great with strong Turkish coffee and the two together will give you quite a burst of energy. The only way you could do better than Koska is to get real homemade halva which not easily available. Enjoy!"

They both had asthma, allergies and chronic ear infections.  My vet told me that is just how the breed is and I spent thousands of dollars on vet treatments.  I felt so sad for my dogs, I began exploring health options on my own.  After much research, I found that nutrition can cause and cure many health ailments, including all those my dogs had.<br /><br />I researched a variety of brands, and began buying Wellness Lite - within a few weeks, my dogs were both healthier than ever.  It has now been 10 months and we've had no more health problems whatsoever - my only regret is that I did not find this brand sooner!"

Have you ever had what you thought was the greatest thing ever and then get a ginormous amount of it? It's *that* intimdating. No single man should ever think about condiments in terms of pounds, let alone double digit pounds. But this is an amazing value, and you can never have too much of a good thing.

So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.

To be honest, its so good I prefer it to regular wheat pizza crust.  This is one of the very few products out there that not only nicely replaces the wheat version, but actually supersedes it in taste, texture, and quality.  My children - neither of whom are celiac - request Chebe over regular pizza."
08	36009,B001ACMCNA,AYGJ96W5KQMUJ,11/22/08,15,16,3,New formula - not so great,"Once upon a time, Chebe made the best pizza crust ever - great texture, thin and chewy, very tasty, even rolled out easily without sticking to pan or rolling pin.  Friends not on the gluten-free diet raved about it too.<br /><br />Not any more.  The formula used for the mix seems to have changed along with the instructions - making it easier to put together (no more baking the crust first, as we used to do, before adding toppings), but resulting in an inferior product.  It's lost the chewy texture and the great taste and is now just another over-priced GF mix - one package makes one medium-sized pizza.<br /><br />If you make it, oil your pizza pan (something that never used to be necessary) before putting the dough in it, or the pizza will stick.  And don't pile the toppings too high or add too much sauce, or the dough won't bake through in the middle.  If you're lucky, you'll get a fairly edible pizza - but you could make a good bigger pizza for less just using the pizza dough recipe in a good GF cookbook - e.g., Elizabeth Barbone's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891105418"">Easy Gluten-Free Baking</a>.  After all, you have to add oil, milk, cheese, and eggs to this Chebe mix - why not just mix up some dough from scratch and save yourself a lot of money?"

The almonds are nice and fresh and the subtle chocolate taste just adds to the enjoyment. They are NOT chocolate covered in the traditional sense - if you want candy, these won't do.

This drink is very fizzy and tastes tangy and vaguely citrusy like Sprite or the old Fresca, but I definitely didn't taste pomegranate.  The ingredients list a blend of six fruit juices, and it's pretty much a muddle, in my opinion.<br /><br />There is no added sugar and each 8 ounce can has 80 calories.  This drink might be a good substitute for an alcoholic drink served in a pretty glass, or as a base for punch, but I wouldn't choose it as a thirst-quencher or when I want a true juice flavor."

The white rice pasta I bought at the store was mushy and didn't hold its shape.  It was a pale imitation of the ""real thing"" (i.e. wheat pasta)  But Tinkyada's pasta I can enjoy eating.  As long as you cook according to the directions, you can't tell it's not ""normal"" pasta. I usually add a bit of oil to the water with the pasta to discourage sticking, because I don't do a very good job remembering to stir it!  It's also brown rice-based, so it's healthier for you.  One warning, if you put plain pasta in the fridge, it will be hardened when you pull it out.  But, heat it with some sauce, or reheat it in a pan of water on the stove, and it's nice and soft again.  If you store it with sauce, then this problem is avoided.<br /><br />I've tried four shapes of Tinkyada pasta, and this is definitely my favorite.  The fusilli is like a hollow spaghetti, with a slight twist to it.  With the interesting shape of spiral/rotini pasta, but without the bulkiness.  It seems very fancy, but doesn't really cost a whole lot more.  This is the shape we use most often.  We use it with marinara sauce, meat sauce, chicken parmesan, chicken noodle soup, etc.  Very versatile.  Highly recommended to anyone who can't eat wheat/gluten."

It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck.  I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat.

I've struggled with my LDL for years and I don't want to take medicine.  I did nothing at all to change my diet and exercise routine except to add a handful of these walnuts every day - and my cholesterol was better than ever.  My LDL went down.

My order was refused because according to Amazon ""they can't ship food"" overseas.  From doing some research I found that the reson they can't ship to an APO address is the vender uses either FedEx or UPS and they can't ship to an APO address.

Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh."

They bright juice color and brighter, young-looking packaging caused me to theorize that these drinks were just the same-old stuff with a clever marketing angle.<br /><br />Then I tried one.<br /><br />The quality of the product is certainly outstanding.  Pomegranate is a trendy flavor these days, yet many of the pomegranate-flavored products on the market don't adequately reflect the fruit's unique flavor.  Izze, as it says on the can, ""stays true to the fruit"" and it is evident in the fact that their pomegranate drink actually tastes like pomegranate.  The flavor is full, yet not overpowering, and the flavor tends to stay in your mouth for some time.  Although the product is made with carbonated water, there is certainly no ""coca-cola"" quality to it.  There is not excessive carbonation, but rather the light carbonation of the water tends to enhance the flavor of the juice itself--yet another way in which Izze stays true to the fruit.<br /><br />It appears as if the middle-schoolers have a more refined taste than I gave them credit for.  Izze Pomegranate drink is excellent.  I highly recommend this product and will be sure to keep it around the house, myself."

Unfortunately I've offered this product twice and it was tried for a mouthful and later ignored.  Interestingly, I also have a young cat (formal feral) and even this former dumpster-diver sniffed and walked.  I will continue to offer this and hope it catches on eventually.<br /><br />There are other products for the condition but this one seemed to be the most palatable from reviews.  There also seems to be some controversy over whether a cat in early stages of kidney failure should be fed a low protein or low phosphorus diet.  Further, there seems to be an issue in later stages with cats losing weight and not wanting to eat, and I am not sure if a food like this would encourage eating.  One day at a time.<br /><br />So here I am with the smallest amount one could buy (24 cans).  If this food doesn't get a decent reception soon, I will probably donate it to my vet's office for other sick cats to try.  If you've got an ill kitty, and you've been told to try a low protein/phosphorus food, it can't hurt to do lots of reading and try this, but no miracles in my household just yet!<br /><br />Update March 2010 - It's been 1 and 1/2 years since I wrote the above review.  Your vet advice and results may vary, but my cat has done very well on a normal diet since then.  After doing much reading and talking with our vet, special foods are not yet called for for my cat.  Have your cat's blood levels checked to see if they are doing ok with phosphorous and you and your vet can decide from there if food like this is advisable.  It may be better to discuss if your cat can stay on regular food and use a phosphorous blocker.<br /><br />More and more I am reading that weight loss is a problem for cats in kidney failure so keeping the food desirable to them could be a big deal.  My cat is having more issues with the accompanying hyperthyroidism than with the kidney disease currently, and while he has indeed lost some weight, his blood tests are showing he's doing pretty well."

Suddenly she lost interest in the canned and I was forced to add sardines to it. Sort of defeats the purpose of limiting the protein doesn't it? Well, I  was heartsick because already thin to begin with, she wasn't eating enough to gain weight. She would just sit and stare at her bowl. In desperation, I knew I had to find a better food, so I read the reviews here and ordered a case and voila! She eats it without sauce or sardines. She can't get enough of it. I had to order another case. So now she's eating one can a day which is good. Though I wish they would make this in a dry too, so she could nibble through the night. She won't even touch the dry anymore! And we all know what a wet diet can do to the teeth. I highly recommend a dental treat such as enzadent oral chews and a daily cleaning or adding a dental additive to the water. But I shouldn't complain, she's eating and that's what I wanted. Anyway, I don't know what they put in this food, but my cat sure likes it and thanks to it, she's going to be around for a long time still!"

The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby."

My vet recommended Hi-Tor Neo a couple years ago and he took right too it.  Granted, he's not all that picky but he gets very vocal when he's ready for his Neo (the Siamese yowl).  Obviously he loves it and he's very healthy and active.  Sometimes I add some water to it to make a ""gravy"" when he's a bit dehydrated and he thinks that's an extra special treat.  Highly recommend this product verses the prescribed brand that's more expensive and not so tasty to the felines."

In fact, it has a very refreshing fruity taste, which is enhanced by the light carbonation.<br /><br />It's made from concentrates of juices, including apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. The rest of the mix is comprised of sparkling water, fruit & vegetable coloring, and added vitamins like C & B6 (very small amounts).<br />Even though it contains lemon and cranberrry juice concentrates, it isn't too tart.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice alternative to soda. And here's a little extra something I experimented with: mixed with a little wine (I used Sangria) it made a great wine cooler! ;)<br /><br />It's also low sodium and has just 80 calories per 8.4 fl. oz.

This is more in the tradition of the European ""lemonades""--fizzy water and fruit juice with little or no sugar.<br /><br />The can is the size of one of those energy drinks. (8oz.) If you like a fizzy drink now and then, I can't think of anything better. I don't drink soda, diet or regular (no point to either.) Izze, however, is quite nice. Try it."

There is no caffeine, no processed sugar, and no unnatural ingredients.  It is refreshing to read the ingredients and find that I recognize every ingredient!  And they are all safe!<br /><br />The pomegranate juice is mixed in with a bit of grape and apple juice, to mitigate a mild (but not unpleasant) bitter citrus aftertaste, somewhat like grapefruit juice.  The sparkle has a feel closer to sparkling water than to carbonated soda -- and I like that.  It is a distinctive flavor -- and I like that too.  I wasn't sure what to think after just one can, but after trying it a couple of times I have found that it is quite nice.<br /><br />I liked the ruby red grapefruit flavor all at once -- it has the perfect grapefruit flavor, the sweet tangy delicious zing, without the bitter aftertaste of grapefruit.  It is not too sweet, but just right for that grapefruit flavor fix that I like now and again.  This is the perfect size container, especially for my kids who also love the grapefruit flavor.  Good stuff.<br /><br />What I also like is that Izze appears to be a company with a conscience.  Started by a couple of friends in 2003 who liked the idea of an all natural and distinctive beverage as an alternative to soda, Izze uses their product as a platform from which to promote awareness of the Global Education Fund (and other good causes, both environmental and global) that they support."

Sadly I couldn't find the Twinings' blackcurrant tea and had to settle for another brand at the market there, and hadn't forgotten about this since. To my elated surprise, I recently discovered that Amazon was selling them and immediately bought a TON to stock up. Should have checked a long time ago..<br /><br />This is by far my favorite tea.

I actually did a double take to look at the can and search for alcohol content. By the end of the can I liked it, and by the 3rd can I really liked it. It's tangy, fresh, with no sweet aftertaste and has a cool looking container design (aesthetics always matter!).<br /><br />With a total of 80 calories per cute little can, this isn't exactly what you'd call a ""diet drink,"" but I find it to be surprisingly filling, so it makes a great in-between liquid snack, and can stave away the hunger pangs until your next meal without doing damage to your diet.<br /><br />Overall a nifty drink in a most attractive can. Don't let the first taste fool you. Izze's Pomegranate Fizzy is quite yummy...a very pleasurable acquired taste.<br />.......................................<br />Grapefruit: Izze's Sparkling grapefruit is absolutely the best drink in a can I have ever tasted. Nothing is even a close 2nd. Tangy and refreshing, its lemony grapefruit flavor is quite strong and tantalizing. It also contains white grape, apple and orange juice from concentrates, but what my taste buds remember most is the lemon and grapefruit. The Grapefruit flavor has 90 calories per can, for those counting calories, but like the Pomegranate, it's very filling, and does well as an ""in-between"" snack for dieters.<br /><br />This wonderful Izze fizzy is addictive. On a hot day cold Sparkling Grapefruit is a total delight, and since it does not have refined sugars it truly takes away your thirst, not like those soda pop drinks that actually seem to make one thirstier. Thank you Izze, your Sparkling Grapefruit gets the gold award for canned beverage in my house.<br />If you're into ""hard likker,"" Izze's Grapefruit would make the perfect mixer, for vodka or tequila."
08	89403,B0014WYXQK,A96K1ZGW56S2I,7/11/08,13,17,2,It's NOT Pomegranate Juice and Tastes Bitter,"I've enjoyed Izze drinks in the past and for the past year and a half have been drinking pomegranate juice whenever I get the chance.  When I learned about Izze's FORTIFIED ALL NATURAL SPARKLING POMEGRANATE JUICE, I was rather excited at the prospect of tasting some. I was rather disappointed.  To begin with, even though this product is labeled as pomegranate juice, it's a misnomer because this is not real pomegranate juice.  Instead it's a hybrid containing juices from concentrates of apples, white grapes, pineapples, lemons, cranberries, pomegranates, and a few other added vitamins.  The other vitamins don't bother me so much, but when a product is labeled and marketed as pomegranate juice, that's what a person should expect to get, not a mixture of a bunch of juices only one of which is pomegranate.  Besides the false labeling, the drink is quite bitter and hard to drink.  Drinking the beverage straight from the cans doesn't quite cut it (it tastes a bit metallic) and I've had to pour the stuff in a glass with ice.  Perhaps the absorption of the ice takes away part of the bitterness, but I've found the drink tastes much better this way.  But, overall, you'd best just avoid buying the stuff altogether."

Perfect for the holiday time, after dinner and dessert","This Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark chocolate has 3 component to it which makes it taste very interesting as you take a bite at it. Chocolate layer (available in milk or dark or 60% dark), white chocolate layer, and peppermint crust. It's kind of unorthodox to use peppermint (or replace mint) with chocolate (as you might be tired of the peppermint candy cane), but they didn't put too much peppermint crust so it is good. but enough to give the kick of the mint taste (and mintier than the regular mint chocolate)<br /><br />If you like mint or peppermint, there is a good chance that you will like this peppermint bark chocolate (maybe not at the first bite). This is perfect for the holiday time, after dinner and dessert.<br /><br />I like the Dark Chocolate version compare to the Milk chocolate version because the white chocolate layer is already milky and sweet, as well as the peppermint crust, so the dark chocolate will give more balance and reduce the overall sweetness of this chocolate<br /><br />If you like this chocolate, you might want to try the after eight mint chocolate which is also very good.

This product is not all that smooth and mediocre when compared to the type she had.  This product did maintain that characteristic good Monkey Picked Oolong Teas of never becoming more bold in taste as the tea steeps longer all the way through your drinking experience. Preparing the tea in your YiXing teapot chinese style will improve your experience and  is better than typically American style brewing. It seems priced close to some of the offerings on the net.  I will not fault the service of the company.  This product is slightly less refined than some picks."

08	89404,B0014WYXQK,AFLPMS5K3DZL5,5/2/08,3,3,3,Okay,"I've tried both the pomegranate and the blackberry. Of the two, I prefer the pomegranate.<br /><br />I don't mind that is only 70% juice, that seems fine and they seem sweet enough. But, unlike the 100% sparkling grape juice I have had in the past, these two Izze flavors leave my mouth feeling somewhat dry...in a way I have not experienced with other drinks. These 8.4 fl.oz. cans contain Izze Fortified which means fortified with 10% of the USRDA of Vitamin C, Vitamin 6 and Niacin. It appears from the Izze web site that Izze in 12 oz bottles is not fortified so I might one day want to try the non-fortified Izze and see what that is like.<br /><br />However, the 100% sparkling grape juice I can buy locally, although it comes in a much larger bottle so may not be as convenient, seems more economical so, if I wanted a sparking juice, I'd probably buy that instead. Or I might sometimes, but not often, want a sparkling water. But usually I am more than content with tap water. If I want fruit, I can alway eat fruit."

If you haven't previously eaten European cookies, you may no like these.  I have to also admit that after I made the purchase, I started to look at some of the previous reviews and I was appalled at how much calories and fat these cookies have.  Granted, they're cookies for Heaven sakes (not health food), but don't be fooled into thinking that since you may find them a bit bland that they probably have less of the ""bad stuff"" in them.......Not so!<br /><br />Long and the short, if you've never tried these cookies before, I would strongly recommend that you sample a sleeve (if you can find them) in your grocery store so you don't get stuck with a case that may not be eaten if your family doesn't like them."

08	89405,B0014WYXQK,A3J031UXHGZTWV,4/28/08,3,3,5,"Clean, crisp and an alternative to high fructose energy drinks","First impressions of IZZE Pomegranate (that's a funny word if you say it too many times):<br /><br />Attractive packaging and accurate descriptions on the labels with one exception. On the logo side of the can it says ""Pure Fruit Juice"", and I know this is childish, but then it says ""& sparkling water fortified with vitamins."" Well, that's hardly pure fruit juice. It has other stuff in it too. However, IZZE Beverages redeem themselves by actually not adding refined sugars or caffeine to the drink. This is something I can give to my children and not worry about Child Protective Services hunting me down. I was surprised to see that pomegranate (funny word!) is not the main ingredient. It's sixth on the list. Apple, white grape, clarified pineapple, lemon, cranberry and then pomegranate (teehee). I guess ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" sounded better to the marketing department than ""Bubbly Clarified Pineapple Juice"" (not funny sounding at all, which is also a definite negative in my personal selection of a thirst-quenching beverage).<br /><br />Taste. This is the good part. It's clean with a little sweet-tartness. Very nice balance and engages quite a few taste buds. It's fizzy and crisp. It kind of reminds me of the grape juice that I used to sneakily drink during church as a child, but with vitamin C, Niacin and B6. It has a nice, easy after taste that is not offensive like a few other drinks in this category.<br /><br />The profits. The company claims to be in partnership with the Global Education Fund ""to help provide educational opportunities and resources to needy children around the world."" And there's a kicker.<br /><br />The kicker: A lot of companies tout their philanthropic ventures. But with IZZE it appears that they actually do benefit humankind through a compassionate capitalism. The put their money to work! Employees, if the report is true, actually donate personal time for fund raisers and collect books in an IZZE vehicle. Those books are sent internationally to orphans and other needy children for their educational benefit. If you are involved with a school, you can partner with the Global Education Fund and do the same thing as IZZE. They are also involved in improving the ""quality of life for children with chronic and life-threatening medical conditions"" and programs promoting environmental responsibility and there's even more. Wow.<br /><br />And my two-year old loves it. She found a new treat. And now I have a new reward for positive behavior! bwahahahaha [pirate laugh]<br /><br />Great drink. Great company. I'm sold."
08	44619,B001EQ55RW,A2SX1068IPJW5E,6/8/08,0,0,5,Fantastic and healthy snack!,"Almonds are a very healthy snack, but I have to admit that most almonds taste a little like cardboard to me. These, however, were a notable exception. The dusting of cocoa was a perfect complement to the taste of the almonds without being overwhelming or cloyingly sweet. In addition, the chocolate was about as healthy as chocolate can be with very little added fat or sugar.<br /><br />Yes, the chocolate taste is subtle, and if you are having a serious craving for chocolate you would be far better off with a chocolate bar. But, these nuts are healthier and better for you! I, personally, liked the combination. But, I suspect this is a matter of your personal likes and dislikes. I tend to like my almonds roasted, and my chocolate dark and with very little sugar, so for me the resulting flavor pairing was perfect. I have tried almonds with a heavier milk chocolate coating and I have never liked them, nor wanted to eat more than one or two. My family finished an entire 11 ounce canister in one sitting and I (I am embarrased to admit) could have finished the entire thing myself.<br /><br />Some of the almonds DID taste a little on the burnt side, but this is pretty typical of roasted almonds in general. The price, however, is rather high. By my estimate, these would run abour $7-8 a pound, which is rather steep for roasted almonds even when you add the cost of the chocolate. The price alone is what would keep me from buying them on a regular basis."

On the other hand, I didn't like overly diluted juices with added sugar - natural or artificial - either. IZZE seemed to be the juice product that I was looking for. It contains no refined sugars or artificial sweeteners. It's 70% juice, so it tasted sufficiently fruity to me. Because it's not 100% juice (with sparkling water added, which gives it a mild ""kick""), to my palate it had just enough sweetness (from the juices themselves) and acidity. In addition, pomegranate juice seems to be renowned for its cancer-fighting properties. I considered this a healthful and tasteful juice product."

Anyone who loves ginger will love it. The Tulsi adds a wonderful depth to the flavour that seems to mix very well with the ginger (I have also ordered the Organic India Tulsi Jasmine tea and was very disappointed; the Tulsi tasted kind of odd... I got used to it, but it was far from 'delicious'.) If you like sweet things, add honey. One word of caution: it takes a little trial and error to get the brewing length right for this tea; if you steep it too long it can (like any ginger tea, in fact) develop an unpleasant bitter taste."

It comes in a small can (8.4 oz) that I enjoy in a wine glass (it's about the amount of liquid in a very large glass of wine).<br /><br />Some pomegranate juices are sour, but this one is tasty and sweeter than most...actually it tastes like real pomegranate pieces (arils) do---perfect! It is a sparkling juice, and sweetened just with real fruit. Technically, pomegranates are considered a ""superfood"", so this is a healthy way of improving your diet via beverage choice. It's also fortified with vitamins C and B6 and niacin as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

So, keep in mind I haven't tasted lots of coffees. I find most coffees bitter and gross, like starbucks or whatever my mom buys. With some splenda I actually enjoy this, so even if you don't like coffee give this a try. It's definitely one of the better one."

08	89408,B0014WYXQK,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,4/23/08,9,12,3,Pomegranate Izze Cans Don't Measure Up to Izze in Bottles.,"Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is one of my favorite fruit sodas, and I'm rarely without a few bottles in the house. When I ordered the Sparking Pomegranate in cans, I expected it to be a very similar product. Izze sparking juices in cans are called ""Izze Fortified"", because, unlike the bottled drinks, they are fortified with vitamins C (6 mg), B6 (0.2 mg), and Niacin (2 mg). That's 10% of the USRDA for those vitamins, an insignificant amount. But I wondered if the addition of vitamins would change the taste or if the aluminum can would impart a minerally flavor.<br /><br />I'm not sure what changed the taste, to tell the truth. Apart from the vitamins, the ingredients are the same as in bottled Izze. The vitamin C is in the form of ascorbic acid, but too scant to affect flavor. I'm not fond of very sweet things, so I love the sweet-tart taste of pomegranate. Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is the best pomegranate soda that I've tasted, because it tastes more like fresh pomegranate than pomegranate juice. The Izze Fortified Sparkling Pomegranate goes beyond tart into bitter, however, and it's not nearly as carbonated as the Izze in bottles. This is more of a slightly sparkling juice than a fruit soda.<br /><br />It may be that the sweeter flavors of Izze fare better in cans. I suspect that the reduced carbonation is concentrating the pomegranate flavor to poor effect. This stuff tastes flat to me as well as bitter. Sparkling Grapefruit is another tart favorite, so I don't think I'll try that in cans either. These are small 8.4 oz cans that are easy for someone with small hands to grasp but hold significantly less beverage than a traditional 12 oz drink can. They would be great for the pool or beach, where glass bottles are prohibited, if only the contents tasted better. If you're an Izze fan, stick with the bottles. The Izze Fortified just isn't refreshing in pomegranate."
08	44620,B001EQ55RW,A199FRO0YFMGED,6/8/08,0,0,3,"Taste good, pretty healthy, but something is off",I think Emerald is a better brand than Planter and Diamond. They keep the nuts very fresh and have many different flavors. I buy Emrald's dry roasted almonds regularly. And no one seems to tire of it. I also buy the flavored ones when we have guests and always receive accolades.<br /><br />But the cocoa roast almonds are still left in the jar after 3 weeks. Initially everyone said it tasted good and it is very healthy with almost no sugar. But then no one wants to eat much of it afterwards. They went for the dry roast or the barbecue ones.

A pleasant surprise was that although it is dusted with cocoa powder, they are really not sweet.. Although I personally found the after-taste not very appealing,,  I served them to ten other people. One didn't like them at all, but the others gave them either 4 or 5 stars--particularly enjoying the smallness, crispness and lack of sweetness.  I probably wouldn't get them again for myself, but defnitely could put a bowl out for guests, as a casual alternative to greasier and sweeter snack foods."

08	89410,B0014WYXQK,A30QAOLNZ4415R,6/12/08,2,2,5,Absolutely delicious and refreshing.,"Izze is one of my favorite drinks. When I cut sodas out of my diet, I looked for something to replace them. Ultimately, I ended up drinking a lot of sparkling water. But when I need something a little sweeter, I found these and I adore them. It's real fruit juice and sparking water so it still has sugars in it - just not added/refined sugar. So it's a lot better for you and a lot fewer calories than downing a coke.<br /><br />I do have a couple of very minor complaints (but they're so minor, the product still gets 5 stars from me). I feel like the drink could actually have a little less juice and a little more sparkling water. Sometimes it's just a little too sweet for me. Also, these cans are a little small (smaller than a normal can of soda). However, I've found a really easy way around both of these. I pour the can into a glass and top it off with some plain sparking water. Perfect!<br /><br />All the flavors are good, but pomegranate is my favorite (however, I'm a huge fan of just about anything pomegranate)."

It's not super-sugary like a normal fruit-flavored pop and it has a lighter fizz (just the right amount, if you ask me). I tried the Pomegranate flavor, which I would describe more as a tart cherry/pomegranate blend. It has quickly become my beverage of choice when I open up the fridge. It's definitely more of a sparkling fruit juice than what you would think of as ""pop"". I highly recommend it!"
08	89412,B0014WYXQK,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,4/23/08,2,2,3,Izze Leaves Lily A Little Underwhelmed,"I live and work in Boulder, Colorado where Izze is headquartered and the product is available almost everywhere here and even sold in the school where I teach. So I've had the chance to try most of the flavors over the last few years. While I appreciate that Izze ""stays true to the fruit"" as their slogan says and is ""refined"" sugar(though it still has 19 grams of sugar per serving) caffeine and preservative free I just don't really care for the taste and would prefer to drink regular fruit juice or water if I'm being virtuous or diet soda if I'm walking on the wild side.  I do especially like pomegranate juice so in trying this flavor I thought maybe I'd finally found the right Izze for me.  Yet the bottom line is I still prefer my juice without ""sparkling"" water.  I should note that the 70% fruit juice content of Izze Pomegranate also includes apple, white grape, cranberry, lemon and pineapple juices and though pomegranate may be the smallest per cent of the juices it definitely is the dominant flavor."

08	89413,B0014WYXQK,A2X7NBUETXC19E,4/22/08,2,2,4,The Good Stuff,"It's often the simplest ideas that work the best. These Izze beverages aren't complicated at all - they're 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water - but they sure taste great. I enjoy pomegranate juice, but I never go through enough to make buying the jugs they sell at the supermarket worthwhile. That's where these Izze single-serving cans come in handy.<br /><br />The good: The 8 ounce can is a reasonable serving size, it only has 80 calories, there isn't any caffeine or added sugar, and it tastes great.<br /><br />The bad: I was expecting a bit more carbonation. Still, that's a minor complaint.<br /><br />The best: This juice makes a great mixer for your favorite adult beverage. I prefer it with vodka, but I imagine it would work fairly well with gin too.<br /><br />The verdict: Order a case! So far I've only tried the pomegranate juice, but I'll definitely be ordering more in the future."

They  are not very sweet but the cookie wafers are crispy and delicately buttery flavored.  Personally, I do not think they taste anything at all like a Ritz cracker with no salt.  And I liked the cocoa cream center very much -- again not real sweet but really chocolately tasting.  The cookies are a nice size, too. I was leery of buying 24 packs here on Amazon based on a couple of the reviews but I did find it locally so I bought a test package.  The price was about 50% more than the Amazon price though. I liked them very much and NOW I will definitely order the case from Amazon so I can keep them on hand."

The wafers aren't overly sweet and have a filling like Nutella.  What I don't understand is the price.  These are available in my local grocery store for $1.19 per package.  Same size, same brand.  And please don't think that I must live in some metropolis of cool where all foodstuffs are available at all times.  I live in West Virginia.  And I don't even have to go to a specialty store for these.  They're in the regular supermarket in one of the most backwards states in the nation.  If I thought Amazon wouldn't kick me out, I'd offer to start my own Hits shipping business.  But of course Amazon would kick me out, so I won't.  I'm an avid Amazon shopper, but this is just silly."

While it's nice that Bahlsen doesn't use trans fat, the hydrogenated filling has the cheap and greasy consistency of Crisco, and is loaded with saturated fat. Palm oil would make these a little healthier, butter would make them taste much better, but alas manufacturers must always use the cheapest ingredients possible. Since Bahlsen's price is much more reasonable than other manufacturers, and since they are superior to most brands (except the crumbs!), they are worth considering.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim these have a hazelnut filling have sensitive palates. While these cookies may or may not contain traces of hazelnuts, their filling tastes mundanely of cocoa."

I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.<br /><br />It can be a bit greasy, but word has it that if you let greasy 'jerky' products sit out overnight in the open air that it helps with that. I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good.

But not Emerald's Marcona Almonds.<br /><br />Emerald's cocoa nuts are just a tad harder, but still not as hard as almonds you get in bins or even packaged. The chocolate dusting is just the right amount to give you the cocoa flavor without losing the nut taste, as is the case with some coated versions.<br /><br />I'll probably not make peanut butter out of this flavor but as a healthy snack for the heart - eight to ten nuts a couple times a day - they are perfect."

The drinks are good but from the can it looks as if it would some sort of ""health drink"".  I got the impression that this would be a low-to-no calorie beverage but each little can packs a pretty decent 80 calories.  So, if you are counting calories, Izze's might not be for you.

It's amazing what a difference it makes in the food we cook, compared to other sea salts we use, and all our guests take notice when I use it! We still use Redmond Sea Salt for day-to-day cooking, and it's very good too, but whenever we want to add something special, we add the black or the red.

There calorie content is almost identical to regular soda but because they have a natural tartness, they don't taste as sweet.  So this is not a way to reduce your caloric intake except that the cans are smaller than regular soda cans.  With 70% fruit juice you might expect that Izze sodas would have more Vitamin C but the fruit juices used in Izze are mostly grape and apple.

I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them."

They're rather good.  Unlike other Chocolate nuts, these have a thin layer of chocolate that gives them a nice balance between the almonds and the chocolate.  Even my wife who doesn't like chocolate likes these quite a bit."

I like spicy things and just ordered another shipment of these because I went through them faster than I had anticipated.  They are moist and chewy, but not so chewy that you're still chewing to make it swallowable after all the flavor's gone.  I think they struck a nice balance.<br /><br />A caveat: If you're used to Tofurky Jurky or Primal Spirit, these will strike you as a little bit airy.  Also, these are a bit higher in fat than the other brands: 8 or 9 grams per 160-calorie package.  These ones don't really feel too oily in your mouth, though."

However, the product is processed on equipment that is also used to process wheat, soy, other types of nuts, and milk.<br /><br />A lot of thought went into product and packaging design.  This is a clean snack to eat, as the cocoa powder stays on the nut and doesn't get all over your hands.  The cannister is designed to fit in a car's drink holder (though at over 1500 calories per can, it's probably a REALLY bad idea to drive around with this so easily at hand), and the lid holds one serving's worth of nuts.  One serving is a satisfying little treat, but the tempation to keep filling the lid back up is nearly irresistible."

Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.<br /><br />Far too many ""vitamin drinks"" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have."

On top of that, the package contains more cartons than than the organic product for less money.  Of course it's from cows not treated with rbST.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Reduced fat milk, sugar, contains 1% or less of each of the following: cocoa (processed with alkali), cocoa, carrageenan, salt, artificial flavor, vitamin A palmitate and vitamin D3.<br /><br />Chocolate milk is the only dairy product that I think tastes good with carrageenan in it.  Most chocolate milks have it.  It's made from seaweed, has been a food product for centuries, and adds a nice creaminess to the drink.<br /><br />In short, great product, great price, and great for the kids (especially when traveling.)"

The chocolate gives the nuts a little something unexpected and extra.  I found myself eating a handful the first time.  I am not a huge fan of almonds but these are absolutely delicious.  They are not really sweet but the dark chocolate give a hint of sweetness and richness that i think plain almonds lack.<br />They are addictive.  It's a good thing almonds are good for you !!  I would highly recommend these as a snack.  I also really like the twist lid.  It makes it so convienent to grab a handful.  yes, these almonds are the perfect snack !"

Perhaps having enjoyed so many authentic and freshly prepared meals (we cook a lot of Indian dishes and use fresh spices) both at home and in restaurants, I had higher expectations than other reviewers. Would definitely NOT recommend.<br /><br />The paste was hard to mix (so that the chicken was coated evenly) and the ""Sauce"" consistency was runny. (And I used even less water than suggested.)<br /><br />You'd be better off with one of the many sauces in a jar (if you can stand all the salt), if you can't make fresh.<br /><br />It's too easy to just create your own sauce from scratch. Better flavor, which is the bottom line."
08	89423,B0014WYXQK,A6VPK7X53QNAQ,4/23/08,1,1,4,"Izze flavors are actually a mix of different juices, pom tasted like cranberry but grapefruit was better.","Izze is a great concept, especially as this is one soda that is actually a little healthier than the usual carbonated beverages. I ordered the Pomegranate and Grapefruit and preferred the latter much more.<br /><br />Pomegranate: I love Pomegranate juices like Pom and other organic alternatives available [...] as it is a very heart healthy drink. However, despite my liking for the tart taste, the Izze pomegranate juice in cans has a slightly bitter after taste and does not taste as good as real pomegranate juice. It may be due to the dilution or just because this pomegranate juice is ""adulterated"" with more cranberry juice than pomegranate! It does state on the can that it is a mixture of several juices like grape, pineapple, cranberry. However, since the can said pomegranate I was expecting the juice to be primarily pomegranate and I feel slightly cheated if I taste more cranberry. It would be nice to see more information on the can about the proportion of pomegranate juice in this juice mix.<br /><br />Since I found this juice to be a little too bitter, I tried making a ""Pom-cosmo-tini"", essentially a Cosmopolitan using Izze Pom and it turned out quite delicious. Now I know where the rest of the case is going, time to throw a party!<br /><br />Grapefruit: This one tasted a whole lot better and has none of the bitter after taste of the Pomegranate. It tastes more like real grapefruit although this is also a mix of several juices.<br /><br />In a taste test, I asked my friends to try the Pom and the Grapefruit. Everyone was excited to see the stylishly slim can but no one liked the Pom flavor. In fact one person said it tasted like cough syrup and poured it down the sink. My daughter also rejected the Pomegranate after one sip and finished half the grapefruit can. I was hoping she'd like Izze a bit more so I could give her some to drink at school, I believe the Apple and the Blackberry flavors are sweeter so I'll try those next."
08	89424,B0014WYXQK,A3MLKJ1HHA2SX0,4/23/08,1,1,5,Delicious and Refreshing,"Wow.  That was the first thing that came to mind when I opened one of these and tried it.  Not only was it delicious and thirst-quenching, but it was also good for me and didn't come loaded down with sugars.  I was very impressed at both the flavor and the content.<br /><br />So many beverages nowadays are just loaded with sugar and other artificial flavorings.  Then we wonder why we are getting so overweight in this country.  Izze has turned the tables on all that and uses only the natural sweetness of the fruits to sweeten up the drinks.  At 80 calories a pop, those 80 calories are actually something good for your body and not just junk calories!<br /><br />I noticed after I drink one that my thirst quickly goes away.  Again, this comes back to the fact they aren't loading the drink down with sugar.  It is a great after-workout drink because it really does help quench that deep-down thirst.<br /><br />At first I was concerned about the small size, but you soon find out that they are just perfect for one serving.  Instead of tempting you to overindulge like most soft drinks, this one actually gives you ONE serving and ONE serving only.<br /><br />A great product and one that is good for you -- how can you go wrong?"

This flavor makes a good mixer too.

I especially like the container as it fits nicely in the cup holder of my car and stroller. It makes a nice take-along snack during the day when running around and not having time for a meal always. The almonds have a hint of dark chocolate flavor. By the time you realize there's chocolate flavor, poof it's gone and you're onto the almond taste. For a person who enjoys almonds and the dark chocolate flavor is a bonus-this is still a nice snack. If you are purchasing this thinking it will be more dark chocolate and less almond, then you will likely be disappointed. I did not give 5-stars only because when I gave the almonds to my children who normally eat plain almonds and other nuts, they did not care for the dark chocolate roast. Hey what do kids know!"
08	89426,B0014WYXQK,AN81JUYW2SL24,4/22/08,1,1,4,"Tarty juice drink, great for the summer.","I refrigerated the cans as soon as they arrived as I prefer chilled juice beverages. Upon opening the can, I noticed a release of gas. The details on the can indicate there is sparkling water, aka carbonated water much like soda. Rather than being a pure pomegranate juice drink, there is a mix of other juices: apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry, and pomegranate. I could easily detect the cranberry and apple, followed by grape and lemon. The pineapple and pomegranate was extremely subtle. The drink is far from being sweet and tastes much like apple/cranberry juice. My only complaint is that the cans are rather small. If they were 12 ounce cans or of larger volume, I would have enjoyed it for a longer period of time. The Izze Pomegranate juice is advertised to not contain any refined sugars, caffeine, or preservatives. Overall, this is the perfect chilled beverage for relaxing outside during the summer."

But, I had also heard that walnuts are good for cholesterol issues.  I have always struggled with keeping my LDL (bad) cholesterol down while keeping my good (HDL) cholesterol up.  I eat a healthy diet, I exercise, and do everything I can, but after adding these walnuts to my diet (I eat a handful a day), the results have been incredible! For the first time in my life, my cholesterol is so great that my doctor doesn't try to get me to take medicine for it anymore. (I always refused to take it).  My LDL is way down and my HDL is so high it's off the charts (108)!  The best thing is that the nuts taste wonderful and are a great afternoon snack!!!"

We've got three teenagers at home and although they'd like to have it around, it doesn't fit in with our ongoing attempt to eat healthy. :-)<br /><br />Izze's sparkling pomegranate is a great alternative and all the kids loved it.  My husband and I did too. It's a mixture of 70% fruit juice with sparkling water and vitamins added. It has no refined sugar and most importantly no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />The can is an 8.4 oz. size, smaller then your normal soda but really a perfect size in my opinion. It got a thumbs up all around.<br /><br />The pomegranate flavor was tangy, not too sweet and delicious. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other Izze flavors too for a non-soda soft drink treat for the family. Highly recommended!"
08	89428,B0014WYXQK,A2HXE29CU1I24Y,4/24/08,2,3,3,Original owners had a great cause and purpose.,"INITIAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I like the idea of creating a drink that is true to the fruit's taste.  If you ate a fresh fruit, you would have an idea of what IZZE drinks would taste like.  This is a good thing, of course.  But in order to appreciate the drink, you will have to re-orient your taste if you've been drinking the over-sweetened fruit drinks.<br /><br />In a market saturated with energy drinks full of caffeine and artificial sweeteners, the company chose to go the other way to create a naturally sweet drink with no refined sugars, no caffeine and no preservatives.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT:<br /><br />For 2008 the company, which is now under PepsiCo, introduces the IZZE Fortified which contains 10% of the USRDA Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin.  And this is what is being reviewed.<br /><br />I don't know if this the fortification will make a dent towards a healthier drink compared with other fortified drinks in the market.  I guess if you couple this with the fact that it contains 70% fruit juice and is low in sodium then people who are looking for something else other than water will perhaps have a reason to want to drink this than go the soda route.<br /><br />The remaining 30% is seltzer water which can be a good alternative and a great way for adults and children to slowly steer away from the usual carbonated drinks.  Although with Pepsi at the marketing wheel, it is interesting to see how they position this product with the rest of their soda line up.  (They did say they will leave the product alone, but this is a relatively young acquisition so let's not think for a moment that the product has settled in already when it's actually just beginning.)<br /><br />TASTE:<br /><br />They have geared the drink toward a more natural taste.  So if you are used to sweetened juices, be wary and try a single sample of each flavors than a whole bulk at once.  Because the pomegranate taste you may come to know may not actually be the same taste you expect with this product.  This company is not shy in making you taste the tartness or sourness when present in a fruit.<br /><br />To compare my taste buds with others, I made my colleagues try the ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" and I got adverse reactions on the flavor.  The thing is these are people who are soda drinkers.  So they may not be the correct target market for this kinds of healthy-tasting drinks.  But then again the manufacturers need to lure these people as well if they want to expand their market.<br /><br />That's why it's interesting to see how PepsiCo will market this product in full force and convince the general soda drinkers to appreciate the taste.<br /><br />Although for a product that tries to stick to the natural fruit taste, it would be perplexing to me when the first ingredient found in a drink called ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" would be ""pure juice made from Apple""...which goes on to list in this order ""White Grape. Clarified Pineapple, Lemon, Cranberry and Pomegranate.""  Finally, Pomegranate is mentioned albeit at the end!<br /><br />SIZE:<br /><br />8.4 FL OZ is too little these days.  Although consuming this liquid in sparkling form will help you drink more slowly than if it were in the usual flat juice experience.<br /><br />I guess it's perfect for children since they are starting to sell this in schools as well.  But what about adults who have been trained to take on big drinks.  The size may be perfect if used alongside their meal, but what about in between meals?  I guess it's about time we are redirected in our thinking that if we are thirsty, then we drink water.  Unlike other products that advertises in quenching your thirst, this is not where it's heading.<br /><br />SO WHERE IS THIS PRODUCT HEADING?<br /><br />I can only surmise with the acquired taste and small size of this product, it will remain a niche product in a campaign toward healthier consumption.  In fact part of the image is being involved in a charity program that centers on needy children around the world.<br /><br />I would love to have them exist for a good cause, but I honestly won't go out and buy a product and force myself to like the taste so I can help educate the children.  If I wanted to do that then I'll simply find a non-profit organization that prides itself in maximizing contributions toward going to children than towards the running cost.<br /><br />In any case, I am not faulting the product for anything.  It's a product that certainly appeals to me and hopefully others who want a healthier option and know that water is their main source in quenching their daily thirst, but want something exciting in between.<br /><br />So three (3) starts because it's not a revolutionary product at this day and age, but at least it's something to consider."

So I bought a couple cases of these from Amazon. The nuts I recieved are just as fresh and crispy, but the spices on these containers for some reason are almost overwhelming. There are many nuts in the package that are caked with the mix of garlic, onion paprika, etc..., so much to the point that I have now taken to rinsing them off. This makes them a big soggy.., None the less, they are still a good value compared to the store prices, and you can rinse them , use them in recipes and they take just fine.

Of the 3 brother's freeze dried fruits that i ordered this one is the best.  i would put apple second on the list (as pretty good) and peach last (don't even bother. if you want tasty dried peaches try cripsy greens. they have great flavor compared to the brothers. the little bit of $ you save isn't wrth the compromise in flavor)
08	89429,B0014WYXQK,A1E371HE68KMWB,4/24/08,2,3,5,Refreshing and tasty!,"The Pomegranate flavor of Izze sparkling juice is a great choice for refreshment.  It contains 70% real juice, including a variety of juices one of which is pomegranate.  They remind me a bit of an italian soda.  It's nice to have a cold beverage option that is so natural and high on taste while being very refreshing.  The absence of any artificial additives or anything really unhealthy make this an all around great choice.  I really like them.<br /><br />The Blackberry flavor is even better, it has a really nice sweetness to it.<br /><br />I haven't tried any other flavors yet."
08	89430,B0014WYXQK,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,4/23/08,2,3,4,Free of high-fructose,"I like soda. I definitely drink too much of it, but it's one of the last I-know-how-bad-it-is-for-me things I allow myself in a time when most of the foods and drinks you see in the supermarket can best be described as ""mild poison."" Books and documentaries keep popping up telling us just how bad the foods are that we consume (Supersize Me, Fast Food Nation, The Omnivore's Dilemma, etc.), and one of the big offenders is the insidious high fructose corn syrup. They put it in everything, it seems, especially beverages. (Its worst aspect is that it blocks the receptors in your brain that tell you you're full and should stop eating or drinking, so you continue feeling hungry and eating and drinking more and more.) So it's refreshing to have a drink that's got a nice sweet flavor without this awful sweetener. Tastes will vary, but I found this pretty nice, and pomegranate's a flavor you don't normally see as a soda - or, ""sparkling juice"" - so I'd say this is worth a try. At the very least, it's more interesting than another boring ol' cola or lemon-lime soft drink.<br /><br />A note on the Clementine variety:<br />These Izze drinks are really quite nice. In addition to the lack of high fructose corn syrup, which is a major plus, they use really interesting flavors. This clementine flavored sparkling juice is cool variation. I thought it might taste more like a Sunkist-style orange soda, but it really doesn't. The clementine flavor is very distinctive. I don't think I've ever had a soda quite like it. Tastes great, very tangy, not nearly as sweet as I would have expected. A nice, cool drink for the spring.<br /><br />A note on the Grapefruit variety:<br />Much the same as the others, this is a nice change of pace for a fizzy drink. This is my wife's favorite flavor, though for me it's got a little less zest than I would have expected. Still, it fits nicely with the other flavors."

No worries about this cereal sitting in the closet as I've gone through 2 boxes already!  The cereal is light and tasty, with just the right amount of cinnamon and sweetness for me.  Mind you, I like just a hint of sweetness in my cereal - so don't expect anything sugary sweet.  Intend to order more once Amazon has stock."

08	22292,B000KV61FC,A2B54WBPCSXQI9,11/22/08,2,2,5,This thing was made for terriers,"My husband and I have two English Jack Russell Terriers under six months old. They're both much more interested in playing than eating, but my vet was adamant that letting them graze all day would make house training significantly more difficult.<br /><br />The answer has been to make their eating more of a challenge. We've got two oversized Kongs that we'll fill with their breakfast, but they eat out of the kongs very quickly. In the evening, we needed something that would keep the puppies busy for at least ten minutes, so one of us could get some food in our own mouths before it was time for the pack to go out.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug has been great. Both puppies are challenged by it, but not so challenged that they lose interest. There's a perfect balance between work and reward. It holds a lot of food and assorted small treats, it's pretty easy to load, and the beasts haven't figured out how to unscrew the bottom lid.<br /><br />Some of the pictures for this product on various websites show a rope. Mine actually came with a silicone ""rope"" that's got a cone shape at the end, which ensures something gets scooped to the neck almost every time they pull on it.<br /><br />Only downside for my two is that if the food drops below a certain level they lose interest... might be because it's too much work, or it might be because they're full. Either way I have to make sure to dump the leftovers into a kong or a dish at least once a week so they get to eat the food before it gets stale."
08	22293,B000KV61FC,A35U4HGXY7OOCX,10/12/08,2,2,3,"Kept her interest, then she destroyed it","My dog really enjoyed this. she spent hours trying to get the treats out. but in the first 10 minutes she chewed the plastic 'rope' in half out of frustration. So now the toy doesn't work as intended, but still i put her dog food in there since i know she'll be able to get it out pretty easily, it will just take more work than the bowl. This is a really great toy, just wish the rope would have lasted a day. so be sure to supervise play before you leave your dog with this one."

Whilst others may consider this a mistake, (as I did at first), I got to thinking....WHY NOT list it under ""Health amd Personal<br />Care""?  The ""health"" ingredients in this scrumptious little candy bar are as natural as most un-organic food -- especially candy -- is today,  Yes, I'll admit that ""sugar"", ""corn syrup"" and ""hydrogenated palm kernal oil may not be the best for one's diet....but they ARE natural products, not chemical facimilies.  The other ingredients are natural too....the one exception being ""artifical flavours"".  Oh, well...the scrumptious flavour of this treat...plus the money one saves by not buying fancier and/or organic chocolate, (at least, not all the time), can easily make a person sleep better at night, as the thought of bank interest compounding, (or stocks going up, etc.), leads to more relaxation, and better sleep!<br /><br />Also, ""3 Musketters"" has 45% less fat than other typical chocolate snacks!<br /><br />So much for ""Health"" benefits of ""3 Musketeers""!<br /><br />And ""Personal Care""?  You bet!  Eating one of these wonderous little bars makes one think one is eating a chocolate confection at the court of Louis XIV, Louis XV, or Louis XVI!  (And or the courts of Peter The Great,<br />King Mongut of Siam....or any other monarch, or at the mansion of any rich and famous person of your choice!)  It is SO easy to forget the ""gourmet"" quality of this smooth little treat, because it is so readily available in candy stores, mom-and-pop groceries, huge supermarkets, and online!  However, the smoothness of this confection, and it's sweet chocolate taste, should not be taken for granted!  There is NO sticky nougat, and NO ""pesky"" nuts, to draw attention from the wonderful texture and magnificient flavour!  (I have read that ""Preppie"" food is boneless...probably skinless and without fat, as well.  No difficulty in prying meat or fish for the upper classes!  So, too, can a readily-available ""3 Musketeers"" be considered an<br />""upper-class"" treat, even if it doesn't carry a huge price tag.  Nothing interferes with ""chewing pleasure""...it's just ""chocolate fluffiness"", covered with a darker chocolate topping!<br /><br />(True, if you favour ""rocky road"" ice-cream, then ""3 Musketeers"" Bars may not be for you.  But if you like your steak or fish fileted, and your flavour in your candy-bars to be sweet and true, ....THIS is your snack of choice....just as it is mine!)  Deluxe, inexpensive....wow!  What a bargain!  And it even has the ""OU"" (highest-quality kosher) symbol on each wrapper, as well!<br /><br />If you want to cut calories and fat still further...and/or want a second type of treat from your ""3 Musketeers"" bar, try ""volumiizing"" it.  ""Volumizing"" is a calorie-cutting technique, which can easily be done with a ""3 Musketters"" Bar.  Simply put some milk, (whole, skim or dry), intro a blender, add one or two ""3 Musketters"" bar(s), and whirl away!  Presto....the best ""Malt"" available, outside of the ones I used to have in a neighbourhood, Brooklyn, NY candy-shop as a child!  (In fact, you could even add malt, (Carnation Instant...also sold by Amazon.com), to make a super treat!  Or place ""3 Musketeers"" bars inside a cake batter, for an additional taste experience!  Recipes for this little gem of a snack seem endless!  And no nougat, sticky caramel, or nuts, to get in the way!<br /><br />One thing I miss from the ""3 Musketeers"" bars, as they now are packed, is a picture of Alexander Dumas' 3 Musketeers, themselves, For, of course, it is from this novel that the candy bar gets its name.  Althos, Porthos, D'Artagnon,....where art thou?  Thy pictures surely USED to be on this bar!  This scrumptious,  easily-eaten fluffy little chocolate concoction, which surely would be at home in any French, or other Royal Court, reallt needs your pictures on it again!<br /><br />In the meantime.....bite into this wonderful, easily eaten, chocolate confection masterpiece!  Don't let it's wide availabily make you think of it as a common candy bar...for it is truly a gourmet treat!"

Indeed, famed psychic Edgar Cayce stated that eating 5 almonds a day will prevent cancer.  So, eating them is a nice, healthy & tasty insurance policy--hard to beat.  Adding the  cocoa makes them far tastier too.  Not overly chocolatie, sweet without being cloying, they satisfy my sometime craving for a sweet.  They go well with some fruit (I tried fresh apricots)--but CAUTION, like a certain potato chip they're hard to stop eating.  I went through half the container before stopping.  I don't think they'll last too long on my shelf.  On the other hand, if you have a big sweet tooth (or maybe all of them are sweet--if you have any left after eating tons of chocolate), they may not be sweet or chocolatie enough for you.  They are for me.  Enjoy!"

Pomegranate is a great flavor, harder to find than some of the others.  I also really like grapefruit, blackberry and clementine orange Izzes.  Pear is great but I haven't been able to find it for quite some time."

Not to take anything away from the other guys, they roast some wonderful coffee too, but Larry's Beans is the master of blending beans from different regions to come up with very drinkable, delicious coffee.  Wjat sets Larry's Beans apart is that they are consistently less expensive than the other guys mentioned.  For this reason, Larry' Beans gets most of my business."
08	89449,B0014WYXQK,A1LH6RF4UN9VI6,5/14/08,0,0,3,A bit of a let down.,"I'm a fan of (most) Izze sodas and a big fan of pomegranate, so I thought this flavor would be a sure bet.  I was, however, disappointed.<br /><br />First up, the good.  The 8.4 ounce can size is perfect for a quick thirst-quencher.  While the calorie count is comparable to other regular sodas, it's a bit lower and consists of natural sugars from juices... not high fructose corn syrup. (What is that stuff anyway?) And, it's fizzy.  I like the fizz.<br /><br />Now for the bad: it barely tastes like pomegranate.  I realize that most folks would be turned off by an overly-tart, full force pom flavor; but the can promises pomegranate.  Yet reading the ingredients, pomegranate is listed fifth in the juice list. Fifth.  Behind apple, grape, pineapple, and lemon.  Oddly enough, the sixth juice: cranberry, seems to steal the show as that's the flavor I was able to notice other than the over-powering grape.<br />And that makes me sad.  Izze's other flavors (like grapefruit and clementine) really showcase the fruit on the label.  Just not here.<br /><br />If you'd rather have a sweet drink than a real pom experience, give this a shot. But if you're looking for some honest pomegranate flavor, look elsewhere."
08	89450,B0014WYXQK,A1WXG10FJ353K0,5/14/08,0,0,3,"Pomegranate: Oddly tastes more like grapefruit, with no grapefruit.","I have tried four flavors of the Izze drinks.  Pomegranate, Blackberry, Apple and Grapefruit.<br /><br />My main interest in the four was the Pomegranate, and it's surprising my least favorite.  First of all, it's bitter, tastes like grapefruit, contains no grapefruit, and their Grapefruit drink is sweeter and more enjoyable.  -- which I would have expected to be my least favorite.<br /><br />I never drink sugar, so Izze is a welcomed beverage alternative to aspartame sodas.<br /><br />All of their drinks have a white grape and apple juice base. And all from concentrate with a slightly sparkling water mix.  Not carbonated, just a little fizz.<br /><br />Slightly on the pricey side, but for pomegranate product, it's acceptable.  But the pomegranate comes after the grape juice, apple, pineapple, lemon and cranberry in the ingredient list."

Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

08	12165,B00141UC9I,AFA506P2CG3BK,8/1/08,1,2,5,Great Product,My dog is 11 years old and has a bad back. He is a VERY picky eater.  He LOVES these treats and asks for them if we forget to give him one. (Which is seldom because he is so spoiled) There is a bit more of a perk in his step since we've discovered this product. The cost here on Amazon is fantastic too because the stores have been charging me $7.99 a bag. (NYC prices yikes)
08	22364,B000CSCP0I,A301DV27GTJGIE,7/24/08,0,0,5,Love the individual servings of Special K,"My husband and I love these.  This is so much easier and nicer than cereal from a big box...  we find that we eat these often; and hardly ever ate cereal otherwise.  These are great to take to work.  The individual portion size helps us, and we love having the freshness these provide.  The cost is excellent as well.  And the container recyclable."
08	89451,B0014WYXQK,A2DKA8PMGZFXME,5/13/08,0,0,4,Fizzy Goodness,"I tried two flavors of these Izze cans - Clementine and Pomegranate.<br /><br />What I like: Real juice - no artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. Better for you than a soda. The smaller serving size is just right and the can is a comfortable shape to hold. I liked both of these flavors, with the Pomegranate coming out slightly ahead. Both were a nice mix of tart and sweet. They also make great vodka mixers.<br /><br />What could be better: These really need to be cold to be at their best in flavor and fizz. I often prefer drinks to be room-temp because my teeth can be cold-sensitive. If you're looking for a fizz fix, then there are flavored, unsweetened sparkling waters out there that would satisfy without any calories at all.<br /><br />Miscellaneous notes: As others have said before, be aware that the flavor juice is not necessarily the main juice (pomegranate), or even present at all (clementine). They're not a complete source of the fortified vitamins, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />It all comes down to what you're looking for. Looking for a sparkling juice that's relatively good for you? This is an excellent and recommended answer."

Now, she throws up may be once every 3-4 months. At first, I had to smear the paste on her nose to get her to lick it up. Now, I cannot keep her away from it. What can I say, I will be buying this in bulk! (PS: My cat was a stray that walked into my home from the backyard, probably a year old when she moved in - if it helps you decide whether my experience applies to your cat..)"
08	89452,B0014WYXQK,A146H6A41B26QT,5/10/08,0,0,5,How about a Dizzy Izze?,"My husband and I tried the pomegranate, which is tart and refreshing, but as I don't drink soda at all, I tasted a bit too much sugar for my taste. But something in the flavor put us in a creative frame of mind, and we decided to have a little fun. So we tried Izze pomegranate and vodka, Izze pomegranate and gin, and then both of these with some OJ. The OJ adds a definite sweet/citrus taste and is quite refreshing with or without the alcohol. This is how we named and rated them:<br /><br />1. Pomegranate/OJ/gin--a Bloody Orange<br />2. Pomegranate/gin--a Gin Izze<br />3. Pomegranate/OJ/vodka--an Izze Navel<br />4.

The first shippment came with one gift pack so I called customer sevice and they said to keep the one I got and they would reship the order. The next shippment came and was the same thing, one gift pack instead of 4, so I called again and they said they would send out two more. I waited weeks and nothing came, so I called again they could not tell me why I did not get my order, they asked if I wanted a refund for the last two gift packs I did not get, I really wanted the two gift packs but I said i would take the refund. Next I ordered some Doritos toasted corn, they come 6 in a order, I got all 6 but every bag had nothing but busted up corn chips. They were packed in a big box no packing around the bags.

08	89453,B0014WYXQK,A19PPFERQ3JFDS,5/8/08,0,0,4,A nice pick me up,"Soft drinks and sparkling water drinks rarely meet over due to their nature. Increasingly, like San Pellegrino, companies have decided to use a simple sparkling water and fruit juice blend to keep sugar contents down and your palatte refreshed.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Izze drinks for a while, but I really really like this Pomegranated Flavored Sparkling Juice. I have always been a fan of mixing almost anything with club soda or mineral water (tonic water has too much sugar... have you read the calories?)  to cut down the bite of some of the stronger juices and alcohols. Izze has done a nice job here. The pomegranate juice still retains it's acidic bite while the bubbly mineral water smoothens it out at the end. At 8.4 ounces, it's a nice little glass of juice and a perfect mid afternoon refresher with cheese or fruits. I'll be buying a few more packs of these!"

08	44635,B001EQ55RW,A3OC42X7H74D1Y,5/27/08,0,0,4,Get Set for a Nutty Surprise,"It occurred to me that sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. I didn't feel like a nut when I sat down to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, but my wife did and so we started undressing the beast.<br /><br />I undid the top of the plastic wrap, she unscrewed the cap, and then I finished the job by peeling off the airtight barrier that sealed the top of the container.<br /><br />And that's when it happened.<br /><br />My wife grabbed the first almond and popped it in her mouth. I could actually hear the crunch of her first bite. She's tough to please and especially cynical about packaged foods that try to appear ""new and different.""<br /><br />Her eyes lit up. ""Whoa, this is good.""<br /><br />I grabbed an almond. She was right.<br /><br />She reached for another, and then two or three more. I popped about five in my mouth and went for the full chew. Then she did the same.<br /><br />When we came up for air, we talked about how surprised we were. The almonds were dry roasted and really crunchy. We expected something closer to soggy, like almonds sometimes get. The cocoa coating gave just the slightest hint of dark chocolate, and the sweetness didn't come through until we ate more than one at a time.<br /><br />Maybe best of all was that there was no discernible salty taste.<br /><br />My wife said, ""I think they have a winner here."" I took another handful before I decided I agreed.<br /><br />In the end, it's just a nut. But, boy, what a nut."
08	57483,B000PDD0CW,A2MZ59SJR6FIW8,8/29/08,0,0,4,Only gave it 4 stars because,"of its' size. Pour milk in this bowl and by the time you eat it all it gets very soggy. It really is a lot of cereal in these bowls. Cereal is great, just wished I would have gotten the smaller size bowls."
08	44636,B001EQ55RW,A2Z60PVKWFO3SW,5/27/08,0,0,5,Delicious!,"I thoroughly enjoyed these almonds;  the almonds are fresh and crunchy, the cocoa not too messy or overpowering. The chocolate flavor is subtle, these are NOT milk chocolate covered almonds, and they are unlikely to stave off a true chocolate craving.  They're not really addictive either -- unlike salted nuts - I will plow through salted nuts until they are gone.  Nevertheless, they are still quite filling and satisfying.  A tasty change of pace."
08	89454,B0014WYXQK,A3PCS59M8DKBTT,5/6/08,0,0,4,A tad too sweet for my taste,"Izze makes some very good juices, and advertises that their juice contains nothing other than fruit juice and sparkling water.  These are undoubtedly far, far better for you than, say, a Coke or a Pepsi.  They taste better and are more refreshing, and they certainly have a more natural feel to them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that, like many juices that claim to be all fruit juice, the vast majority of the juice in this particular blend appears to be apple and grape, which are much sweeter fruits in comparison with the tarter flavors.  Everyone knows pomegranate is good for you, but my guess is that the percent of this juice that is actual pomegranate is quite small--perhaps as low as 2 or 3 percent--and so contrary to what other reviewers have said, any health advantages are quite minimal.<br /><br />All that being said, these are certainly a superior option to other soft drinks.  Just don't think these are as good as water."
08	22372,B001HTJ49G,AMZWWP4LFT932,1/14/08,3,3,4,GOOD STUFF!,"I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the ""average"" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again."
08	22375,B001HTJ49G,A2Y8IDC1FKGNJC,2/19/08,2,2,5,great snack,"These organic pretzels make a great little snack. They are light, yet filling. I like to dip mine in mustard or peanut butter for a change of pace. i will definitely be buying these again!"
08	49550,B001E5E268,A3D9TNJMK7GZYW,1/24/08,1,1,5,The BEST!!!,"This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try."
08	49549,B001E5E268,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,7/22/08,1,1,5,Good stuff!!,"Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.  I drink the first mug straight and the rest I put soy milk powder in.  GOOD STUFF.  Will continue to buy this tea."
08	49548,B001E5E268,A3MABADRI0B300,9/5/08,1,1,2,Bland,"Expected good, full flavor from this tea, recently having finished 2 packets of Japanese Gyokuro. It is bland, and the color of the steeped tea, an unattractive dark brown - with no hint of green."
08	44637,B001EQ55RW,A39ISGPKMF9X0R,5/27/08,0,0,5,Great Snack,"Okay I have to admit it I am hooked on these almonds. The cocoa flavor is subtle, and delicious. The packaging is clever, and easy on the hands. The fact that almonds are also beneficial and good for you doesn't hurt either. The unique lid allows me to keep up with portion control which is a good thing, otherwise I would probably empty the can. These Cocoa Roasted Almonds are like eating an almond candy bar without the guilt.<br />Highly recommended."
08	89455,B0014WYXQK,A1JOANG98KBFKU,5/4/08,0,0,4,"Pretty good, Could be a little sweeter.","I think the warnings about drug interactions should have no bearing on the product review. Obviously, if you're on a certain medication with known food interactions, you need to be cautious of certain foods. That shouldn't effect how we rate those products for the rest of the world. Medication concerns aside, the drink is very fruity, and refreshing. It is a very nice alternative to plain fruit juice or soda, and far healthier since soda contains no nutrition whatsoever.  This does taste very much like a fresh fruit juice spritzer with authentic flavor, not artificial in any way.  It doesn't have a ""canned"" taste as some fruit drinks in cans do.  I would have liked it to be a tad sweeter, but accomplished that by adding a splash of fresh fruit juice or a flavored syrup such as Torani. The flavor of the product itself is akin to an Italian soda.  I withheld one star because I thought the product straight from the can was a little overly ""fuzzy"" but fares well when poured over ice.  For those trying the pomegranate flavor, be forewarned that this is a ""blend"" including other fruit juices, not straight pom.  The flavor of pomegranate is still plentiful, but not like drinking it straight.  Overall, I think this would make a wonderful addition to the summer picnic cooler or to serve guests at a dinner party. Served in glasses, rather than a can, it would make an impressive dinner beverage to accompany an elegant meal for guests. I would recommend it."
08	22376,B001HTJ49G,A1SWWRBQ9HMUCK,1/10/08,2,2,5,Spelt Pretzels,"These are hearty tasting pretzels made with Spelt flour.  They have just the right amount of salt.  Even my husband won't eat regular pretzels anymore when I have these in the house.  The bonus is that nutritionally speaking, these are a healthier choice than white flour pretzels.  The only drawback is that a 7 oz bag gets eaten pretty quickly in my home!"
08	71979,B000E0TLEW,A1WINBPELZ0YAZ,2/7/08,2,4,2,Everlasting?  I don't know about that!,"One of my dogs (8 lbs)was able to remove the treat disc from the ball and promptly made a huge icky mess on their futon:(  The other pup (3.75 lbs) isn't as agressive a chewer, so it's fine for her.  I just have to figure out how to give it to the little one without the big one stealing it from her, lol!"
08	89456,B0014WYXQK,A1SBVY5DX5ZKUX,5/3/08,0,0,4,Serve cold for a refreshing taste!,"Although a little bitter, I do like the IZZE sparkling pomegranate carbonated fruit drink.  With a case of 24, I was able to share and get the opinions of friends and co-workers as well.  They noted the bitter taste but one friend mentioned how that could lend itself to be excellent in a mixed drink...come up with your own cool creation.<br /><br />Carbonated fruit drinks are always my favorite. I always mix ginger ale or club soda with my fruit juices.  It's especially great cold.  For me, the 8.4 oz size is perfect.  I tend to waste when I have 10 oz or more.<br /><br />This is something I would definitely buy and I would love to try the other flavors.  In addition, I love that IZZE has partnered w/Global Education Fund to help children around the world. A good drink, great cause...wonderful combination."

I am a fan of almonds anyway so it wasn't a stretch when you combine almonds with another one of my favorites, dark chocolate, and you have a winner.<br /><br />The almonds taste fresh and as always they are meaty and filling.  I can enjoy these at about 7 or 8 at a serving which seems to me to be about the serving size at _ cup.<br /><br />Although these aren't unhealthy in the sense that there is a lot of junk added they certainly are not a weight loss tool.  At 150 calories per serving and 110 of that from fat you would be in serious trouble if this replaced baby carrots on your menu.<br /><br />All in all a very tasty treat.  I give it four stars instead of five only because of the high fat content even if it is healthier fats."
08	44639,B001EQ55RW,A14OQ67LM79KW3,5/27/08,0,0,4,Very healthy and great taste,"All of the chocolate lovers loved these nuts!!A great alternative to candy and junk foods. My daughter grabbed them and claimed them as hers, so I's say this was a good deal!!!<br />The only thing one mAY or may NOT care for is this is not a soft, chocolate<br />covering but a dry, light covering.I think it tastes better as such and my daughter did not even notice.<br />The nuts were very good themselves.<br />This will go over well for the health and for the weight conscious persons.<br />For me, while I liked them, I am NOT a sweet lover and found them very sweet FOR ME. but I still would buy and eat them ...a few daily ...to get the benefits of dark chocolate and almonds."
08	42287,B000V1D19A,A3PDLKBXMVCLON,12/16/08,3,4,4,Amazingly easy way to prepare chicken,"I'm a bit fickle with Chicken. If it tastes even a little bit off I can lose my appetite for it. This paste makes a sauce that is quick and easy to make. Most of all, I like how the recipe makes sure the Chicken is COOKED by bringing it to a boil twice. And it tastes great over rice. I can't give it 5 stars because it doesn't measure up to the best curry I've ever tasted, but it's good enough that I have bought a couple 6-packs so far."
08	44640,B001EQ55RW,A1ZCSSCAGBCD49,5/27/08,0,0,5,Some pretty tasty nuts!,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked these nuts. At first I thought they were chocolate coated and sweet, but that's not the case. They are dusted in dark chocolate powder. That adds flavor but not a lot, if any, calories. A one oz. serving is 150 calories and yields 3 Weight Watcher Points instead of the usual four because of the high fiber count. Good deal. It satisfies two cravings in one serving. A very good way to get your nut goodness with some chocolate too. Enjoy!"

08	22421,B001HTJ49G,A9PKYI8B9V9VB,11/30/08,0,0,5,Best tasting pretzel snack,"I love the shape and taste of mini pretzels like these but don't like the flavor of wheat - so this is the perfect solution. Light on salt, baked just to perfection, with the slightly nutty taste of spelt. They don't overpower anything else I'm eating or drinking, very well balanced. Thanks Newmans' Own, another winner!"
08	80536,B001EO5ROA,ACDNL5KIFZEYO,12/29/08,6,6,5,Favorite Flavor!,"I have been very happy with this product!  I have tried almost all the  flavors, but the Valencia Orange is my favorite.  I feel it is the most versatile of the flavors available.  I have been using this for over a year now and enjoy it on a daily basis in my water bottle and also add it to my tea, iced or hot.  A little goes a long way.  It is not too sweet but very light and refreshing.  Highly recommended!"
08	44641,B001EQ55RW,A55PCTJ6NINET,5/27/08,0,0,4,Sort of an inverse chocolate bar,"I like these more than I thought I would. They're sort of the inverse of a chocolate bar with almonds: instead of a lot of chocolate and few almonds, you get a lot of almonds and a little chocolate flavor. My personal preference tends toward high-cacao percentage chocolates, so the minimal sweetness here was not a problem for me. Also, and unlike conventional chocolate-covered nuts, these will not turn into a lumpy, gooey, mess if you leave them in the car this time of year."
08	89457,B0014WYXQK,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,5/2/08,0,0,5,Delicious--Refreshing--Tart,"In a nutshell this is a refreshing drink. It is sparkling and has pomegranate juice in it. It is a bit tart in a good, thirst quenching kind of way.<br /><br />Not only do I like it, but my seven year old child loves it too.<br /><br />I prefer to chill it and to pour it into a glass before serving."
08	44642,B001EQ55RW,A21W7ZA2FZKOGP,5/27/08,0,0,5,Yummilicious Chocolate-y Goodness,"These almonds are one of my favorite snacks. If you're trying to eat healthier but still crave a little sweetness or chocolate, this is the way to go. It can be a little dangerous to your diet if you eat TOO many at once but it makes you feel less guilty than some other snacks. I like that they aren't too sweet or too chocolate-y. You still taste the almonds despite the sweet coating. This is a product that I'll be buying again."
08	85667,B000EM8UPQ,AVG9AD5L73068,10/15/08,4,4,5,The BEST ever!!!,I have used mix this for over 20 years.  I have friends from the West to East coast who love my Enchiladas.
08	22422,B001HTJ49G,AVSN0J4VQ5HLG,11/15/08,0,0,4,yummy pretzels!,"I bought these for my husband for healthy snacking in the evening,and they are great! High in fiber and protein, but low in calories per serving.  Even my 5 year old (who does not eat anything!)will eat these pretzels.<br />They are crispy, and slightly nutty tasting. I will always have a case on hand."
08	43719,B0049ZCF9G,A361PLXEWB9UC1,3/25/08,1,2,5,wow  really,"So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up."
08	89458,B0014WYXQK,AX54G5AL870Q8,5/2/08,0,0,3,I didn't like the Pomegranate as much-It didn't taste as good as I had hoped,"i want to preface this by saying I do not drink carbonated beverages, but was hoping the IZZE drinks were closer to fruit drinks.  I think I would have liked this more if if weren't so tart, but I think others who enjoy carbonated drinks will like it.  this review is for the pomegranate flavor drink."
08	42285,B000V1D19A,A2RDB0UC8PDFRE,5/9/08,1,1,5,Very Tasty,"A big taste comes in a little pouch!  This curry is very fragrant and flavorful.  It is extremely easy to prepare.  It has the perfect amount of ""spicy"" to it.  My house smells like an Indian restaurant! :)"
08	80526,B000PNKJWQ,A2T135XHAH82S4,3/8/08,4,4,5,Good Price,Good price for the Chex Snacks.<br />Quick delivery and arrived in good condition.<br />Will order again...I have been quite pleased with the Amazon Grocery purchases I've made over the last few months.

Not too big, not too salty, not too dry, never a burnt taste, just right for MY tasty taste buds! You ought to try Newman's Own Organics Spelt Pretzzels! Nell Newman really came up a winner with these! Snacking or dipping...they are GREAT! jpg/UT"
08	89459,B0014WYXQK,A1CK5CZ714F34T,5/1/08,0,0,4,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!,"I wish this product wasn't made from concentrate, but this type of drink is so new, eventually someone will do it.  Having said that, this IS refreshing and delicious drink.  The small size is perfect.  Mine even arrived cold!"
08	89460,B0014WYXQK,A1B4MIXYVIKMU2,5/1/08,0,0,3,Too sour and bitter for my taste,"The Izze all natural Pomegranate drink is a great idea.  A Natural drink with no artificial sweeteners or even refined sugar. Best of all, no corn syrup.  It sounds like a nice healthy drink, right?  Well, the reality is that it just didn't taste very good to me. And, although it claims to have 70 percent juice... most of the juice isn't Pomegranate juice.<br /><br />Here's the rundown:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-All Natural<br />-No refined sugar or corn syrup added<br />-70 percent juice content<br />-Fortified with vitamins<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Doesn't taste good. Sour, bitter, and tastes more like wine than juice.<br />-Most of the juice isn't pomegranate... it's a mix of apple, pear...etc<br />-Isn't sweet enough... they could have used raw sugar, I wouldn't mind.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I just didn't like the taste of it. It may be more healthy for you than most other drinks... but if it doesn't taste good, what's the point? I expected it to taste like pomegranate, and it totally didn't. There's not even much pomegranate juice in it. Though, if you are into wine, you may like it. It tastes more like wine than juice."
08	44643,B001EQ55RW,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,5/27/08,0,0,5,Satisfying Chocolate Taste with the Almonds!,"These roasted almonds are coated with cocoa baked onto the outside of the nut. They are made in a way that the cocoa leaves no powder on the hands for no-mess eating, no stickiness, no powder, no mess. These are dry, these are not chocolate candy covered. The cocoa has a strong chocolate taste and is not sweet, it is delicious. The nuts also taste great.<br /><br />This would satisfy a chocolate craving. The great taste of the almonds and cocoa together is delicious!"
08	89461,B0014WYXQK,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,4/30/08,0,0,4,Soda Juice,"In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself.  But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water?  Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good!  Apple and Blackberry were both rather mild tasting; Clementine and Grapefruit a little stronger and more tart; and Pomegranate had the strongest taste.  I'd say Pomegranate and Grapefruit were my favorites, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 flavor choices: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The only difference between Izze in the cans and Izze in the bottles, other than the obvious of size and container, is that only Izze in the cans is fortified with vitamins: C, B6, and Niacin, plus the fact that currently <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NUBTQQ"">Izze Sparkling Blueberry Soda (12 ounce)</a> and Izze Sparkling Peach Soda (12 ounce) are only available in bottles.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used.  Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit have the highest calories, 90, Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 80.  Apple, Blackberry, and Clementine have the highest sodium, 15mg; Grapefruit and Pomegranate the lowest, 10mg.  Apple and Blackberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 21; Clementine, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate the lowest, 20.  Finally Apple has the highest sugars, 21g; Blackberry and Grapefruit are next, 20g; and Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 19g.<br /><br />Note: as other reviewers have already mentioned, all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice.  All contain white grape, apple, and lemon juice.  In addition to their title juices Blackberry contains raspberry; Grapefruit contains orange; and Pomegranate contains clarified pineapple and cranberry juice.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDDHPQ"">essn Sparkling Blood Orange & Cranberry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWG"">essn Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001687ZT4"">essn Sparkling Mango & Passion Fruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDGA5A"">essn Sparkling Meyer Lemon Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), and essn Sparkling Pomegranate & Montmorency Cherry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).  The difference?  The essn products lack the vitamin fortification, have a higher carbonated water to juice ratio, and have roughly twice the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of the Izze products, probably because they contain the fruit pulp, which the Izze products do not."
08	22424,B001HTJ49G,A102UXGLDF76G1,3/31/08,0,0,5,Top notch snack!,"In my search for healthy snacks I found this item: Organic, high in fiber, low in fat and they use sea salt. They sound like they should be boring, but they are just as good if not better than any pretzel out there.<br />I can eat 20 of them for only 2 points on my Weight Watchers program and that is a whole lot more than other snacks. They're very filling with a piece of cheese or two which is extremely important when watching what you are eatting!<br />I highly recommend them to anyone!"
08	22425,B001HTJ49G,A17KNP1347GV5D,2/12/08,0,0,5,Best Pretzels I've Ever Had!,These pretzels are absolutely delicious!  I did not notice the excess salt or burnt flavor some other people experienced - we loved them!
08	42284,B000V1D19A,A3FKPBNI7UWQFW,6/21/08,1,1,5,Better than the Restaraunts!,"When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception. Plus, many of them include Classical Indian Music CDs that are extremely good."
08	42283,B000V1D19A,AMQN84KPHJV0Z,6/29/08,1,1,5,Way better than I expected!,"Any negative reviews you find of this product would have to be from Indian restaurants worried about losing business! I don't review many things, but was so impressed with the flavor and ease of use of this product... will now be a major staple of our kitchen!"
08	12129,B00141UC9I,A18OUXLIXAXA9S,6/9/08,0,0,5,great treat for our yorkie,"This is a great treat for our yorkie.  She loves the duck and it is good for her.  Please read the amount to give your size dog.<br />Thanks,  Brian"
08	49526,B001E5E268,A3KY6HIM0HCIGG,1/21/08,3,3,5,Excellent breakfast tea!,"I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.  If you only have a little left in the tin, it blends well with any other black tea."
08	89462,B0014WYXQK,A3Q4TYJVAM4IRM,4/29/08,0,0,5,"Pleasantly sophisticated tasting, in a reasonable portion","I've been a fan of IZZE drinks for some time.  The taste is sophisticated, the ingredients are natural, and the stuff is pretty to look at in a clear glass.  It's casual enough to drink with your lunchtime sandwich but it wouldn't be out of place served with H'ors deurves or in a nicer setting in place of sparkling water or wine.<br /><br />For this flavor, pomegranate juice is several entries into the ingredient list.  That means the pomegranate flavor is not very pronounced (though it's there), which may be a good thing since the juice normally packs a major flavor punch.<br /><br />I'd describe the carbonation as light-to-medium, pleasant like sparkling water rather than burn-y like Coke.<br /><br />This drink is now labeled ""Fortified"" but tastes the same to me as the previous non-fortified version; some additional vitamins have been added according to the label.<br /><br />Other thoughts: It's nice to see a reasonably sized portion (both in quantity and calories, only 80) in this era of supersized food, and supersized people.  The lightweight aluminum can is an enviro-friendly way to package drinks.  Recycle it!"
08	42282,B000V1D19A,A3JMHOP4RE7VUW,8/2/08,1,1,5,Tasty and Easy,Simply put these packets are easy to use and yield a good result when you want Indian in a pinch. I modified the recipe on the packet by adding chopped onion and some leftover roasted potatoes making the result more of a complete meal.  The salt content is a little high but overall the quality is excellent for a concentrate.

I'm an Indian and a cook, and God, did they taste good!! These are the best Indian gourmet sauces I have ever tasted in the US, and believe me I've tried a LOT of products. I wish they start selling them in the Midwest too.<br /><br />-S"
08	43716,B0049ZCF9G,A3QCNV2EMVXLKC,12/1/08,0,0,5,Love these,"Love these - very flavorful and wholesome.  I'm hooked!  Unlike the heavily oiled/salted/roasted almonds found in most grocery stores, these actually taste like real food."
08	66942,B000RHUXRQ,A2QV2HJU88PCTL,11/16/08,4,4,1,Disappointing,"I had read about, tasted and really liked this distinctive style of black pepper obtained from another vendor (World of Spice?). So when placing an order with Angelina's, I included this item and was very pleased by the price. However, they were completely nondistinctive, from the beginning. I don't know if they were stale from the start, or not what they were represented to be, or as the Test Kitchen recently reported -- not all tellicherry peppercorns are alike from different vendors. Anyway, while I generally like Angelina's products and believe this vendor is a good one, I give a thumbs down to this particular item. Try them from another vendor."

08	80515,B001EO5ROU,A2DCDQYG0GDX4Y,1/13/08,0,0,5,Best sweet tea on earth,"This is amazing tea. It is a ""pick-me-up"" for your immune system. Great for colds, flu, congestion, pneumonia, etc. It is naturally sweet with stevia leaf. Wonderful for preventitive measures as well."
08	49521,B001E5E268,A1B54NV7RNRBO4,1/5/08,4,4,5,My favorite!,"I've started each morning off with this particular tea for the last 5 or 6 years. I love this tea. I went from a coffee drinker to a green tea drinker because of this tea. It has nice a strong flavor that I simply adore. (I make it much stronger then suggested, I love bitter tastes! Then I just add hot water to the leaves for the second cup, and it is as good as the first!) I have been purchasing this from Stash directly for years, but it is a better deal on Amazon."
08	66966,B000KND8RY,A2LNHRXQ2DNC4U,10/15/08,1,1,5,Agave Nectar Light,"I first became acquainted with this yummy yet healthy nectar from the Arizona cactus at my favorite breakfast place, Coyote Pause (cool name, no? Yes!). The waitress brought a small serving of it with my french toast and asked me to try it. She said she often uses it in place of honey. It is really delicious and as the name suggests, light. It's a slightly thinner texture than honey but oh so sweet. I would encourage you to try it, too! I think you will like it."
08	71899,B000CQ25TQ,AVI6646PXN88,5/7/08,1,1,5,NOT SALTY,"I don't know why someone would say that this is salty, but I have never thought that.  It is great!  My family has been eating this mac n cheese once a week (at least) for over a year.  It is a big crowd pleaser. And amazon.com has a great price... it is $4 a box at the supermarket."
08	71898,B000CQ25TQ,AZJD7VC903ZD5,5/15/08,1,1,5,the best taste in mac and cheese,"I used to tolerate eating the blue box of mac and cheese because my husband and son ""liked"" it.  One day I saw this and said you can eat your blue junk and I'll eat this nice healthy box.  That night changed their minds.  They ate all of my box and we threw the blue box out to the birds.  There is no brand out there, I mean no brand - that can come close to the taste and health benefits of this product.  I add a full cereal bowl of cooked organic frozen peas to the box to make the mac and cheese into a whole protein meal.  It's a very nice and easy way to get a complete meal.  This Amazon price is way lower than my grocery store."
08	71894,B000FKIYMG,AE0OKUSKSDLX7,10/27/08,0,0,5,PepOMint,LifeSavers PepOMint is perfect for the office.  I am a new executive assistant and I put a bowl of mints out on my desk.  I have met more people as they stop to get a mint that I ever would have.  Today's environment does not lend itself to face to face talking - LifeSavers was my icebreaker!

I give them to them after they finish their breakfast and they bark at me if I forget!  I like the fact that they have no fillers or artificial ingredients because my dogs have food allergies. These treats are the greatest!

08	29563,B000PDY3P0,A2WUONPQDQ42N6,6/17/08,2,4,4,"Not bad, but a bit salty.","Still doesn't really compare to genuine ""theater"" popcorn, but not bad overall.  A bit salty, and too many unpopped kernels.  Compared to ""Mega Pop"", almost the same.  Just can't beat the real thing at the theater."
08	44644,B001EQ55RW,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,5/27/08,0,0,5,Yum yum,Imperial is the brand I choose when buying nuts in the Dollar General store because it costs less than the others and the quality is good.  I had no idea they made such a gourmet treat as these Cocoa Roast Almonds but I'm certainly glad they do.  I was wondering if the coating of cocoa powder could be inhaled and cause choking (I've choked on dry cocoa powder dusted on the top of other foods) but they've added some potato start to make the coating stay put.  The dry roasted almonds are of a nice size and quality and the flavor is very good.  I think maybe they could be a bit less sweet and more dark-chocolately but still they're good and once you start eating them it's hard to stop so beware there.  These go great with a glass of Yellow Tail Cabernet Sauvignon.
08	71880,B001E52VLG,A2MGVHMP38PC0R,7/28/08,0,0,5,Very Flavorful,"This is my favorite of the Crystal Light drinks. Very refreshing and doesn't have that ""after diet"" taste."

08	16038,B000NY8OVK,A1XA078YZRA3DU,8/14/08,8,10,2,Terrible Customer Service from Euro Food Mart,"I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service provided by Euro Food Mart."

08	89463,B0014WYXQK,A2CR57GAJKNWVV,4/28/08,0,0,4,Satisfying with just enough of a tang to make your mouth water,"If you're like me, you try to steer clear of colas and especially anything with high fructose corn syrup, yet you're a bit nervous of the calorie count from, say, orange juice, and you like a bit of sparkle to your drinks, as well. When I saw IZZE, it looked like the ideal solution. It's got a bit of fizz, real fruit juices, and a few vitamins. At 80 calories per 8.4 oz can, it won't break your diet, and it doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />So, how does it taste?<br /><br />Actually, it's pretty good. The pomegranate flavor gives it a nice tang without being overwhelming. The carbonation is light, just enough to give the drink a bit of extra zip without being threatening to overwhelm your stomach. And IZZE is sweet enough that I can enjoy it as a sort of reward for a workout, without being sticky or overly-sweet the way some traditional soft drinks can be.<br /><br />As a test, I tried one can at room temperature--it's a test I won't repeat. But served nicely chilled and straight out of the refrigerator or over ice, IZZE is an enjoyable treat--without completely busting the calorie count."

08	89464,B0014WYXQK,AE12AEJFCOGGY,4/28/08,0,0,4,A refreshing beverage,"We first started buying Izze drinks when my wife was pregnant and she was looking for alternatives to soda and coffee. The Izze products were among her favorites -- especially the Black Cherry flavor. The Pomegranate variety is tasty as well, consisting of 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water. They make for a refreshing drink, although not a very large one (just over 8 ounces). One thing to note is that these drinks have 80 calories each, so that is something to be aware of. They're better than soda, but are far from calorie-free."

The only warning I would give is to measure out a 1 serving size and put the container away or you may be in trouble, they are hard to stop once you get started.<br /><br />I plan on chopping some and sprinkling over fat free ice cream for a real treat without the guilt.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with these almonds, if you love dark chocolate or any chocolate for that matter give these a try.<br /><br />Amazon has the best deal on them also.

08	89465,B0014WYXQK,A3MPV6UPZ3LLAM,4/26/08,0,0,4,Sparkling and Light,"Wow!  Izze is a bright taste indeed.  Major Plus Factors: It is neither too sweet, too heavy, or loaded with any kind of additives. It is a healthful drink and this factor alone makes it ideal for people who search for alternatives to those ghastly flavored, carbonated sugar water soft drinks like coke or pepsi, etc, or other type of fruit drinks loaded with high fructose corn syrup which create false hunger and are so toxic to the liver.  AND, Izze is FREE of the dangerous caffeine junk that fries your nervous system like some of those such as red bull, etc. guzzled by silly ""celebrities"".  Izze is carbonated which works for my husband, albeit it is not my personal preference.  That said, Izze is great in fruit smoothies adding a lift with the fizz. I experimented by adding it to regular, unsweetened Dole orange/pineapple fruit juice and it really punched up that concoction. My taste buds were twangin'! I also see this used to add zip to homemade fresh fruit sauces,(think all kinds of berries, peaches, apricots, etc) for use over ice cream or frozen yoghurt sundaes, or in fruit shakes, custards, and yummy syrups over pancakes and waffles. The fact that is has zero sugar is a major plus for diabetics as well as those who seek alternatives to sugar overload. For those who do want a sweeter taste, I suggest adding a mere eighth teaspoon of Xylitol which I use in place of sugar because it is healthful and tastes just like sugar. AND, Xylitol doesn't adds a single calorie. Nor will it skew blood sugar values or promote sugar high and low crashes. This small addition of Xylitol really punches up the overall taste.  Bottom Line: This family really likes Izze for it's clean, sparkling and light taste plus the health benefits of the pomegranate fruit in this specific drink."
08	89466,B0014WYXQK,A2F6NONFUDB6UK,4/26/08,0,0,3,Far superior to your local vending machine,"Izze Beverages offers a variety of aromatic and refreshing line of drinks that are healthier and better-tasting alternative to soft drinks. Consisting of all natural ingredients (70% juice and sparkling water) and with no added sugars or caffeine, Izze's drinks are simply a better choice for you and your body. With a creative blend of juice concentrates -- for example, the pomegranate drink consists of apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate juice -- the taste experience is far, far superior to almost any drink you'll be likely to find in your local vending machine.<br /><br />Interestingly, Izze is packaged in 8.4 fluid ounce cans. A trade-off in using natural fruit juices is higher calorie content, so perhaps the tall, slim design of the can and its smaller volume is intended to help offset, both psychologically and materially, the reality of consuming an 80 calorie drink.<br /><br />However, Izze does not fare as well with competitive products from R.W. Knudsen whose drinks are made with 100% juice and are offered in 12 fluid ounce cans for about the same price as Izze. But perhaps more tellingly, Knudsen does not feel compelled to fortify their drinks with needless vitamins nor do they wear their corporate philanthropy on their sleeves to the extent that Izze feels compelled to do. One wonders if all this might be due to Pepsi's acquisition of Izze in 2006; the benefit of Pepsi's sales and distribution network might have come at the cost of marketing hyperbole and the production of a slightly less desirable product.<br /><br />Still, Izze shows that the soft drink industry is on the right track. If you normally consume artifically-sweetened soft drinks, choosing to enjoy the unique taste experience of Izze's all-natural product line (with delicious specialty flavors such as grapefruit and pomegranate) should be an easy decision for you to make. But if you are a little more finicky and prefer an 100% juice drink, you might also look into some of the other alternatives that are available to you."

The Fiesta brand is one that I'm very familiar with.  I grew up in San Diego where it's easy to get authentic mexican food and a large Horchata, and I always remembered the Fiest logo on the drink mixers.  So when I found out I could get the same thing at home, I knew I wouldn't have to look any further for the Horchata taste I know and love."

You can find these packages of mini Ritters all over Germany they are so popular, but I have only seen their larger individually-wrapped cousins here on the shelves.  As with any variety pack, you get much more of a choice of experiences--some old, some new.  I think the biggest advantage to ordering this package was that I got to try so many of the Ritter Sports that I had not ever tried before.  The only disadvantage I can think of is that the chocolates were not as fresh, of course, as they are in Deutschland.  But I guess you'll have to go there to know what I mean!"

It is indeed tasty, a mix of several juices and sparkling water. The more expensive pomegranate comes in fifth out of five juices in terms of content, but the pomegranate taste predominates. There are 80 calories in the 8.4 oz. can, so it's not like diet soda, but it's a refreshing alternative when you feel that you can stand a few calories."

Even our teenage son finds it refreshing and just sweet enough.<br /><br />The mix of pure fruit juice and sparkling water is nicely balanced and the fact that it is ""vitamin fortified"" is a plus factor. At the very least it helps rationalize drinking this tasty canned juice.  And who know, it might even be good for you!<br /><br />Personally, I am especially fond of the sparkling pomegranate and like to dilute it with an equal amount of club soda or just cool water.  It also makes a great mixer for all kinds of drinks, alcoholic or not.<br /><br />I hope this drink catches on and that other exotic flavors are added to the product line.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for those who like fruit flavored drinks in nice packaging and handy sized containers."

I like that it is not super-sweet and only sparkles moderately, quite pleasant and refreshing actually.<br /><br />Second Sips...<br />We both come to the conclusion that it almost has a wine-y taste, as if one were drinking an alcoholic beverage - maybe due to the grape juice? My husband also remarks that it would probably be great as a mix with alcohol, but let's not go there for the purpose of this review :-)<br /><br />Conclusions...<br />We like it better than we thought we would, especially my husband who at first was very skeptical of the idea of having to drink sparkling pomegranate juice. It is quite refreshing and a great thirst quencher on hot days although I am not sure that it is something other than a regular, not-so-sweet soda. I don't have much to say about the added vitamins - I, for one, don't need them but they likely won't hurt either.<br />We will probably buy this again from time to time, just for a change from the same-old sodas in our fridge..."

Now with Izze, I have a company that has taken that idea and created a line of sparkling beverages.  I just drank my first can of Sparkling Pomegranate.  I found the taste to be enjoyable, with just the right amount of fizz.  These are rather small cans, being tall and skinny and holding 8.4 oz.  There is very little sodium and no refined sugars, though natural sugar does amount to 19g for a can.  I liked the fact that it was all natural fruit juice.  The only thing to note is that this is not 100% Pomegranate, it is a mix of apple, white grape, pineapple and cranberry with pomegranate.  Very nice smooth taste and something I would purchase."

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the Wellness has no oils in it to keep his skin moist.

08	89474,B0014WYXQK,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,4/23/08,0,0,3,A Decent Alternative To Soda,"Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a nice alternative to the normal breeds of soda such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Dr. Pepper.  It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.<br /><br />The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.<br /><br />In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.  This item will probably fit best in the health niche market, and I don't see it hurting the sales of Sunkist any time soon.  Give it a shot if you are looking for a Coca-cola subsitute."

If you like a sweet soda you probably won't like this since it is very tart, I was surprised at how tart this was. It has a good fizz to it and is 80 calories per can, the cans are only 8.4 oz so it is smaller than other types but is refreshing. I would recommend this soda since it is a healthy alternative to other types of soda."

I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work."

It tastes great on its own, and would probably also work well as a mixer (with a small scoop of natural vanilla ice cream?) -- the possibilities are limitless.<br /><br />I just got this juice today, and decided to give it the most extreme test I have -- drinking some right after finishing a little bit of exercise.  I was very pleasantly surprised; after drinking this juice, I felt more refreshed and even a bit more filled than other juices of this type.  (And for a dieter, this is a big-time plus.)<br /><br />Note that this isn't a sweet juice; if you're seeking that, look elsewhere.<br /><br />However, as a natural juice (unsweetened by anything save the fructose of the fruit itself), it has a fine, full-bodied taste that is worth savoring over a tall glass of crushed ice.  It's a bit similar to natural cranberry juices; if you like those, you will like this.<br /><br />Four stars, recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey"

No sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This particular blend is described as pomegranate, but it's a mix of apple, grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. Overall it's tart and refreshing, not too sweet. However, the taste of grape and cranberry rather overpowers the pomegranate. Also, with the recent focus on pomegranate as a particularly healthy juice, it would be nice if the pomegranate-to-everything-else ratio was higher, so I'm only going to give it 4 out of 5.<br /><br />As to the fortification, as with most fortified foods it's more of a selling point than something of real value. You're better off getting your vitamins from a healthy diet, or (if you must) a multivitamin tablet.<br /><br />However, I'll keep drinking Izze when I feel an urge to drink soda. It may not be the healthiest drink, but it's a lot healthier than the high fructose corn syrup and chemical flavorings sold by the two big name soda makers."

08	89478,B0014WYXQK,A3P3U42S4A2YHQ,4/27/08,1,2,5,A Refreshing Change,"So, I havent even seen this product in a store near where I live, but do like to try new foodstuffs- so I was happy to order it as part of the vine program.  I was a little trepidatious about drinking it at first, but decided to pop the top of seven or eight cans (not all at once!) and drink quite a few before I reviewed it.  Now that I have that out of the way I can write a quick review.<br /><br />This soda is different.  Different good. Its got a taste that reminds me of Red Bull without the caffeine buzz.  On first sip, its got a funky aftertaste like beer, but then delves into a more tart, bitter taste before the natural sugars of the fruit juice come into play.  It tastes more like cranberry than pomegranate to me, and the others that I have shared this soda with with agree with me on that point.<br /><br />True, its not full of artifical sugars and so this soda isnt a sweet taste like we are all used to with carbonated beverages.  Its more ""dry"" in flavor and tastes like fruit juice mixed with seltzer water.  Not a bad taste, mind you, but one that takes two or three cans before it grows on you.  I like this soda, and if the stores in my area ever decide to stock it, I will happily pick up a case and even adventure out into other flavors to try.  Heck, I might have to shop on Amazon so I can pick some up every now a then  :)<br /><br />I dont give this soda to my kids, because to me, it has a more ""grown-up"" flavor to it.  Its not sugary and sweet and syrupy like modern soda, but it does have a refreshing, fresh, tart flavor that is surprisingly good.  At 8.4 ounces per can, it is a bit smaller than the 12oz. sodas we usually see, but this wasnt even a issue to me.  I like this stuff and cant wait to try the other flavors.  Trust me on this, do not jude this stuff by the first can alone.  Drink a couple and then form your opinion.  Good stuff, a refreshing change from Coke and Pepsi products."
08	89479,B0014WYXQK,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,4/23/08,1,2,5,Yum!,"This is by far the best of the Izze flavors.  It's light and delicious, and compared to the others I've tried (all but Apple) it easily tops the list.  The beverage is surprisingly thirst-quenching for such a slim, tiny bottle, and the best thing is that it's also quite versatile.  Too tired after work to break out multiple bottles and shake up a cocktail?  Just add two shots of your favorite brand of Vodka or Gin to one of these babies, cold out of the fridge, and drink up.  It's a light, fantastic way to relax.  The beauty of Izze drinks is that they aren't heavily carbonated like soda, so they don't really go flat, and they aren't heavily sugared like most juices, so they don't overwhelm your palette.  I couldn't recommend this product more highly.  Enjoy!"
08	1246,B001209QMU,A39EBYCBC6A62Z,3/27/08,0,1,5,Too good to be true.,"After years of drinking Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster and some others, I have found the holy grail of energy drinks. It kicks in within 2-3 minutes and it lasts an entire work day. After seven hours or so, you gradually come down. There is no anxiety or disphoria when it wears off. You just get very sleepy when you finally rest.<br /><br />Redline Power Rush is the very best product on the market. If it were illegal I would buy it on the black market. 'Nuff said."

However, it is not as sweet as other stevia products; I find myself using a squirt of it instead of ""just a few drops"" as it says in the description.  I would still recommend it though because it is a lot less expensive than other stevia flavorings I have found."
08	89480,B0014WYXQK,AIAS4YFLHJWW6,4/22/08,1,2,5,Delicious and Refreshing!,"The Izze Pomegranate sparkling juice is a bit tart, but very tasty.  Along with pomegranate, there are the definite flavors of apple and cranberry juices, which make for a refreshing cocktail.  The can is small, but 8.4 ounces is just enough juice, and at only 80 calories per can, this is a better choice for dieters than many of the other sparkling juices on the market.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to enjoying a cold, refreshing Izze on a hot Texas summer day, and I plan to check out all the juices in the Izze line.  Clementine is next!"
08	89481,B0014WYXQK,A14638TGYH7GD9,4/22/08,1,2,5,"Refreshing, delicious, and stylish","Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is not too sweet, but it is just as refreshing and fun as sugary soft drinks. The cans are small and stylish, perfect for carrying in your purse or backpack. Kids like it, and the smaller size makes it a more sensible serving.<br />The company is ecologically and socially responsible, too.<br />What's more, this flavor is very nice with a touch of Cointreau for a sophisticated and festive cocktail.<br />An excellent alternative to sodas."
08	89486,B0014WYXQK,A17JVVAKWEB0M,5/14/08,0,1,4,"Strong, less sweet taste","If you are used to Hawaiian Punch, Snapple, sugary Kool-aid, or other ""fruity"" drinks, you won't find the same high fructose corn syrup kick in this product.  It actually tastes like real fruit juice...imagine that.<br /><br />I'll admit I like sweet fake-fruit drinks as much as the next person, so my first few sips of Izze's pomegranate sparkling water made me question my selection.  I had expected something more akin to lightly flavored water, but the taste was an overwhelming tartness.<br /><br />I have learned to enjoy though and wish my parents had given me this as a kid so that my tastebuds would consider this ""sweet"".  It is still a little strong and tart for me, so I mix it 1-to-1 with water.  Diluted by half is still enough flavor for me, so each 12 once can actually doubles in size when I drink it.<br /><br />Lastly, everything about the company suggests they will appeal to progressive-minded individuals, from their use of all natural products, their green endeavors (factories powered by wind) and their philanthropic operations."
08	89487,B0014WYXQK,A10Y0CLCJ1L4LA,5/1/08,0,1,4,"Izze drinkable? Yes, he is.","I've been enjoying my Izze Pomegranate juice, and I'll tell you why:<br /><br />1. It's crisp and refreshing. Since it is mostly fruit juice and carbonated water, the only sugar is naturally occuring in the juice.<br /><br />2. It has 70% real fruit juice. The benefits of that are spelled out on the nutritional facts label. 10% of your daily vitamin C, B6 and niacin is in every can.<br /><br />3. The absensce of high fructose corn syrup. That heavy, ubiquitous sugar substitute we find in nearly every processed food in America these days, especially in the soft drinks. Izze has none of that.<br /><br />One gripe - The cans are small at 8.4 ounces. That usually leaves me wanting more. It's an encouraging sign that people are willing to eat food in small quantities like this, but making these closer to the size of a typical soda can and adding another 20-30 calories would be great."

It is a great product for easy convenience."
08	46259,B0000DGG4Y,A7IKOAH6M8WAC,4/7/08,11,12,4,Not Exactly what I Expected,"First off, my true gut feeling on the rating is a three.  I am giving it a four because the I think the company is really good, the product was shipped fast and was packed really well.  I am not super happy with the Trident Maple Forest but I am not totally disappointed either.  I really didn't know what to expect since this item had not been reviewed before, I couldn't find too many photos, and I have never ordered anything that is alive on the internet.<br /><br />My main disappointment is probably due to my own ignorance with bonsais.  I have had a few various bonsais before and have sadly killed them all.  I had seen the Trident Forest in a brochure before and really wanted it awhile ago.  The idea of a ""mini forest"" sounded really neat.  I also love maple trees so it really seemed perfect.  When I received my bonsai today I was a little disappointed when I saw the trees.  Basically they look like someone cut tree limbs off a maple tree and put them into a pot.  Now, that may be how bonsai trees are made and I just don't know.  I thought that maybe these were mini trees that were grown from a seed and pruned and trained to be small.  But, as I said, I don't know much about bonsais.  I am also disappointed in that I read when making a forest one should really try not to put the trees in any order or try to make them symmetrical.  My forest is almost arranged in a perfect oval shape.  Also, the largest ""tree"" is very loose and feels like it may pop out of the soil any moment.  So, some of my trees look like a stick off a tree with maybe 10 small leaves on them and the top of the ""tree"" pruned diagonally.<br /><br />Now, am I planning on returning the product?  No, probably not unless it starts looking sick in the next two weeks or one of the trees falls out of the pot.  I think it is a cute bonsai and am hoping I can take really good care of it and get it to grow some more leaves and fill out.  To be honest, if I had seen this in a store for 100 dollars I would not have ever considered buying it.<br /><br />So I am giving it a four because it was shipped fast and packed really well.  It only lost about 10 leaves which I think is pretty good.  Some of the leaves are wilted but I am assuming it is because of them being in the dark box for a few days.  I also don't want to rate the tree too low because I really didn't know what to expect so I want to be fair to the product and company.  I also love the leaves that is does have.<br /><br />I took photos of it packed, me unpacking it, and the tree by itself.  I am hoping to post these photos on amazon.  I hope this helps you decide if you want one.  Like I said, it is small and cute but definitely not like the photo posted on amazon.  It is not thick with leaves or stems but this may be due to the season.  Oh, and my tallest tree is 13 inches from the soil to the top of the stick."

I spent 4 teenage years in Germany as a military child and I ate a lot of these while there, among lots of other haribo gummi products.

I was so pleased with it that I am not going back to my original brand.  You can either prepare it simply as directed on the box, or you could elaborate it a little by frying some diced onions in a pan at the beginning and adding a vegetable near the end.  We like adding mushrooms, but you could add almost any thing.  The fresh cilantro garnish at the end is a must.  It really gives the curry a wonderful flavor."

Personally, I prefer my Earl Grey to be somewhat more aggressive. The attractive packaging and the fact that the tea is organically grown by farmers who are fairly compensated are pluses.<br /><br />Incidentally, I tried this tea first with no sweetener; and it tastes fine ""straight""; however, because the bergamot is not strong, I found that I preferred it with a sweetener. Honey did not work for me with this tea; however, I found aspertame to work surprisingly well (Aspertame is usually one of my least favorite sweeteners).<br /><br />The brewing instructions are simple and work well.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the option of buying this tea in tea-bag form.<br /><br />To sum up, this tea is a quality product with good taste, from a good source, but otherwise unexceptional."

The vacuum sealing seemed far better this time when compared to the Boyer's ""Denver"" blend I tried a month earlier.<br /><br />A minor point - the bag is not as easily resealable as most bulk packaged coffees and you may want to store it in a container rather than trying to reseal the bag."

Whenever I really want crunch and Peanut butter this is what I go for. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because they do have too much fat in them.  If eatting both little bars they have 9 grams.  I tend to split it w/ someone or just eat it for breakfast!  Still it is organic and does have fiber and soooo much better than a candy bar!

I knew it was impossible to get that many half cup servings in a 13.5 ounce box.  So, I went on their site and found out the real nutritional info.  I won't list it all here, but there are six 3/4 cup servings in a box.  Each has 260 calories, 11 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber, 9 grams of sugar, and 7 grams of protein.<br />It is really delicious as everyone before me has said.  I've been using 1/4 cup of this with 1/4 cup of my other organic cereal, a yummy combo.<br />You certainly can't get a better price on this than on Amazon."

Add pieces of chicken, whole with bone, or boneless cubed into liquid to cover.  I then add whatever veggies I want from a frozen bag...  cauliflower, okra, peas, even a can of chickpeas works well.  Cover and cook until veggies are tender and chicken is cooked, 15-30 minutes.  Serve over rice.  I eat flour tortillas as a quick alternative to roti bread.  Just throw the tortilla on the gas stove burner, and flip every 5 seconds until blackened on the corners a bit."

08	3702,B00113XJQW,ATIFO1JHBA8BQ,10/29/08,5,5,5,Great Food!,I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!
08	24271,B001E0T29K,A3MILDAIBVX6WM,8/7/08,0,0,5,Eggcellent Product!,"This egg protein is great!<br />First off, it is sweetened with Stevia, a natural herb, and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose.<br />Next, it is very easy on the stomach, even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems.<br />It tastes good, mixes well, and is a good value.<br />I bought all 3 flavors and found I prefer the vanilla.<br />Goes really well with some almond milk and blueberries.<br />I'm glad I've found a pure protein source that is dairy and soy free."

I never notice when exactly it wears off. I never feel the jitters or have a racing heart. This product works wonderful. I do not ever want to be without it. Yippy Zippy  8>)"

If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican ""blends"" offered in stores and on the Internet).

But, as I've learned with most packaged food, it can be easily made into a 5.  I prepare as described on the box and top with mixed Italian herbs, crushed red pepper, and a pinch of shredded Parmesan.  Not only does it look more appetizing, but it tastes great!  And these are things I usually keep around the house, so I just grabbed whatever I had and it only adds about 30 seconds to the prep process.  I highly recommend if you're willing to add things you like to flavor it up."

I tried it for the first time a few months ago and I prefer to cook it in water, like oatmeal, maybe adding some raisins and sweetening with brown sugar.  You don't gobble it down as fast as oatmeal with its interesting lightly crunchy texture, yet it holds together like cooked oats.  Leaves you feeling more satisfied then common modern day cooked cereal.  I had a different brand which tasted ""too"" natural, like a weedy ""old"" corn taste, but this brand has a pleasant good tasting slightly-corn like flavor."

08	22575,B000CQ25QE,A1CWYS5FU8HHF8,5/8/08,1,1,5,great price for a wonderful product,Amazon has the best price around for this product.  It's Organic.  It's whole wheat.  It tastes great.  I like the fuller taste (and healthier characteristics) of the whole wheat.  Our daughter loves it and you don't have to feel guilty about giving it to her.  Throw in veggies or tuna or eat it plain - it's a good meal.

YUM! I keep it in the cupboard and am ready for friends and tea at a moment's notice. This is a rich sponge cake with currents and savory rich tones of brown sugar. The chocolate and sticky Toffee and Treacle are all good too - when you can get them.<br /><br />I know the name seems a bit naughty--it just adds to the fun of offering some cultural engagement to our wonderful world.

Yet in some areas Britain truly leads the world - where would we be without the sandwich, for example?<br /><br />Another area of British culinary pre-eminence is the steamed pudding, amongst which the Spotted Dick is king. As a pudding-fan, I am deeply saddened that several, rather puerile, reviewers find this name mildly amusing. I doubt they would stoop to such pathetic attempts at humour if they had bothered to taste it first.<br /><br />Take my word for it: nothing tastes better than a mouthful of dick, especially if it comes with a load of hot custard."

I found this treat very very sweet, and it has been a long long time since I have seen bread in a can. It tasted much better heating in the microwave and then pouring some cream or half and half on top.<br /><br />I give this out as a gift for Christmas and birthdays, and almost everyone loves it!!!

I use it on everything from egg rolls to prawns to chips.  And despite the fact that garlic is my favourite cooking ingredient, I've often come across dishes or condiments where the taste of garlic is too over powering (you can have to much of a good thing).

I always liked good vanilla teas, and some coconut teas always blew me away as well. Our pals at Steep Tea still make some of the best teas in around, so we were pretty game to try this Lana's tea - it always feels good to try out teas by the 'small guys'.<br /><br />Anyway, there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we couldn't pin down until one of our pals pointed out ""This smells like Bailey's!"" Bingo. Need I go on?"
08	15166,B0013E21V8,ATKLOMDBJL0QM,6/15/08,0,0,5,Very rich flavor...,goes well with pancakes or as a sweetener or flavor in baking.  We like Coombs as well.

They are not like eating a handful of sugar, but a real fruit taste-each color bear having their own fruity flavor. Always look for the Haribo name.  This is the orinal Gummi Bears, and the others a very poor immitations. Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
08	1257,B001FA1L7A,AX9RG05FWB6BD,3/13/08,11,12,5,Barb,Terrific with English Triffle.  Beware though the pack of 6; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding.
08	5154,B0031YJ38W,ANXSAKB16PK6E,12/2/08,0,0,5,Healthy Breakfast Lover,"Of the Erin Baker products, the Fruit & Nut Mini Breakfast Cookie is my favorite!  I have one mini breakfast cookie (about 100 calories) with a cup of coffee in the morning and I feel satisfied and ready to start the day.  Very healthy, low in caloreis, and super delicious is what makes the product work for me.  Try it, you'll like it."
08	44649,B001EQ55RW,A10ZBR6O8S8OCY,5/26/08,0,0,5,Pretty good nuts!,"The nuts taste fresh and have a hint of sweet dark chocolate.  There is more almond taste to it than dark chocolate, which is a great thing.  The chocolate flavor compliments the almonds well.  Great crunch, and has no after taste.  All the almonds are uniform in size and great as a snack anytime of the day.  Each canister is a generous size and is a great value for your money.  I highly recommend you give these almonds from Emerald a try."
08	38288,B007R1PGVS,AUMPZQU9481P5,10/22/08,4,4,5,Energetic but not jittery,"I've used this product for a couple of years and it's great!  You get increased energy and alertness, without any jitters, and it's all natural - not a bunch of chemicals.  I do not recommend this before a work out because you tend to use the bathroom a little more frequently."
08	57737,B000EVOSE4,AMISRMIJ0SYA,11/13/08,0,0,5,LUV Bears in Bulk!,I stumbled on this by accident and am oh-so-happy I did!  My faves are the pineapple flavor!

As a native of Argentina, I grew up with this stuff and no imitation comes close. Serve it inside crepes slightly warm folded and with powder sugar, with flan or ice cream and remember a little goes a long way. Very sweet!"
08	5160,B000WMPGDW,A1ZE815FVC6XJT,11/10/08,3,3,5,Heavenly!,"A friend brought me this from Argentina and my kids and I ate it with a spoon and then apples so that I would feel less guilty. When we finished, I immediately panicked because I wasn't sure if I could get it here in the U.S. Low and behold I found it on Amazon. It is different packaging but same company so I assume it is just catering to Americans. Delicious!"
08	22603,B00013EWNM,A22S7SHTK7UZ10,5/26/08,0,0,5,Great for parties,Thai Chili Roasted Garlic by Wild Tymes is the best. I take an 8oz block of cream cheese and spread about 3 tablespoons of the Thai Chili on top and serve with Triscuit crackers. It has been very popular at my home parties. Plus the cream cheese cuts down on the spicy heat.
08	22604,B00013EWNM,A1KJOB6JGS50RO,4/26/08,0,0,5,delicious and addictive!!!,"i ran across this over the winter and spread about 1/3 of it over a block of cream cheese and served it with crackers. guests ate it up and asked where i got it.<br /><br />i quickly ran out and inadvertently threw the jar away before jotting down the name. went back to where i got it (an emporium), and it was gone. just found it again, and i am ordering several to have for parties as well as to give as gifts.<br /><br />this stuff is fantastic!!!<br /><br />i, too, am not a fan of spicy, but when you serve it on cream cheese, it keeps it calm for the palate.<br /><br />highly recommended!!!"
08	56983,B0007W4VXI,A38Z5SBYT9F48N,12/17/08,3,5,3,Beware - these do not fit regular pod machines,"I own a Senseo coffee machine, and another brand machine which I keep at work.  Both use standard size coffee pods, quite successfully, and brew a rich cup of coffee.  I bought this espresso pod sampler and found that espresso pods do not conform to the size used by regular pod machines.  This is just a polite warning not to waste your money if your machine is not designed for espresso."
08	44650,B001EQ55RW,AHD7S5MILQ1MA,5/26/08,0,0,5,Amazingly Addictive!,"I'm in love with a jar of nuts. I'm hopelessly (but happily :)) addicted to these almonds. Heavenly. Adopted a healthy eating lifestyle since Jan 1 (and lost over 40lbs), after having sworn off chocolate and all things 'bad' that taste good, these nuts are an amazing treat!! Same nutritional profile as regular almonds, cocoa chocolately taste that isn't too sweet, and not too bitter. Perfection!"
08	38282,B007R1PGVS,A2CQA27WZ0AAQ6,5/7/08,9,9,5,good shot of non-jittery energy,"I like this stuff!  Good source of various vitamins (esp potassium) and it seems to give me energy without some of the adverse effects of other energy drinks.  Not a significantly high amount of caffine which I like.  Heck, this stuff might actually be good for you!  Taste is good, better than many other energy drinks and the price is good compared to anything you might buy in a can.  I prefer the orange flavor.  Probably good for hydration during hot sweaty work or sports events."
08	13603,B001E5E33A,AFOG8EFCCFYEM,5/24/08,1,1,5,Great taste,"I love Earl Grey Tea, but I can't always drink caffeinted tea. This really fits the bill. Same great flavor, but it doesn't keep me up all night. Nice addition to the K-cup selection. I used to purchase a similar item from Green Mountain Coffee, but they eliminated the product. So I really appreciate the ability to buy this from Amazon."

I found some 150,000 organic once in a specialty store that you had to be really careful with. This 90,000 will light you up and it tastes good. If you want some hot cayenne pepper get this."

08	71557,B001HYD6AY,A25LYZ5VL77N89,11/7/08,1,1,4,"great food, a bit expensive though","We have a labrador puppy, and we tried Iams puppy food when we first got her however, she lost interest in it after we stopped wetting her food at about 3 months old. I did some searching and asked for ideas from family, friends and co-workers and they all said Wellness brand is the best. So we found this food and it really is the best. The dog loves it, it is healthy food for her and really has helped her growing stage. She is now very healthy in her weight, joints, and muscles. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the price. While I think Amazon finds the cheapest price I have seen it up to $30 for a small bag and $60 for a large bag at a local pet supply chain, so it is a great food but shop around for prices. I have seen it for $25 and $50 at various online retailers, just watch that shipping. But overall a great food."
08	71556,B001HYD6AY,AA3DH8UCU63M2,8/18/08,2,2,4,Better than Iams,"I have a great pyrenees and he will eat this stuff like crazy. I tried Iams and he didn't like it, he ate the yellow bag of puppy wellness but he really likes the large breed formula. I would definetly recommend this to all dog owners!"
08	11476,B00015UC6G,A1Q53P73NRDW8I,9/29/08,13,13,5,Alternative Thickner!  Gluten-Free!,"This gluten-free starch  is used to thicken soups and gravies.  Its main advantage over other starch thickeners is that it's a permitted ingredient for Passover, unlike cornstarch and other grain-based foods. Liquids thickened with potato starch should never be boiled.  Supermarkets often stock it among the Kosher products. I have used this in cakes and in some gentle sauces.  There is no taste that comes from this so just the flavor of the ingredients comes through.  It is very silky and fine.  Remember you do not want to let your sauce boil with this starch.  Those who are on a gluten free diet may be able to use this."
08	57738,B000EVOSE4,A3GZZWBJX8L59O,10/12/08,0,0,5,These are the best,"These are the best Gummi Bears.  These are one of the few sweet treats I allow myself, but they are hard to find here.  I really like that I can order them in bulk and its cheaper than buying the little bags at the store.  I put them in baggies and have several months worth of treats."
08	71553,B000LKU20M,AT62HX1HHLLH8,4/25/08,7,8,5,Definately Not fine Ground.  But I've order it twice and will be back again.,"Everytime I run out of sea salt I am amazed at how hard it is to find just what I want.  Right price, right size, NO additives.  This stuff fits the bill.  Because the price is reasonable and the flavor is simple, I use it in everything from pasta water to baking.<br />BE WARNED - it is NOT FINE.  I put it in my spice grinder if I need a pinch of fine.  It is at least as coarse as the big blue box of coarse kosher salt if not larger and a bit more irregular.  That said, it doesn't stop this from being my favorite."
08	71552,B000LKU20M,A1G25CG7UWQ3XO,10/23/08,7,7,4,"Organic is good, fine ground is misleading","I ordered this Organic Fine Sea Salt because of the health benefits of trace minerals and have been very pleased using it for cooking. I don't know if the definition in New Zealand for fine is different than ours, but is very coarse. I like this product, but and rating it 4 only to insure you see the description is off. I will continue searching for a sea salt for table use."

I DID purchase a large quantity of Bird's custard power, the pack of six, but the packs have a longish shelf life, and I enjoyed sending a surprise pack/container to a friend who is originally from England.<br /><br />At Christmas, I will also include a container of Bird's custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product. For my non-English family and friends, I will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with Bird's custard recipe for trifle.<br /><br />English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Bird's custard powder, store-bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake. For the final touch, add non-dairy whipped ""creme."" Delicious and inexpensive! I highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through Amazon. And the price for the six  containers is so very reasonable as to almost be unreal. Go for it!"

08	679,B000G6MBX2,A1UJ6I72N22HT7,4/7/08,2,2,4,Very different flavor,"I love these chips. The flavor is not plain. They are sweet and spicy all at the same time.  The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. But, it still a great flavor!"
08	11488,B001EQ5D6U,AILHREBIGWLLE,4/18/08,12,14,2,Too Sweet,DONT BE FOOLED - This is not a Health Cereal.<br />The second ingredient is SUGAR and this cereal also has fructose in it.  I feel like I'm eating kid cereal.  It would be healthy if it had less sugar in it.  Carb-conscious people and diabetics BEWARE.
08	11489,B001EQ5D6U,AJQDIT55SZ3ZX,6/1/08,5,6,5,I bought 12 boxes~what does that tell you?,That says it all. This is the most wonderful way to get fiber. I use it as a snack as opposed to cookies or chips. I nver use milk just 1 cup in a bowl and a slowly munch one square at a time. It works for my weight watchers plan. A great way to get fiber and soothe the cookie monseter in a healthy fashion.
08	16476,B000F9XBDE,A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ,3/21/08,4,4,5,Delicious snack,These crackers are very delicious and better for your diet than flavored chips. The Parmesan & basil Wheat Thins are also fun and different. Be warned they are highly addictive!
08	16475,B000F9XBDE,A13C90XAUL1K81,3/23/08,4,4,5,Yummy,"I wasn't expecting much, having found a box of these for $2 at Big Lots , but they're actually quite tasty. Most of the boxes were pretty dented, so I suspect that's why they ended up at the close-outs store). I thought I'd have them all to myself, but it turns out all three picky eaters like them, too--probably due to the pizza like flavor with the crunchy cracker appeal that kids can't resist."
08	11490,B001EQ5D6U,A3DK2WSREDLS4Q,3/11/08,5,6,5,Like eating kid's cereal!,"This cereal is so tasty - it seems like you are eating one of those not-good-for-you sugary cereals that kids love. They are very similar to Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They do have a slight ""healthy"" taste, but it's hardly noticable. Even the kid's will enjoy this cereal which has an amazing amount of fiber in it - especially to taste so good (not like sticks)! I used to eat raisin bran b/c it had 7g of fiber and still tasted okay. Now I eat this, which has 9g of fiber and tastes awesome!<br />I highly recommend it. Oh, and the squares are small, about 1/2 the size of CTCrunch, so it's the perfect size for toddlers to pick up and eat. They'll think they are eating candy, but you'll know it's good for them ;)"
08	11491,B001EQ5D6U,AF4MPJS3CBKG7,7/18/08,2,2,3,Way too sweet for a cereal.....but great as high fiber snack!,"I frequently buy Post Shredded Wheat, and decided to try this new cereal because it's made of whole grain wheat.  My teenage children had the same opinion about Caramel Delight that I did...they liked it as an occasional high fiber snack, but it's way too sweet as a cereal!  General Mills should reduce the sugar, and instead increase the insoluble fiber in this cereal. That would make it perfect!"

08	11493,B001EQ5D6U,A3PM9DMVYG9HDK,9/17/08,1,1,4,A little too sweet but still delicious and great for GI health.,"I was a skeptic about this product until I tried it with skim milk. This cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after 5 minutes of being soaked in milk. I enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor. I think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb, but so far, I find this cereal to have the highest fiber content. The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day!"
08	11494,B001EQ5D6U,A2J5XULKP6YLCJ,9/6/08,1,1,5,AWESOME!!!,"Finally a High Fiber cereal that tastes great!! I like mixing the Carmel with either the Honey Cluster or the Raison Cluster for an even Higher Fiber load. And the lowest price I've found these cereals in on Amazon.com (we all love saving money while being healthy, right?). Try it for 3 days and I'm sure you'll love it like I do. Thanks and have a healthy day!!!<br />Mike Buckley<br />Concord, CA"
08	11495,B001EQ5D6U,A13K4OZKAAHOXS,8/7/08,1,1,3,My least favorite of the FiberONE options,"This cereal makes getting your fiber easier, but it does not taste as good as the other products in the same line. I was expecting ""Caramel Delight"" to have a powerful caramel flavor, but found it lacking. It's not that the cereal is inedible - it tastes fine, but the flavor gets a little lost once you add milk. It's like you're eating ""healthy"" cereal - the ""clusters"" options make it much easier to feel like you're indulging and taste much better. Just be warned - don't eat too much. Don't snack on it like it's popcorn. It's got fiber, even if you can't taste it - and your body will let you know when you've had too much."
08	11496,B001EQ5D6U,A2J6CSTJJIP0JD,5/23/08,1,1,5,The BEST fiber cereal I've ever eaten!,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cereal!  It tastes like a caramel version of cinnamon toast crunch.  All Fiber One products are great!  Not like other fiber products that taste like cardboard!  Get your daily fiber with a product that is actually delicious.  Highly recommend."

I've been eating this regularly since I bought it.  Everyone including my 3 year old loves it.  The best part, we are meeting our daily requirement for fiber.  I know because we're pretty regular now.  It's great to eat something that's good for you, and good too."

Treating corn flour with lime gives it a fairly distinct bitter aftertaste and a more dense construction.  Chocolate chip cookies made with masa harina, which tastes like the tortillas it's meant for? Little bitter bricks with chocolate chips.  eek.<br /><br />(I wish it were corn flour.  As of this writing, none of the major mills in the Americas--that means North and South--make gluten-free corn flour.  Not even Bob's Red Mill is, anymore, bless them for having the integrity to say so--although I hear you can order it from someplace in Canada.)<br /><br />*This is where we cut to the clueless Texas Roadrunner face.*<br /><br />This is masa harina, sorry guys."

It's a whole grain flavor but we are used to that.  This makes a good home made trail mix ingredient with Raisins, nuts, and a sprinkle of chocolate chips or M&M's of your choice.  Enjoy!"

I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through."

Really enjoyed having these in the house and they are a great buy - so affordable compared to most alternative diet foods. They'll last for at least a week or so and store well.
08	85690,B0000GIVA0,A7WV8N516BW2M,5/30/08,0,0,4,Tasty and Sweet,"This drink is sweet and sugary. The carbohydrate content (how much is sugar?) is listed as 27 grams. A serving size is 8oz. I used four to five tbsp to make a 12oz cup. I wouldn't recommend this for diabetics. You can used less, but it will taste watery. The drink is delicious though."

I've lived in India and, when having had access to a kitchen, have made my own from scratch using the same ingredients as in this tea bag (I added a little black pepper).  Twinings tea is a good substitute to scratch.  I make this tea in a 20-oz mug and let the bag steep for at five minutes (longer is better) to get the full flavor (I usually steep tea bags for only a minute or two).<br /><br />Unlike an earlier reviewer, I don't get any mint taste (the box ingredient list is:  tea, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and ginger).  I drink this tea with about 1/4 cup whole milk, 2 teaspoons xylitol, and 1 teaspoon of white stevia powder extract.  Yummy!<br /><br />I'd give this product five stars if it were organic."

I'd agree that you'd want to bake them for at LEAST 15 minutes (or test with a toothpick). You definitely will want to add something into the mix to give them flavor, otherwise they taste a bit like playdough."

We make orange cranberry muffins: I use orange juice in place of water and add a cup of dried cranberries (I do use an egg replacer in place of eggs), and cook them a bit longer than instructed.

Ever since the early 1990's I have looked for a replacement for my old standby, black cherry flavored Clearly Canadian that has long since disappeared.  This is by far the closest I have found and in the flavor department, this stuff is much better; no lack of cherry here.  The only wish I have is that it had a little more fizz.  While it is a little pricey here, the cost does include shipping, which is undoubtedly expensive for such a heavy and bulky item.  For those of us without a Trader Joe's around, this is a great way to get your hands on this wonderful drink."

08	13600,B001E5E33A,A23V7QUI3SFJTV,3/4/08,2,2,3,Good but oil of bergamot overrides black tea flavor,"Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings brand (sorry - their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit/perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless."

08	44651,B001EQ55RW,A3IL4WNBMGBJRY,5/26/08,0,0,4,Healthy chocolate snack.  Can it be?,"This is a great little snack for those chocolate lovers who want something healthy and a little bonus for their sweet tooth.  The almonds are just lightly coated with cocoa powder. So, it's not the same as having a creamy candy bar. But, you can snack on these for the same amount of calories you'd get with a handful of almonds instead of having a big old fat candy bar.  And, you get all the nutrition of nuts and their good fats with only 1 gram of saturated fat per serving.<br /><br />I'm a chocaholic and true chocaholics don't like their chocolate overly sweet.  These have a hint of a dark chocolate flavor and just a hint of sweetness.  The almonds are nice and crunchy since they are roasted.<br /><br />I gave these four stars out of five.  Some might miss the creaminess of a chocolate bar and these won't completely take the place a of a good piece of dark chocolate.  But,they are great to have around when you just need something to take the edge off of that chocolate craving."

And it's not just a ""quick"" fix either -- its therapeutic effects last for hours. I was a bit worried the tea would be a bit too ""licorice-y"" since one of its main ingredients is licorice root, but the fragrance and taste are mild and incredibly soothing. If you think this package of six boxes is too much, you'll be happily proven wrong ... I would stock my entire garage with this tea if I could!"

I can't keep straight which ones I like and which ones I don't like (very few).  It will also take me a while to go through all of them.<br /><br />If you have multiple espresso drinkers in your house, this one may be for you.  If you are the only one drinking it, I'd opt for the smaller blend sampler and keep things a little fresher.  Just my opinion.  All are of good quality.  No compliants at all."
08	44652,B001EQ55RW,A14JBDSWKPKTZA,5/26/08,0,0,4,Nuts About Nuts,"If you're a nut lover this may be just what you are looking for. After all, once you get beyond proper roasting, there isn't a whole lot you can say about nuts other than what you add to them. If you bury them in salt, or immerse them in chocolate, you are getting more flavor, but the trade off is unwanted cane sugar, and/or salt; so these make a pleasant bridge.<br />Extra added flavor with the thin coat of dark chocolate cocoa powder (that doesn't get on your fingers by the way), while only ingesting 25mg of sodium in a single 1/4 cup serving.<br />When I first started to eat them, I thought the dry unsweetened cocoa powder didn't add anything desirable to the flavor, but as I progressed to finishing about a 1/4 cups worth, I began to realize that this could very well become a strongly acquired taste.<br />If I had to be critical of the entire presentation, I would note that the plastic ""jar"" has a threaded top with 2 half circle single threads partially overlapping each other that results in a not so very snug closure. With very little effort you can snug them at closure and skip right past snug to loose again, so much so that if you dropped the container the lid may pop off, spilling the contents.<br />I am not commenting on the way they are sealed though, they did an outstanding job of that. You have to pop open the plastic seal over the top of the lid edge, just to remove the screw on top, and then once open, there is an internal air tight seal to keep the contents fresh, and they are. Overall highly recommended, especially if you are nuts about nuts."

No crappy pieces of tea leaves that some companies like to call loose leaf tea!<br />The killer tin is packed to the top with these sweet smelling leaves!  I hardly needed any tea to brew a sweet tasting & pleasantly aromatic cup!  I have a tendency to overbrew my tea & I probably let this brew for about 15 to 20 min. & it wasn't the least bit bitter! Very enjoyable!  Great with honey, better with honey and cream!  YUM! I have a feeling this tin is going to last me a long while!<br />I have one slight problem, it says it contains ""natural essential bergamont oil"".  Why isn't it organic????<br />Fortunately the tea itself is 100% Organic Fair Trade certified. Fair Trade means workers get paid a fair wage for their work/product instead of getting mere pennies a day.<br />Love your body & go organic whenever you can.  If you don't buy organic tea, you are ingesting A LOT of pesticides & chemicals in concentrated forms - brewing the chemicals right into your cup!  Yuck!"

Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here."

It's like bergamot overlaid with jasmine or some other unusual flower.  As a brewed tea it's all right but sniffing the dry tea was unpleasant.  I think we will stick with Republic of Tea or Yorkshire Gold.

(In order of preference: pepper, regular, barbecue, vinegar - haven't tried garlic.) The flavor reminds me of a baked potato, but spicy (not TOO hot). I can't get enough of them! The bonus is the low fat and calorie count, so I can munch without guilt - what a deal!"

As I've already reviewed on amazon, both of these flavors (as well as Revolution's Orange Chocolate Green tea) totally blow Lipton's Premium Tea Pyramids out of the water. The clear nylon tea bags that both brands use let you easily compare the quality difference -- whereas revolution uses long whole tea leaves, lipton uses little flakes and particles.  If you're willing to commit to 6 boxes of this tea you can buy it here on amazon for about half of what you'd pay on revolution tea's website!"

The cereal looks like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute.  It has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom.  The carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times.

As good as the Honey Clusters and Raisin Bran varieties are, this one may be the most fun to eat and will have you pouring yourself a bowl faster than you can run to the toilet (it is Fiber One, after all). The great thing is the taste, which is very reminiscent of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The squares in this cereal are dusted (seemingly) with cinnamon (or caramel as the flavor claims) sugar.

This is is an advantage if you don't want to have to wear clothing made in Indonesia, a highly laudable goal considering that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist.

It has a nice, herby taste and not over-licoricey at all (which I feared, not being a fan.) Really nice with a drop of honey.

These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says ""chicory root"" or ""inulin"" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.

I first bought two packages of the near the Tarharah, Mountains at a spring rally and have never been sorry.

I came across this spice rub in a gourmet food shop in Los Gatos, CA.  Hands down, the most flavorful and versatile spice 'rub' out there.<br /><br />Generously coating your fish with this mix adds a light crust and a slightly zingy, sweet flavor.  Additionally, the large amount of smoked paprika in the mix gives the food a wonderful red color.<br /><br />If you have guests that like a little more heat in their food without overpowering your fish, add a couple pinches of fine - not coarse! - ground pepper to the mix.  Your taste buds will thank you!<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this mix also works well on catfish, chilean sea bass, and orange roughy.  Of the Rub with Love mixes, this and their companion mix: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are by far the best."

The fresh, crisp almonds are beautifully complimented by their coating of cocoa.  They're lightly sweet, too.  Just enough to give you the full flavor of both chocolate and nut.  The only problem I have with them is that they're sweetened with sucralose, which is an artificial sweetener, and which may or may not be good for us.  There doesn't appear to be a great deal of it in the mix -- it's the last listed ingredient -- but for some it might be a problem.<br /><br />As with the Marcona almonds I tried earlier, these nuts have persuaded me to think of Emerald as a better brand than I originally thought.

After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!<br />We will definitely order these again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"

But Nestle celerac he loves it. I mix the cerelac with regular milk, not water.<br /><br />I use to drive about 30 miles away from my house to buy this cerelac. No stores around my area carried them, and I live in NYC (now one store carries it but only the rice one). I was so excited when I found them at Amazon last year. I immediately ordered a case of 4 cans with free super saver shipping (4 can package costed $25.71). This saved me time, $ from gas and mileage on my car; and its delivered to my doorstep. Thank you Amazon."
08	71389,B001E5E0HE,A3A90CELVLOUP6,6/24/08,6,6,5,Great portable cocktails!,"I used to buy daiquiris and margaritas already mixed in individual freezer bags and enjoyed the convenience very much. For some reason, I cannot find these anymore.  BTW: There are some made by Daily's, but they are made with wine, not liquour (but taste really good anyway!)<br /><br />Still, I was looking for my favorite cocktails in a portable bag. These were very good! They are very fruity (with real strawberry seeds) and creamy..not like kool aid. Also, they freeze really well, no big, sharp shards of ice, but with a squeeze or two, they were more like a slushy.<br /><br />To make: You open the twist cap, fill first with rum (to a premarked line), shake to mix, then fill the rest of the way with water and freeze.<br /><br />I made the first batch just this way, by pouring the liquor right in the bag up to the ""fill line"" on the packaging. I don't know if I had the bag set on the counter incorrectly or what, but the powder seemed to absorb the liquid and I ended up pouring too much rum in the bag and hadn't even reached the line! It didn't even freeze too well as it was too strong (we did drink them anyway!) With the second bag, I measured the rum in a measuring cup (1 1/2 cups...it is written on the bag, too.) They were better. You can vary the amount of liqour to your taste (or even use different kinds of alcohol...or I suppose none at all if you want.)<br /><br />One more fun tip: I mixed the entire bag, then poured individual servings into small ziploc freezer bags. I think I used about 5 or 6 little ziplocs per 1 Lt. Blender Bag (which makes 1/2 gallon.) Then I froze all the little bags. That way we could take only 1 when we wanted it, OR we could throw a few in our beach bags and they stayed slushy for hours. Plus, we didn't have to carry much garbage when we were done (like with cans or bottles.) Also, we didn't have to worry about doling out servings into cups or anything. Just slip a straw into a little opening in the zipper and enjoy!"

Only one grocery store in my area carries these chips and they are frequently out of stock, even at $3 a bag. Worse, even when in stock, I am lucky to find more than a few bags at a time in the store. I hate making the special trip just for the chips, particularly when I often find the shelf empty.

My daughter is a huge fan of it and is so glad that we can grab it and go.  It's a nutritious snack that satisfies all the tastebuds.  Some of us have even tried the slightly spicy brand.

I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you."

I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent.

There's not enough cocoa in these almonds to provide much in the way of antioxidant power.  Eat them simply because they're good, although they are a good source of Vitamin E and potassium.<br /><br />On the down side, these almonds are sweetened with sucrolose (Splenda), so if you're staying away from artificial sweeteners, avoid these almonds.

I immediately went on a search for the product and finally found it in the gourmet section of a local grocery.  Then, I found it on Amazon... and a LOT less expensive!  BREATHE DEEP tea has not only helped me with my respiratory issues (asthma, bronchitis, chronic sinus congestion, etc.), I've shared it with family members and friends who are also amazed at what one cup of BREATHE DEEP tea can do.

The first few bites actually come across a little strongly, with the ""roasted"" taste definitely the first thing you'll notice.  However, the cocoa taste, while more subtle, soon overtakes the initial burst and it's almost as though you've got a small candy bar in your mouth.  My eldest daughter wasn't sure at first if she actually liked them, but once she ate a few, she quickly took off with the rest of the jar.

Best, that is, until the other day, when we received samples -- through the Amazon Vine program -- of two new nuts from Emerald: Cocoa Roast Almonds and Marcona Almonds.  I like the Marconas, which taste kind of like Macadamias, but don't have the almost soapy texture that has rendered them inedible to me since childhood.

The soda pop flavors are good. My only complaint is the beans arrived all mixed up... is this the shipper's fault - I don't know.<br /><br />So when I saw the flavors scattered across the bins instead of being in each individual compartment I groaned. I even attempted to sort the beans - but gave up after 20 minutes. However, my wife who is much more patient than me spent over an hour to sort the beans and came up with every flavor in the correct compartment except for Jalopeno and Green Apple - which have the same coloring.

A few common threads emerged.<br /><br />1. Chocolate doesn't come off on your hands: Very convenient as there is almost no residue left on hands even after holding a handful of nuts for a minute.<br /><br />2. Very subtle chocolate flavor: For some this is a plus and for some this is a negative. You know the chocolate is there, but in my opinion it just leave you wanting more chocolate. I couldn't eat more than 10 or so for that reason. They were just plain frustrating. This was the consensus of 4 out of the 5 taste testers. The fifth loved them and plans on finishing off my canister and probably ordering more. They are definitely not milk chocolately, but have barely discernible, subtle dark chocolate undertones.<br /><br />3. Dry: We all needed to drink water immediately after tasting the nuts as they dried our mouths out, much more than normal salted or roasted almost or any other nut for that matter. Three of us described them as tasting ""burnt"" or ""too roasted"".<br /><br />4. We keep eating them: Even though I'm not crazy about these nuts -  in fact only one of us was - we keep coming back for more about every hour or so. I get frustrated every time I do, either wanting a chocolate bar or just some plain old chocolate. Perhaps this is a good trait in a snack, that you can't keep eating them ad nauseum.<br /><br />Other observations<br />The 11 oz ergonomically comfortable container is about 8 inches tall and fits perfectly in your hand or in the cup holder of the car. The lid is screw-on rather than flip-top. The package contains 11 servings of 150 calories apiece (120 calories from fat), 13 grams of fat, six grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. Very much the same as other nut products.<br /><br />The conclusion? If you aren't sure already that you love these nuts, buying a four-pack might be too much for you. But if you love them, you love them, as evidenced by our one taste tester and many of the other reviews. I'd recommend trying a smaller volume before ordering in bulk here."

The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!"

But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12."

All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.

The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon."

If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling.

I highly recommend both the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate varieties.  They are very smooth and rich, and not the least bit ""waxy"" tasting like some of the more popular American chocolates.  Each individually packaged bite is the perfect size for an adult and maybe a little more than a mouthful for a young child. Each tiny package contains a special treat- a tiny insect card which features a color photograph and interesting facts.  If you have a budding entomologist on your hands, these are the perfect treat!

Look for the certification by environmental watch-dogs like the Rainforest Alliance and keep up the demand for Arabica (uh-RA-bih-kuh) or Rainforest Blend coffee; just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee house.<br /><br />GoGreenMart&More voted Yuban as a Product of the Week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and protects the environment as well."

Also, all of the flavors are delicious-- i usually don't like eating cherry or lemon flavored candies because they tend to taste very artificial, but in the case with Haribo brand gummies, it feels like all of the flavors taste great, and it's hard for me to choose a ""favorite.""<br /><br />The reason i decided to buy this 5 pound bag is because I realized halfway through the school year that i've been buying at least one or two bags of the bears at the school bookstore per week, and decided that it would be a better buy to buy the candy in bulk."

They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more."

At first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore. In addition it is not available anywhere in town and, before we found it here, we had to go to a Sam's club 50+ miles away to stock up on it. apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find. The company also makes a ""Club"" mix, as opposed to the ""Pub"" mix. I made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued ire from our clientele.

And I was quite shocked. I guess I need at least a little more sweet. But I'm shocked because I'm not THAT much of a sweet tooth. It's the bitter after-taste that really bothers me with this product. I really couldn't take it.<br />So just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond. Think again!

The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."

But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.
08	67795,B000G6MBUA,AUHS7PQNAHNDI,7/4/08,0,0,5,Yum,Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.

I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.

They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."

It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."
08	67803,B000G6MBUA,A1B05INWIDZ74O,6/2/08,0,0,5,These will be habit forming!,"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat."

The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked!

While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you."

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."

When I go the local farmer's market, I always look for the nut stand so I can buy some kind of cinnamon, honey, jalape&ntilde;o, or whatever-flavor strikes me.<br /><br />When I was offered a chance to try the cocoa almonds, I was pretty thrilled.<br /><br />These nuts just ""okay"".  They're not spectacular.  As another reviewer noted, they aren't very chocolately.  If you have a chocolate craving, this will just make it worse.  They're also very dry (as are most almonds) and you'll need something to wash down every handful.<br /><br />The almonds are high-quality, and it's a good cocoa taste, but don't expect to be blown away by this.  It just won't happen.<br /><br />The container is probably what impressed me the most.  It's sturdy, resuable, handy to hold, and the screw-top keeps the product fresh.<br /><br />If you're looking for almonds with a subtle cocoa (not milk chocolate) hint then this is for you.  But have a drink handy."

Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"

The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon."

They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open.

I had been purchasing the Planter's ""energy"" mix but they were out of stock so I thought I'd give these a try.  They are fresh and delicious with whole nuts - the walnut pieces are very large (two bites at least).  The mix seems to be mostly almonds and walnuts, which is fine with me because those are good nuts for you.  Unlike the Blue Diamond smoked almonds, these nuts aren't overly salty, which is a plus for me!  On the downside, the little sticky paper that they include to ""reseal"" the package (after opening) doesn't work very well - I ended up putting the nuts into a container to keep them fresh because the package wouldn't stay closed after I opened it."

I've purchase the EXACT same thing at Walmart for $1.99/package (which comes out to $0.67 per packet).

I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them.

I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.

08	67988,B001E95KQA,A1UC6I9XIPPZLJ,11/30/08,4,4,5,Delicious mountain jasmine green tea,"Organic Spring Jasmine is a nice light to medium tea with a calming scent of jasmine coming from the cup. The jasmine part isn't overwhelming like other blends can be, but it's more like a delicate floral aroma behind the main taste of the China green tea in the bag. The green tea itself tastes fairly delicate yet still green, without being very vegetal or fishy, like some greens can be. The ingredients are of high quality, and it has a medium to heavy body, or ""mouth"" feel, for a tea. Combined, the flower & tea work in perfect tandem; when sipping the cup you first get the floral of jasmine, then you get the beautiful flavor of green tea. So yummy! I would call it a perfect pairing.<br /><br />When I serve this to anybody, they immediately say ""Oooh I LIKE this!"" (or some iteration of that), and then ask from where do I get the tea. Then, they either start the same scouring high and low for the tea that I once did, or they plain out ask me to buy some for them because they can't stop thinking about it once they've had it.<br /><br />Note: Mighty Leaf teas are the best bagged teas; they have quality handcrafted silk-like tea pouches that let the leaves (yes, LEAVES) inside fully steep & expand without adding any additional ""bag"" flavor, as some paper bags do. This creates an exceptional cup of tea for the individual. They just scream ""quality"". Once you see one of the bags, you will probably want to get some for yourself, too. I'd say Mighty Leaf teas would make great gifts for tea lovers.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon, Organic Spring Jasmine is now a staple in my home - through the subscribe & save, you can get a 3-pack for around $15 at the time of this writing, which is quite a deal considering the quality of tea you get for a comparable price to supermarket brands. I hope they continue to supply it forever since I now drink it every day."

I love it, plain and simple.  It makes me happy. The whole house smells better. I believe it's good for me.  We drink it hot and also as iced tea. What else is there?  Well, in a more perfect world, I'd also like it optioned as Decaffeinated too so I could drink it into the night.  I conquer this by brewing half of Green Tea Mango with a Decaf black tea bag and tell myself that there's surely less caffeine in green tea anyway, but heck, I'm not a scientist, I don't know that for sure.  But your taste buds will dance and trust me, you will start carrying these bags to restaurants rather than settling for some hum-drum tea you're offered.  It actually brings a smile to my face.  How else can I say this?  It's amazing even for a coffee drinker like me to find a tea that I'll root for like this one.  The fact that I now keep it stockpiled is my little secret.  But I don't want to ever be without it again.  Now that's some cup of tea...."

The dominant notes in this mix are cumin, coriander, and chile.  This isn't a hot mix per se - if you want to kick things up a notch, I'd recommend adding a dash of cayenne - but it is excellent.  Only the two standout mixes that Chef Tom sells: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are better.<br /><br />This is best on baby back ribs, lamb chops, and pork roast.  I only remove a star because the mix isn't that versatile: it's not particularly suited for spicing up soup, chicken, or fish."

I've always enjoyed rich, bold dark roasts and this is the best I've ever found.  It has a slightly smoky taste and is very intense, but it doesn't taste burnt or sour, like a lot of dark roasted coffees.<br /><br />Also, if you're ever in Seattle, find one of their shops and try an Appassionato Mocha, made with Dilletante Chocolate's Ephemere dark chocolate sauce.  Absolutely to die for!  Unlike most mochas, this isn't overly sweet and neither flavor overpowers the other, they complement and enhance each other perfectly.  The feel of the drink in your mouth isn't gritty or cloyingly syrupy, but smooth and substantial.  The cup has the lovely smell of lush, sensuous, dark chocolate and freshly roasted coffee.  A real treat for all of the senses.  I love my coffee and Appassionato is the best, bar none."

Ever since I lost 180 pounds on the Atkins low-carb diet in 2004 eating healthy low-carb foods like almonds, I've been looking for ways to enhance my menus with something a little new while still keeping my carbs reduced.  These nuts from Emerald certainly do the trick with a unique twist:  DARK CHOCOLATE!<br /><br />When I first saw these, I thought they were coffee beans.  But upon closer examination, you realize these are almonds that have been dusted with dark chocolate cocoa and Splenda.  That's right, NO SUGAR has been put in these bad boys.  It's the best of both worlds--healthy AND tastes good!  I'm adding these to my regular ""must buy"" list when I go shopping because you never want to be without these when you need a great-tasting snack.  ENJOY!"

I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor.

I also added some to a smoothie, with positive results.<br /><br />Almonds are a good health food. Chocolate is the 9th wonder of the world, as far as I'm concerned.

08	38105,B00142IAKU,A3R1D7H3PIFONU,12/30/08,5,7,5,Incredible soda!,"Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The melon flavor reviewed here has a very unique taste. Think honeydew more than watermelon, sweet and light with that distinctive Ramune lemon-lime backbone flavor holding everything together. Truly a treat.<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink."

There is no fiber to speak of and they are loaded with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I use them when my blood sugar drops too low much as I would a piece of candy.

Likewise, both the fillings and the crusts are sickeningly sweet and almost overpower the fact that the idea is that the bar is supposed to taste like ""real"" fruit.  Any variety of Wal-Mart's Great Value brand of cereal bars trumps these in a heartbeat.  GV's crust is more dense the sweetness is subtle, allowing pleasant fruitiness to filter though.  I highly recommend those."

This product is a tasty way to do that. The cocoa dust on them gives a sweet dark chocolate taste to the almonds without the fat of dipping them in chocolate. Cocoa is good for you, too, reportedly having similar benefits to drinking a glass of red wine every day. The two together here are a real treat that you can feel good about eating. The canister they're in is a good size for sharing or portioning them out over time because it's reclosable. My family loved them and I know we'll be buying these regularly."

It reminded me a little of eating a high quality fudge with lots of nuts in it.<br /><br />But the nice surprise was that the cocoa taste lingered in my mouth so that I continued to enjoy the flavor long after the almonds were eaten.

Since learning to cook a few Thai dishes at home, I've been in search of rice noodles that taste like what I can get from my local Thai restaurants, and these are exactly what I wanted. Their flavor is fantastic. I can't really quantify exactly what it is about them vs. others that I've tried, but they just taste better, period.<br /><br />If you're looking for an authentic Thai noodle that works for Pad-Thai, or stir frying, you can't go wrong with these."
08	44678,B001EQ55RW,A3D9BTRM4JOU41,5/21/08,0,0,4,A tasty snack,"These almonds make a good snack. The cocoa coating isn't sweet -- in fact, it's vaguely bitter -- and it isn't overpowering. The nuts themselves were good and fresh. My wife and I both liked them.<br /><br />On the other hand, my daughter said ""I don't hate them, but I don't love them either."" Save these for the adults -- they'd work well with red wine or sweet cocktails."

08	44679,B001EQ55RW,A2F1QPIJTDWK55,5/21/08,0,0,3,Very tasty almond treat!,"If you like chocolate that isn't too sweet, you'll be delighted by this lightly dusted cocoa almond snack. This is the type of snack you can't eat just one of, and would be perfect to serve at a dinner party too, as it is quite elegant."
08	19241,B001E5E20O,A1AEPMPA12GUJ7,10/22/08,0,0,4,Smooth and fragrant,"I guess the tin isn't totally airtight, since I could smell the tea and bergamot that adds up to Earl Grey. The cup of tea was even more fragrant, smooth and not bitter. Since it is loose tea, you need a tea strainer or tea ball, but since it is a small tin, you can pack it on a trip. I like it with milk, but others add lemon. Either way, it's what Earl Grey tea is supposed to taste like."
08	19240,B001E5E20O,A1KSDKIZ4XN3GG,10/22/08,0,0,5,Delicious,"As soon as I picked up the container, I was sure I would be in for a treat.  It's so well made, not a cheap-feeling tin full of dusty tea.  The excellent quality of this tea was apparent even before filling the teapot: long lustrous leaves with a heavenly aroma.  Use much less tea than the instructions on the package call for: since this tea is very flavorful it does not take much to brew a good cup.  The characteristic Earl Grey flavor is exactly balanced with the strength of the tea flavor.  Recommended without hesitation."

I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you."
08	5232,B0009OMU00,A2VELL4FFV92RO,6/25/08,4,7,1,Contains MSG,"The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor."

I have tried the variety case and absolutely love all the flavors.  Instead of chips and dip, I now have popchips plain or with fat-free dip or salsa and still loose weight eating something that I truly enjoy!!!  Popchips are the best tasting 120 calorie snack on the market.  It truly does replace your craving for salty, high fat potato chips, doritos, fritos, etc.  You may be amazed when you try these popchips!!"

A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!"

I will continue to use this product as my pets become adults. There is also dry product, and treats, and more in this brand, as well as maintain your pets weight products. Most highly recommend."

They are not greasy, have a very satisfying crunch and although they are formed chips, they taste like actual potato chips. Only one grocery store in my area carries these chips and they are frequently out of stock, even at $3 a bag. Worse, even when in stock, I am lucky to find more than a few bags at a time in the store. I hate making the special trip just for the chips, particularly when I often find the shelf empty. Problem solved -- Amazon's are much more reasonably priced and I can stock up -- and this snack is as close in flavor to actual potato chips that I've found to date."
08	49370,B000IHNCQO,A1GP5IFDJ4PUG6,12/21/08,2,2,2,Too Salty Too Bad,I was hopeful for a crunchy low carb snack and gave these a try. These were okay but too salty for me. I doubt I will re-order.
08	49369,B000IHNCQO,A2Y8IDC1FKGNJC,12/24/08,2,2,2,will not re-order,"I was expecting something better than what arrived. The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state."

08	38064,B000ZE9NM2,A2FY6QW813NZCR,2/19/08,12,14,5,Amazing Groumet Touch,"Okay, you probably don't really need these finishing salts.  But the flavors are amazing and it really does add a nice touch when you're trying to impress your dinner guests.  I really don't cook with salt but adding little sprinkle of black or red salt adds crunch and color that can really make a dish pop."
08	68122,B00016R1MI,ASJHJDGRATQ20,4/7/08,0,0,5,What more do you want?,"The taste isn't great, but you can get used to it (I mix mine in water).  I am a vegan and I don't like eating a lot of soy (I think it may upset my stomach).  This product has 0 grams of sugar and only 4 grams of carbohydrates and is very low in fat, so you cannot expect it to taste DELICIOUS. There is 22 grams of protein per serving from non-soy vegetable sources, so 3 shakes a day for a work out routine plus snacks in between is a routine worth trying."
08	68132,B003EM7J9Q,A1J52MX2YDWSU0,10/15/08,2,3,2,Thought it was a good idea,"I am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first.  But like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth.  And they are very salty.  I only cooked them for 90 seconds, the bag was still expanding when I stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done (they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness I didn't do that).  Nice idea but I don't think I will buy these again."
08	55299,B008Z4VAPM,A2H43DXUXC2CU1,9/2/08,0,0,4,"easy to make, a bit salty","This is good for a powdered product. I prefer the separate soybean paste with a packet of dried seaweed & tofu, but this has a good flavor. A bit salty for my taste."
08	31153,B007M83302,A26YLEA768A9KE,11/22/08,1,2,5,Unbelievable snack,"I ordered these as a suggestion from the Hungry Girl Website, my husband and I Love them.  No nasty after taste, delicious and still healthy."
08	44680,B001EQ55RW,AIAS4YFLHJWW6,5/21/08,0,0,5,Sooooo yummy!,"I wasn't entirely sure what I would be getting when I ordered these, but I'm glad I did. There's just the right balance of salty and sweet -- the chocolate flavoring is perfect.  Plus, the container is great for stowing in a desk drawer or even in the car for an on-the-go treat."
08	9803,B000KFXEYE,A2YM8BKEP0TBOT,2/26/08,0,0,4,Good Amaretto Flavor,"I tried this unknown manufacturer ""Stephen's"" and was pleasantly surprised. It had a good amaretto flavor along with the chocolate. The aroma is good. I use it in my coffee for a homemade mocha taste."
08	482,B000G6RYNE,AUHS7PQNAHNDI,7/4/08,0,0,5,Yum,Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.

I have thought about calling the Better Business Bureau and complaining. It's a matter of principle!  It is a good mix, but I won't be ordering from them again."
08	38049,B000R7XBF2,A2KPUN6GES29VH,9/18/08,2,3,3,customer service saved this one,"My family is nuts about these chips. We had a problem with shipment, as many of the sacks had the air squished out of them and were stale. I contacted customer service and they are going to make it right. We live 50 miles from the nearest store, so we are grateful for the convenience of free shipping. With three boys scattered all over the place, I appreciate the handy single-serve sacks. That way, they don't sit down and eat an entire large bag."
08	70990,B000MVTNQE,A387FFR9R1V0D,6/3/08,2,2,4,A different taste,"I have been a long time fan of Olbas oil.  It is indispensable during allergy and colds seasons and helpful on plane flights too. So I had to try the tea.  The good news: it doesn't taste like the Olbas pastilles.  The bad news: because it is instant tea, the herbs have been processed with sugar and transformed into little granules.  That was a surprise and I would have preferred something without sugar.  That said, it is a pleasant drink and soothing when one has a stuffy nose."
08	44681,B001EQ55RW,A1N5FSCYN4796F,5/21/08,0,0,4,Two Great Tastes Come Together In A Healthy Snack,"The front of the label for these almonds from Emerald mentions two things that I am fond of:  almonds and dark chocolate.  I went in with hopes that combining two good things together would result in something better than the two separately.  In this case the result is pretty good.  While this is only mentioned on the product page (and not the actual container itself), the lid doubles as a measuring cup for a single serving.  After having these over the last few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />While I like the taste (a lot!), it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  When I think of dark chocolate, I'm expecting a taste similar to a piece of Dove Dark Chocolate miniatures.  It is a taste that is rich with a very mild sweetness.  The coating on these almonds is a little bit sweeter than that.  It's nowhere near milk chocolate, but like I said it wasn't exactly what I expected.  That said these are still really good.  The almonds themselves are great with only a minute amount of salt.  With the chocolate and the natural flavor of almonds this is a sweet treat.<br /><br />Who It's For:  Disciplined people looking for a sweet, but healthy snack.<br /><br />Suggested Use:  A single serving makes a great between meals snack.  If your stomach starts to rumble around 10 a.m., this will bridge the gap to lunch.  I have the canister in a desk drawer at work.  Regardless of when/where/how you use them as snack, discipline and moderation are key.<br /><br />Potential Improvements:  The one thing that bugs me on these is that the 11 oz package does not divide evenly into 1.5 oz servings.  It would seem like a 12 oz canister would have been easy enough.<br /><br />Overall:  This is a great tasting, healthy snack to enjoy in moderation."

These are the $0.99 size bag of chips you can buy at Walmart or a convenience store.  This is great for my family since I am not a big chip eater, but, my 8 year old son loves chips with a hot dog or a sandwich.  Now, I don't have to worry about a ""big"" bag of chips going stale before they are eaten, or having to buy chips every time I go to the grocery store!  They are great for school snacks and family picnics, too.  When the grandchildren or my son's freinds come over, they love them.  They can grab a bag and go outside to munch and play!  Good thing I ordered the 60 count box of Funyons, also!!!"

We picked up Zuke's and can't get over how crazy she is for them.<br />They have great natural ingredients, including Vitamins, Omegas and Flax. No artificial colors, flavors or by products.

I have gotten Spelt flour from Arrowhead mills before and it was great...totally fine.  But I think with something like millet flour, that maybe not as many people use, they must just package up what they have left on the shelf.  Now I know that even though it is a little more expensive at my local health food store, it is worth it because it isn't old and expired!  YUCK!"

Dust and roast the almonds in chocolate powder so you get the light taste of chocolate, without a heavy candy-coating of chocolate full of calories and sugar.  These almonds are crunchy, non-salted, and not too sweet with a hint of dark chocolate taste.  Only 1 gram of sugar per serving, with 3 g of dietary fiber.  So it meets the South Beach diet criteria.  6% Calcium, 8% Iron and 35% Vitamin E.  My family loved them and these disappeared too quickly."

But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this."

(In order of preference: pepper, regular, barbecue, vinegar - haven't tried garlic.) The flavor reminds me of a baked potato, but spicy (not TOO hot). I can't get enough of them! The bonus is the low fat and calorie count, so I can munch without guilt - what a deal!"

Not too much, not too little, every recipe falls within my personal taste parameters, as well as everyone I know who has tried 'em, for that matter.  The ratio of carbs to protein, the low sodium, etc., makes this a VERY attractive snack to me because I'm diabetic.  It's why I'm compelled to write a review. It's REALLY hard satisfying some of the cravings a diabetic gets. We LOVE our carbs, but it's SO hard finding low-carb snacks that give the same satisfaction as, say, a loaf of bread, or crunchy sweets, etc. The Grandpa Po line literally saves my a** because too often I ""cheat"" on stuff that drives up my blood glucose, and that is VERY bad. So, a handful of this stuff LITERALLY is a benefit to my health. Fellow diabetics, TAKE NOTE!"

However, if you are craving a snack: crunchy, salty, buttery satisfaction, minus the preservatives and unhealthy ingredients of normal snack foods, Grandpa Po's is the way to go!  It is the closest you'll get to guilt free snacking that wasn't found in the fruit/veg aisle in the supermarket.  4 simple ingredients make this crunchy popcorn soybean snack extremely satisfying and ""not-so-naughty"" when compared to the million other snack foods out there, not to mention the many unpronounceable ""mystery"" ingredients included in them - not the things you want to put in your body.  For my destination wedding, I brought a few cases of Nutra Nuts to put in my guests' welcome bags.  Well, no one even mentioned all the other local gourmet treats that were in the bags -the Grandpa Po's were the hit!  Everyone was walking around w/ their Grandpa Po's Originals pouch in hand: ""these things are GREAT!""  Clever packaging allows you to reseal and keep them fresh for the next urge to snack - although usually not necessary for this customer!"

Grandpa Po's is the perfect snack to take on the road.  Not too salty or sweet, they  satisfy that need to nosh without feeling gross. I even feel fortified!  Plus they come in this nifty zip-lock bag that keeps them fresh even if I leave them in my car for a couple of days.  I never want to be caught in traffic without them!"

08	57753,B000EVOSE4,A1BL6UUS8EJ4W0,5/26/08,0,0,5,Tasty,"Well I like gummi's and wanted to try these, they were very good. The quanity and price are perfect. I have since ordered more."
08	48842,B000EHP62G,AIBRTGBN07D6A,5/5/08,57,58,5,Taste great,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein.  First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious.  They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal.  Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein.  Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).  While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein.  The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well.  Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.<br /><br />Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried.  As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either.  Below is the main nutritional info:<br /><br />Calories  180<br />Total Fat  5g<br />  Sat fat  2g<br />Sodium  250mg<br />Carbs  30g<br />  FIBER  6g<br />PROTEIN  9g"

I still love the tea, and it's hard to find in grocery stores.  So rather than return it, I'll just limit drinking it to AM hours."
08	36851,B000EEWZDM,A1HNMJJ6D2RL8G,2/23/08,11,11,3,bennyclams on clams!,I use canned clams because I no longer live in the northeast. I use them for linguine with clam sauce. I found Crown Prince chopped clams more like minced than chopped. Also they were packed in water rather than clam juice. I had to add bottled clam juice to make it better. Overall they were adequate but I have returned to Snows chopped clams packed in clam juice.
08	57754,B000EVOSE4,A2OEPPOBT9EWK5,5/25/08,0,0,5,Absolutely the Best Gummi Bears,"Delicious!!  These are cost effective and perfect for when I have a sweet tooth.  I travel a lot so I put a handful of these in a ziplock bag and throw it in my briefcase.  Perfect for a snack now and then.<br /><br />If you buy these at the airport at the nut stand - you'll literally get a handful for $10 no joke.  This way, you'll get 5 pounds for that price.<br /><br />Also, these bears are very good - the best ones I've ever had.  They're not soft and squishy but harder yet chewy.  Very good!"
08	31187,B007M83302,AXXWXM6K66YMZ,10/17/08,5,10,1,Too strong IMO,"I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here."
08	70931,B0018N2UNI,A34F9NN2U8QBY4,8/7/08,4,4,5,The name says it all!,"I LOVE this tea!  My first introduction was a gift from one of my former students, and I am absolutely hooked on it.  This tea is good with anything, but especially with Middle Eastern, African, or Indian foods.  The unique flavors of mint are enhanced by tarragon...which is not as strange as it sounds!"
08	44683,B001EQ55RW,AQCS89BWQDFSQ,5/21/08,0,0,5,"Chocolate coated almonds, but not in the normal way...","Most ""chocolate covered"" nuts tend to be a nut with a full coating of chocolate wrapped around it, that can be even slipped off and eaten separately ot licked off, etc.<br />Not so with these Cocoa Roast almonds -- what we have here are full sized almonds with their skin still on given a slight bit of dark chocolate powder over them as flavor.<br />And it works fantastically. Another review mentioned that they may not be sweet enough for soda drinkers, but I disagree. They are nuts, they aren't candy. They are easy to suck the flavor off, or just eat normally. And while the skin is still on them, they don't make a mess like normal almonds do -- perhaps it's the cocoa coating or perhaps they are just processed a certain way.<br />Not only do they taste wonderful, but the added flavor doesn't mean less healthy.<br />Really, a four and a half star product. While it's a fantastically unique taste, the packaging has a really SILLY warning that it ""CONTAINS ALMONDS"" right under the ingredients list. And $6 a cannister means it's not something everyone can just buy many of and have whenever they want."
08	28498,B0016FRI8A,A1ONZ8JRPLBNUI,8/3/08,1,4,2,mona lisa,This was a big disappointment. There was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. The color is green and not very appealing to look at. However it does work as a great antioxidant.
08	48843,B000EHP62G,A1P9MNOH8DUIGC,1/5/08,10,10,5,Tastier and less caloric than other breakfast bars of its size,"I've never been a fan of ""energy bars"" or ""breakfast bars,"" but I'm hooked on Kashi GoLean Crunchy caramel bars. I eat one every day for breakfast and often have another after dinner in place of dessert.<br /><br />While other breakfast bars are either too small to satify you until lunch or too caloric/sugary to justify their status as a ""health food,"" GoLean Crunchy caramel bars are substantial at 45 grams apiece and truly low-cal at 150 calories.<br /><br />Best of all, these bars do not taste like chemicals but, rather, like a healthy (high-fiber, high-protein) version of a chocolate-dipped rice krispie treat.  All GoLean Crunchy flavors are excellent, but the Peanut Butter and Almond versions pack a few more calories (180 and 170, respectively) than their caramel cousin.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by other breakfast bars that can't offer *both* good taste and low calories (there are plenty of ""healthy"" breakfast bars that run upwards of 300 calories each). GoLean bars are the real deal -- great-tasting and healthy."

08	31196,B007M83302,A2PL7D70ZQ22LU,6/22/08,0,2,4,Great chips,"I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through."
08	84446,B000ETAJZ8,A12ENBT314RFXR,9/1/08,0,0,5,Animal Crackers Sure To Please.,"These cookies are a wonderful replacement for any kid ( or grown up ) wanting to eat a long time favorite. There is about 80 cookies per bag, so it makes it well worth the money spent. They are light, buttery and crispy making them great for milk. These pack well in bags for lunch  ( don't break up easily ) so they would do great in a kid's lunch for school or daycare. I actually give these cookies to people to show them gluten free doesn't mean cardboard."
08	36860,B000E1HUXK,A2BDLERUINF6HN,12/18/08,4,4,5,the best by far,"after my daughter was born she was put on the similac advantage. she did okay for a week and then had violent gas pains. we swithed to the lactose free of the same brand and she was ok for a week and then the same problem again. then we switched to similac isomil soy and she was better but was getting horribly constipated. finally, we switched to goodstart soy and she is a different baby. she NEVER has any gas pains and poops regularly and easily, this is the best formula by far!"
08	36862,B000E1HUXK,ADLYO655RWJUI,12/18/08,5,6,3,Did better than the orange can.,"My daughter was put on the orange goodstart at birth.  But after going through several long nights, and her screaming bloody murder before she'd potty (she went two days without going potty), her doctor switched over to this formula.  She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can. She's only been on it for 24 hours and has already started showing gas signs and has been spitting up all evening. Not sure if she just needs time to adjust or what. I know with the blue soy she seemed to have been doing much much better.<br />Only thing I dont like about the soy formula is the greasy residue it leaves in the bottles. You have to let them soak in hot water in order to clean them properly."
08	48849,B000EHP62G,A2KVOFZ61MPA3Q,1/16/08,2,2,4,better than most others,"For me, most energy bars don't taste good enough to eat except when I'm starved and nothing else is conveniently available. These are much better than most others, because they have a pronounced peanut smell and flavor. I also like that they contain a lot of fiber. The only thing that keeps me from rating them the full 5 stars is that the chocolate flavor is minimal. Still, I'll definitely buy these again."
08	5235,B0012YEKCW,A23PF0J8IKZHKI,12/22/08,70,74,5,Good Stuff,"This is good stuff.  However, I planted it, and no cats grew up.  Just grass."

08	68232,B003EM7J9Q,A294XIDCE087BB,4/6/08,31,33,5,Wonderful if you can handle salt,"I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you."
08	68233,B003EM7J9Q,A39FP3XLBS5WDA,2/27/08,28,31,5,"Yummy, fresh pork rinds!","I love it, less than two minutes in the microwave and you have hot, crispy and fresh (key here...some of the already puffed ones in stores are stale) chicharrones, or pork rinds.  I found these on a health food site and couldn't believe it, so I ordered a box.  They are really yummy and as long as you don't overindulge, you should enjoy them every time you are seeking something crunchy and salty (and low in carbs!)."

08	68235,B003EM7J9Q,A377IGU7KZH80L,4/18/08,14,15,4,Great snack,"These are an interesting and tasty alternative to microwave popcorn, well worth trying. The spicy version is not very spicy, but has a little kick. Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming ""diet food."" They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack."

08	70885,B000E4ALGK,A1U2IE9A4Q1YH,12/8/08,0,0,5,Not Just for the Kids,"These rice bars are so tasty.  They aren't too sweet and it makes me feel good that my child is enjoying a healthy snack.  Sadly, I enjoy them as much, maybe more, than my son does.  They're great to nibble for a midday snack or if you want to throw them in your bag for a snack on the go.  The bars are like a peanut butter flavored rice krispies treat, but with way better ingredients.  They sell smaller boxes in the supermarket so you can always try them out before getting this bigger box.  The value in the pack of 6 is there if you really enjoy the bars.<br />Don't judge me.

I enjoyed the product as did my Toddler. The nuts are dry w/ a dusting of chocolate that isn't too sweet to the taste.<br /><br />It's good that it gives only hint of the chocolate. I wouldn't say it is addictive as some of the other flavors like the standard smoked seasoned ones, but it is enjoyable. The coating is pretty dry and doesn't come off on your fingers either, so eating it w/ your fingers is pretty mess free."

If you are Coke or Pepsi drinker, then they may not be sweet enough for you. I am not, hence I and my entire family enjoyed their subtle chocolaty flavor.<br /><br />- The nutritional content is not bad at all, except artificial flavoring, which I would never notice on my taste buds if it was not written.<br /><br />All-in-all -- absolutely delicious and filling snack!"

And I particularly love this flavor--yes, I am a peanut butter fan.  I like that they are light and very much like a rice krispy bar.  I find them a good afternoon snack (I also love Clif bars, but sometimes I want something lighter, and quicker, to eat).  I wonder if the folks who don't like them (if they aren't a competitor) are used to more mainstream foods that overwhelm the taste buds with sugar and artificial flavors.  In any event, maybe you should buy a box before you buy a case... ;-)"

08	70837,B000CQ4D3C,A3TITSY7GWXV6H,2/27/08,0,0,5,very quick,I love Annie's mac and cheese. It is made with real cheese that is great; great with some tuna to add a bit of protein.
08	70836,B000CQ4D3C,A36Z74IY9G1PU0,5/1/08,0,0,5,Delicious,We got this because the white cheddar was out of stock and I have to say it is just as good or better than the white cheddar.  Our 4 yr old loves it.  It tastes a lot like Kraft - only better.
08	70835,B000CQ4D3C,A1BWO7IMU1E3JI,5/29/08,0,0,4,Quick & easy,"Makes a good lunch, especially with the addition of a bit of milk and butter."
08	70834,B000CQ4D3C,AKMEY1BSHSDG7,7/11/08,0,0,5,I added a slight touch of olive oil for texture and flavor.,"This is an instant meal in a box to take to work with you or have for dinner with a little added leftover chicken or tuna to make it a little more solid! (What the heck, you can toss in some veggies as well.)<br /><br />As strange as it may seem, I started occasionally using this for breakfast when I discovered I had run out of instant oatmeal. I was in quite a hurry, but I was starving, and the rest, as they say, is history! It's a very good breakfast on the run, and its great for kids, as well. I doubt the company would market it as such, but if it's good in the evening, it should be just as good in the morning!<br /><br />Yum!"
08	70833,B000CQ4D3C,A39Z97950MCTQE,9/8/08,0,0,3,"Easy, Could Use More Flavor","I actually prefer the taste of the Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese, which is not instant, but has more flavor. The kids are eating this, though, which is a good sign. It is effortless with convenient packaging."

08	70826,B000CQ4D3C,A1P3Z1ROTZSX4,4/26/08,3,3,5,yummy,The trick to preventing boil over is to put it in a big bowl - I add a little milk and butter for my daughter's because she' skinny and picky. I've also started tossing in a heaping tablespoon of pumpkin puree and she eats it like it's chocolate cake. Real easy and this is a reasonable price -
08	70824,B0007SNZHU,A110GSSPW2XWZJ,5/1/08,1,2,4,Good flavor,"Although I prefer regular grits, this product really comes in handy when I am in a hurry.  The flavor is really good.  Would take a lot of work to duplicate the flavor using plain grits."
08	9833,B001EQ5CK2,A2JXAQ92WYPAAR,6/15/08,0,2,4,"So Far, So Good","I liked everything about the transaction, although I am sure that I ordered ground but I received whole bean. I especially liked the price and the speed of delivery."
08	57758,B000EVOSE4,A36GYBL61NAYVA,4/29/08,0,0,5,Best gummi bears ever...,"Gummi bears don't get better than this! If you've never tried them before, they can seem quite hard at first, but I think this gives them a nice texture that doesn't melt in your hand or your mouth. You can chew them and the flavor lasts and you don't end up eating as many. A great fat-free, though high sugar and calorie, candy that will last forever in the 5-pound sized bag. I recommend immediately transferring them into a gallon-sized Ziploc (or other brand) freezer bag so that they stay fresh. If they are exposed to air for a prolonged period of time, they will become even tougher and eventually impossible to chew! Enjoy the best gummi bears ever!"
08	80228,B000J2JKGO,A33YBKXF13A81D,8/26/08,0,2,1,"New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good","This has given my young dog persistent loose stools. My older dog also had problems with loose stools on the adult formula, which was immediately rectified by a change to Innova. See the large number of serious complaints on the web about the new formulation before buying."
08	57759,B000EVOSE4,AAIF1CFVZR13R,4/13/08,0,0,5,Great Value,This is exactly like the Gummi Bears you get in the store but at an extremely good price.
08	36904,B000H7CURW,AULRBZMQ5OMAM,11/29/08,0,0,4,"IF YOU REALLY, REALLY like it hot!","Really yummy, Not that hot to me, but the fumes drive other people from the room, so I guess I'm not an accurate judge.  I love being able to buy this by the case so I can keep it in stock.  Not salty enough for me, but easy to add a couple of shakes.  Also a bit dry for me, but I just add a squirt of Pam.  This will leave fumes in the micro for DAYS.  A small price to pay!!!"
08	70815,B000E4ALGU,A3P6E109ZGN3DY,7/13/08,2,4,3,These Are *NOT* Soy-Free,"FYI, for those of you on the GFCF diet, these aren't soy-free (if you are watching soy too).<br /><br />They're yummy though!<br /><br />Tori<br />http://gfcfblog.blogspot.com"
08	70814,B000E4ALGU,ACOVASRSHX864,3/31/08,9,14,1,HAS SOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I purchased this item the ingredients on amazon did NOT say that it was made with soy oil.  My son is alergic to wheat, milk, soy, peanut and eggs.  I was so happy when I found this because it was affordable and (I thought) he could actually eat it.  When it came I was really upset to find that it's made with soy, not canola like it states.  Amazon should fix the discription.  I ended up bringing the bars into my classroom and giving them away."
08	70805,B000E4ALGU,A17T2660XVV21Y,4/27/08,0,0,5,"adults like them, too","Although they are obviously marketed to kids, my husband and I keep these around all the time. We take them with us when we go hiking for a quick snack (he prefers the peanut butter). Also, they are only 2 points on Weight Watchers so they fit in our diets and I prefer them to treats with artifical sweetners and loads of chemicals. I try to stick with organic as much as possible so appreciate that aspect, too. They don't have much fiber, but I consider them a treat so it's ok. For more fiber, I recommend LaraBars and ReBars. They are both excellent products, but not as much of a ""sweet treat"" as Envirokidz bars."
08	70804,B000E4ALGU,A1VPZWJG4YYCT1,6/30/08,0,0,5,great for brown bag lunch,"My son loves these.  Easy, gluten free item to put in his lunch bag"
08	70803,B000E4ALGU,A3ATG9WZ6L1EU8,10/24/08,0,0,5,My daughter loves these!,My daughter eats one of these bars almost every day.  She had to go gluten-free last year and this was the first treat we found that she really liked.  She takes them to school for her snack and doesn't care that the other kids are getting things like animal or graham crackers.  I like them because they are healthy and portable.  I keep one in the car and one in my purse for emergencies.
08	80226,B000J2JKGO,A15E280KEOD4VL,3/17/08,0,1,5,Canidae rocks,My Weimeraner loves Canidae dry food.  It's healthy for her and leaves her always wanting more.  Highly recommend it and it's worth the cost.
08	80225,B000J2JKGO,A1S2GUIPPNHBJW,12/9/08,5,9,1,Beware new formula!,"Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible."
08	2895,B000F9Z1WI,A3DOPYDOS49I3T,4/5/08,2,2,4,These are ok.....,These are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo. I purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy. In my opinion these tasted like animal crackers. I will stick to chips ahoy 100 calorie packs.
08	2894,B000F9Z1WI,A2YB7DLC3FOR7W,4/15/08,2,2,5,Very good snack!,"I really like these.  They are so light and airy, almost like chips instead of cookies!  The flavor is that yummy OREO chocolate we all know and love!"
08	28488,B0016FRI8A,A24NRU0P0TN907,5/23/08,1,2,1,Terrible,This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.
08	36909,B000H7CURW,AWAB7PKBO3BBT,12/17/08,0,1,5,HOLY ***** this is hot,"Finally a spicy popcorn that is super hotttt!!!  This popcorn definitely lives up to the Dave's Insanity brand.  It is hot, but also very addicting.  Everyone I gave to popcorn to came back huffing and puffing for one more handful.  One peculiar thing was that I ended up leaving half a bowl unfinished, and when I came back to eat it the next day, it was not stale.  Bizarre, but tasty."
08	68340,B003EM7J9Q,A38P1V6DBEXIXE,11/12/08,6,7,5,"great product, bad design","The product itself is great, it's the bag that needs work.  I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty."
08	48876,B000EHP62G,AJYYC02OCVT0P,9/8/08,1,2,5,Sweet Satisfaction,I love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter and these Protein and Fiber bars by Kashi allow me to enjoy them both sans guilt. The complex blend of grains used helps one digest slowly and keeps one satisfied for a long time.  It's portable and doesn't lose its shape or form when thrown into one's purse or diaper bag. They also help with regularity. I would recommend this to anyone who is active.
08	68355,B003EM7J9Q,A127N629MFMXKN,7/9/08,4,9,1,They taste soooo bad!!!!  Gross!!!,"I got these for my dad from his wish list.  He thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell.  The box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag, it's impossible to even want to put yourself through that again.  They are nasty!!!  Avoid them at all cost!!  Yuck!!"

08	44687,B001EQ55RW,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,5/20/08,0,0,4,"a tasty, not too sweet snack","If you are looking for a nutty snack that is not too sweet, this might be for you.  My husband and I both tried them.  He thinks this is more of a 5 star item.  He liked the fresh nuts with just a bit of a cocoa taste, and though I liked them, I would say they are maybe in the three star category, because I was hoping for something slightly sweeter.  We both liked that the coating was not a ""come off in your hand"" kind of variety that makes you look for something to wipe your hands on.<br /><br />We both enjoyed them though I don't know that I would purchase them for myself again.  Nothing wrong with them, just not sweet enough for me.  I would however purchase for my husband.<br /><br />As with any nut product, they are high in fiber and the good kind of fat, but you don't want to dip into too many if you are dieting as they run 150 calories for 1/4 cup, so portion accordingly."
08	68358,B003EM7J9Q,A30YA7KLPBG6CI,2/14/08,3,10,2,Not For Me,"In all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product.  I purchased it based upon his suggestion.  Unfortunately, the smell (oil I am assuming) of it cooking made me feel ill.  Even though the product cooked perfectly, the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day."
08	70784,B000E4ALGU,A35CY9IQ56K5D1,1/22/08,1,1,5,A favorite even before we went gluten free,"My kids LOVE these bars, they have been a favorite for about a year.  We just found out our son is gluten intolerant, this is one of the few foods from 'before' he gets to keep eating.  Great for on the go or school lunches, they help him not feel so left out as all the other kids gobble down their gluten-containing granola bars."
08	70783,B000E4ALGU,A3LRZDHCJFKGHU,2/24/08,1,1,5,Move over Rice Krispy Treats!,These are great on the go or for a late afternoon snack.  It also eliminates the work of melting marshmallows and mixing with cereal yourself.  Kids love them too!
08	48878,B000EHP62G,A1G53RDB335737,8/24/08,1,2,5,Like a healthy snicker's bar!,"These are really good.  I reach for them when I'm craving a snicker's bar, but these are of course a much better choice."
08	44688,B001EQ55RW,AU4H7OG5UFDWO,5/20/08,0,0,5,sinfully great taste,WOW! I can't believe that these chocolaty almonds contain no more calories than plain almonds. They taste sinfully delicious. The perfect balance of nutty flavor and chocolate. Very satisfying!!!

These are old concepts that have never been fully executed: Most bars on the market lack one of these crucial elements. Surprisingly, Kashi hits a home run with the ""Go Lean"" crunchy, chocolate peanut bar. Highly recommended!"
08	13552,B000LQLV6U,A9E9L159FFMHP,8/2/08,4,4,3,These are ok.,"Crunchy.  Came packaged well.  If you are thinking they are going to be like FunYuns, you would be wrong.  They are VERY mild flavored.  They are ok, but nothing I would crave for sure."
08	28484,B0016FRI8A,A1CBNUBPZPWH5D,7/17/08,3,5,4,Refreshing summer beverage,"I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasn't certain if I'd like it but I've read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.  This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isn't too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery."
08	48880,B000EHP62G,A2ERU6D7Y9MPLA,7/7/08,1,2,5,Kashi Junkies,My husband and I made the decision a few months ago to stop feeding our kids crap....after all you are what you eat! The difference in our lives is AMAZING. Not only do we see the weight benifits of it our childrens behaviour changes are amazing. After taste testing alot of different breakfast products we found and fell in love with Kashi. Finally something healthy that doesn't taste like cardboard...WWOOOHHOOO! Even my kids love these bars. Thay are great with a fruit smoothy in the morning for a quick on the go breakfast or a quick afternoon snack. I do have to say I can get a case of 24 at Sam's club for $18.84 so they are a little cheaper their. I encourage you to try all their products...we have yet to try one we don't like.
08	28483,B0016FRI8A,AHVF60N50361W,8/25/08,0,0,5,Tea,"I liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea.  I use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge.  Very good COLD and needs NO sweetening as is lightly sweet already.  Doesn't look pretty, but DOES look like a healthy drink!  I liked it!"
08	48881,B000EHP62G,AB39SPGO6B4KO,6/12/08,1,2,2,Kashi cereals are great - the snack bar is only fair,I really like the Kashi cereals and thought I'd try their snack bars.  Not so good.  Doesn't have the magic the cereal does.  Maybe its too sweet.

Not only food for white trash, they are low carb and make the perfect snack food. The aroma from the microwave during the cooking process is heavenly. Be sure to shake the bag per package direction. A must for the pork rind addict. After you try these, you will never go back to prepackaged rinds."
08	68376,B003EM7J9Q,A1FXMKXVJED66L,12/25/08,2,2,5,DELICIOUS FOR THOSE TASTE BUDS,IF YOUR A PORK RIND LOVER THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT FOR THOSE WONDERFUL TASTE BUDS. THEY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH BEFORE THEY GO DOWN. MMM MMM GOOD.
08	68377,B003EM7J9Q,A2NRKNW644Z7F4,12/16/08,2,2,4,pork rinds,This is a great product. You do have to play around with the cooking time for your microwave or you can easily overcook. The product was delivered quickly and in great condition.
08	48882,B000EHP62G,AK8E25W8KIDOO,5/22/08,1,2,5,I love these,I love these bars and buy them all the time.<br /><br />But I just noticed that Amazon no longer has nutrition information easily available.<br /><br />What is up with that ?
08	11970,B000ETGBOQ,A1AJ51DXDP14CE,1/27/08,3,3,4,Love the flavor and crunch,Great flavor and love the snap!  When your looking for something crunchy that isn't high in calories (a litle high in carbs though) these are amazing and you can have 17 crackers in a serving.  I was buying them at an natural health food store for $2.79 a package.  A much better deal for a case here on Amazon (about 1.00 less per package)
08	48883,B000EHP62G,A3U1HORLOVR2JY,2/22/08,1,2,5,Thanks Kashi!,"Outstanding taste for a healthy snack bar.  I buy a number of Kashi products, they have never disappointed me.  This has got to be one of their best, it is hard to believe it is good for you!"

08	68398,B003EM7J9Q,A1MLXVVVLBPF7L,11/16/08,1,1,5,Yummmmm!,"Just got these and tried them over the weekend.  They were easy to cook and taste great.  My husband saw that I had them and tried them as well, so now I'm glad they come 15 to a box.  These will be a staple on our snack shelf.  There is a big differance between store bought and these.  These are sooo much fresher (and tastier).  They also fit very well into my high protein/low-carb diet.  It's wonderful to snack on something with a crunch to it!"
08	68399,B003EM7J9Q,A29ON7DBR7NMO2,11/15/08,1,1,5,my nightly snack,NO CARBS  This is my favorite snack -  very light and crunchy.  Not as dry as the packaged pork rinds.  I love these -  Been getting these for 6 years and still order them every 2-3 months.

Well they discontinued carring them and I was BUMMED OUT beyond belief. I LOVE THESE THINGS. I done a search on line and found then on amazon.com and you can't imagine how happy I was. I bought 2 cases of them. My whole family is addicted to them. Did i mention I LOVE THESE THINGS. They go into my microwave for 1 minute and 20 seconds and you have hot fresh pork rinds. They are so much better than the pork rinds in the bag on the potato chip isle. 2 Thumbs Up"

Only problem I have is that both are a little on the Salty side.  2 Minutes in the Microwave and you have cracklin pork rinds.

I thought I'd try these because they are something different from the usual chips & cookies.  They were a huge hit.  Ten packages were gone the first day and everybody was walking around with a smile on their face spreading the word. I will definitely be ordering more!

Now I found them on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.<br /> It's a quick, easily prepared snack, and as other reviewers have pointed out, not bad for your diet.<br /> Once they come put of the microwave, open the bag, pour them out, and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl. I may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again"

Those are gross!<br /><br />We purchased 25 pounds (5 bags)of these HARIBO Gummi Bears and when that was all gone, we purchased another two.<br /><br />Great for favors, for snacks, and parties!  Even great if you just love Gummi Bears!"

Especially since it is lower in fat content than regualar mayonnaise and even low fat mayo made here in the USA.<br />Tastes terrific, with a little tang, is lighter than mayo and pours easily from the container. Certainly makes a healthier, tastier ,and refreshing alternative to regular mayo. Highly recommend this and will buy this again especially at this lower price offered by Amazon. Some other on line sources have one bottle listed at way over $5.50!!"

I dont know why I have asked them I never got a satisfactory answer,and they have never made it for sale in the USA. the only way I can get it, is to order it through Amazon or the local English shops here who sell English items of food that have to be imported.  It is not expensive in England but quite expensive over here. I think Heinz is missing a good bet not producing it here."

They ate so much I planted yet another pot.<br />Having the grass around deters our cats from gnawing on strange things, like plastic, especially when they are having digestive problems."

My local grocery store was clearing it out (much to my benefit). Once I experienced it, I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out, I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again, they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping. What an amazing deal. Thanks to everyone at Two Leaves and a Bud and Amazon for their insight to carry such a great product.<br /><br />Bt the way... This is ""Whole Leaf Green Tea"" and the tea bags are adorable sachets versus the paper type you get with everyone else. Top drawer stuff. You actually savor every last drop."

I have been enjoying gummi bears for fifty years with the first being in Germany when I was a child. Through the years I have tucked some in a plastic bag while going to meetings, traveling, etc..  I have even been willing to share with people I like!  Haribo makes the best on the market today. Best flavor and texture by far.  I have a war with my self daily to not simply gobble up a handful of gummi bears as I pass through the kitchen.  Sometimes I resist and sometimes I don't.  I just keep my fingers crossed that Haribo will keep selling them just as they are now."
08	2375,B00196U7OI,A1E7G56OX03JKO,5/9/08,6,9,4,Chewy and Satisfying,"Whole grain ingredients and good tasting.  Most Kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains, but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix. It's nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth!  There are several varieties of Kashi cookies, and they are all good."

Plus it is Quick and easy and wonderful added to homemade soups and stew.  I like adding veggies and cheddar overall if I serve it as a side dish.  Everything Lundberg is wonderful ... esp. their rice pasta noodles.  yum."
08	2373,B00196U7OI,A601IGAG8FWGW,7/5/08,5,5,5,Just Great,"I was looking for some nutritious snacks - with fiber - and came across these.  I've tried this variety and the oatmeal/flax ones and both are very good. They have a dryish texture but are full of flavor.  Wouldn't say they're like home baked, but there is no ""artificial"" taste at all. They're generous in size (3-4 inches diameter, almost an inch high) and though not calorie lightweights (120-140 each depending on the variety), they have 3-4 grams of fiber each. Highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast."

Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can."

I have been regularly buying these since I first saw them in a Penny Markt shop in Frankfurt Germany.<br />They are crunchy, salted snack, which can be added to soup if u like. But I use them for a substitute in an Indian dish - ""Boondi raita"" where u add this to beaten salted yogurt before serving with Indian breads or rice.<br />Not just that, but my whole family likes to munch on it generally. Back means baked in german, so I sure hope its baked, that makes it healthy"

I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one."
08	68461,B000QSMZ22,A2211XUAO701D7,1/8/08,1,1,3,Didn't work for my dogs,"All my dogs reacted badly to this food.  They seemed to like the taste but it gave them diarrhea.  I gave it a while but saw no improvement.  However, they are now on Castor & Pollux's Organix, and I've never had such a great experience with a food.  The ingredients are high quality and their stool is now perfect every time - much easier pick-up for me!  So Castor has good products, just this one didn't work for me.  Every dog is different though, so yours may have a different experience."

We each have different favorites and we do slow down in eating them by the end of the case, but we like em all and are happy with the price.  Besides being a bit healthier, we actually like them better than most of what we find in the local grocery stores.  Packaging was good and shipping was fast."

08	48898,B000EHP62G,AIBRTGBN07D6A,9/11/08,0,1,5,"Fairly good tastye, although not as good as the chocolate","I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein. First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.<br /><br />Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried. As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either.

Most people like that it is tasty, but not incredibly bad for you. Although for a family of 4, buying 72 bags of this stuff would be a little too much of the same thing. Overall, a real crowd pleaser!"

The chocolate isn't too sweet nor too bitter. It is also not too creamy or milky. As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too. Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust)."

If your ever in Germany, visit an ALDI or PLUS supermarket and purchase these Haribos at 300g for 85 cents EUROs. And if your in Bonn, Germany go to the Haribo plant where it all started!!!

Out of desperation I searched the web and found it at Amazon.  Who knew?? If you like jam and want to dazzle friends with a fresh jar of homemade--this is your best bet.  No cooking.  No fuss.  EASY.  And always works.<br />I have literally made gallons of jam using MCP pectin."
08	42085,B000G00ONC,AIBEAP93X3EHQ,8/8/08,1,1,5,YUM!,This is one of our family's favorites.  We eat gluten-free and it's hard to find such instant products on a restricted diet.  We love the flavor.  It's a nice break from rice and potatoes.

The orange zest flavor is incredibly strong and it has oddly crunchy rice-like bits in it that aren't great.  I'm sure that there are probably fans of this recipe out there, but I wouldn't order it again."

08	70643,B000FNB3AI,A330BAWQRJG0RE,10/22/08,0,0,5,Nana's Ginger Cookies Rock!! Go Nana!!,"These cookies are soooo delicious!  Due to Celiac Disease and other gluten intolerances, three members out of our family of five must be gluten free.  These cookies sure fit the bill for a treat!  They are delicious, and even though they crumble a bit (if you eat gluten free you would probably be used to this since rice flour is commonly used, and it crumbles), they still have a soft moisture to them.  The ginger flavor is really good and not any spicier than a ginger snap.  My two boys ages 9 and 11 LOVE them.  When I pull the cookies out of the grocery bag, they dance around with joy!  The true test was when my husband tried one.  He does not have to eat gluten free, nor does he care to, lol.  He really liked it, and has since requested them when I shop! A+++ for these!!  Thanks Nana!"

08	70641,B000FNB3AI,A20C8RWT4WGMYB,11/15/08,0,0,5,They taste yummy to me!,"I have Celiac Disease, which means no gluten.  Gluten comes from basically every grain except for Rice and Corn.  So for those of us who like ""real food,"" we can't have it.  Nana's Cookies are Wonderful!  All of the flavors...  It's so nice to have a gluten free food...especially a sweet cake like cookie...that doesn't taste like dog food...but like a ""real"" chocolate cookie."

08	44689,B001EQ55RW,A3CWEK9HY2VPDL,5/20/08,0,0,4,"Not sweet enough the first time, but it got better","I like almonds, and I loooove chocolate!  Even dark chocolate.  The problem is that putting the two together doesn't create an especially healthy or low-calorie snack.  But these almonds aren't dipped in melted chocolate, they are dusted with a dark chocolate cocoa powder.  In theory, that sounds like the best of both worlds...<br /><br />... but to me, it tasted kinda like they were covered in dirt.  Well, maybe not dirt, but not exactly sweetness either.  And that may not quite satisfy those of us with a BIG sweet tooth.  But after subsequent servings I grew to like them much more.  I passed some around the office and the reception was much more positive than my initial taste test (of course, it might have just been because it was free food...).  And once I decided to share them with the kids all I had left was an empty container.<br /><br />So, as I sniff the pleasant aroma of roasted almonds and dark chocolate from an empty container, I must admit it makes a good snack for the office, although 4 stars is a bit generous.  Even a small serving is mostly satisfying and low-calorie enough that I don't have to feel guilty.  My biggest complaint, however, is with the lid.  It just won't screw on tight.  Every time I tighten it, the threads slip and it's loose again.  Maybe the next container will be better..."
08	44690,B001EQ55RW,AHGGSY182427,5/20/08,0,0,3,I was surprised.,"I really thought I would love these.  I like all kinds of nuts, roasted and otherwise.  I like all kinds of chocolate, really like dark chocolate.  Heck, I even love mocha roast coffees and dark beers described as nutty. But I don't love this product.  Maybe it's just me.  I understand it's not cocoa in the sense of a creamy coating, but rather it's a dry dusting that is not unhealthy.  I understand it's dark cocoa.  But I didn't like the taste.  I will end up mixing these in with other trail mixtures.<br /><br />If you havn't tried them, I'd maybe find a way to get a nibble somewhere before buying a four pack.  You might love em.  Or like me, you might be surprised."

The Emerald product line was started by the company in 2003 to market their products to a more upscale consumer segment, where Emerald trades on the particular hipster, dinner-party image that their products sometime bring to mind.<br /><br />Emerald roasted almonds come packaged in durable 11-ounce canisters with screw-on tops to help keep the product fresh (and, it should be noted, indented sides so that one's hands can easily grasp the container even if one has previously imbibed a few cocktails). Sampling the contents, I was not disappointed; I found the almonds to be as flavorful and addictive as they can be. Interestingly, Emerald also chose to provide a variety of flavoring options such as dark chocolate to help keep things interesting for us. Bravo!<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you like almonds, buying the Emerald product should be an easy decision for you to make. Highly recommended!"

08	9860,B000KJRF40,ABCH3V9O9QEPF,12/29/08,2,2,4,Great Gift,I often order this product to give to others.  This is a GREAT gift!  Everyone to whom I have gioven this product as a present really enjoys it.  This is more special becuase anyone can give chocolate.  This is different and cannot be purchased at regular stores in many states.

Not too sweet, it is a beautiful, creamy, delectable and exquisite experience in chocolate tasting! My guess is that Heaven will be paved with Cote d'Or milk chocolate.  The dark is excellent too!"

And there is really nothing else.<br />The second primary ingredient is chicken meal. That's the only source of protein and it's not even real chicken.<br />Just because it's organic doesn't mean it's good for your dog. Organic low-quality ingredients is still low quality."

The chocolate is not sweet at all (they also have no other flavor to them), which means I can only eat about three before I feel like their getting bitter.  It may be that their just too dark for me and they will not be too strong for someone else.  they would probably be good in a trail mix of some kind to give your taste buds some flavor variety."

08	44693,B001EQ55RW,A3EX36SNRYD5VL,5/20/08,0,0,4,Not as good as other Emerald nuts,"I'm not a huge almond fan but I can like them.  I am a huge dark chocolate fan so when I saw this product I thought ""Great"".  One serving is approximately 25-27 almonds I measured and contains little ""bad fat"" and lots of protein and fiber for the amount.  The cocoa appears to be baked on and not merely sprinkled or the nuts rolled in it because it clings really well to the product.  The almonds are nice and big, well roasted, and taste just like you'd expect from an almond.  There in lay my greatest complaint: the cocoa wasn't very noticeable.  Was it dark cocoa?  Maybe but because the taste was subtle it was a bit difficult for me to tell.  In a world where we need to be eating healthier I know that we might have to change how we eat chocolate but unless almonds are one of your favorite nuts, try one of the many other brands of cocoa-covered or yogurt-covered varieties all in easy to open and reseal containers.  So far, the cocoa-dusted walnuts are my favorite."

I must also go extremely light on dairy & any sugars, if I want to avoid severe illness.<br /><br />This cookie is a wonderful solution. It is tasty and chewy, just sweet enough, but it causes no negative symptoms for me. The fat content is from canola oil, which is so much healthier than the usual fat or shortening sources, even in 'healthy' cookies. It also gives me a sense of having had something from the 'bread' food group; but without the negative physical consequences.<br /><br />I am delighted to have found this cookie, & I highly recommend it!"

It is also exactly as spicy as most of us know and love about any ginger baked good.  Nana's does a beautiful job of making, packaging, and preserving (naturally) their product.  If you tend to shy away from pre-packaged cookies, trust me, this one will not disappoint!"

He went on a healthy diet, lost 21 pounds and ALL of his numbers came down to normal range. He wanted to continue to eat healthily but wanted something decadent and yummy. I found these cookies. He eats one everyday. It satisfies his sweet tooth, and his numbers have remained within the normal range. These cookies can really be part of a healthy lifestyle, and they are delicious. Both my 12 year old and I eat them as well. My favorite is the coconut-chocolate chip."

I am not a ginger fan.)  These are by far the best.  It taste like a brownie... very yummy.  Even my friends and family that don't have allegies love it.  I have no idea why someone gave it such a poor review... guess they are able to eat a snickers bar.  And calorie wise, it's not that bad... heck of a lot better then other cookies.  I would totally recomend these.  My 2 month old loves them and so do I and my husband.  5 stars!!!"

But I'll tell ya... it's bland bland bland, tastes likes dried paste, horrible. There's a list of ingredients on each package of the stuff they 'don't' put in there like eggs, sugar, etc. Well maybe they should realize that those ingredients are 'what' makes a good cookie. I won't try anything from them again."
08	70548,B000FNB3AI,A1UJ6I72N22HT7,4/7/08,0,1,4,Soft and Moist,"I actually like this cookie very much. The reason I am not giving it a  five star is because when I took my first bite I thought that it tasted OK. I thought oh, it's vegan that's why it tastes OK. So, maybe it grew on me. But now, I just love them. They are soft and moist. They have just enough walnuts in them to give it a great flavor."
08	70547,B000FNB3AI,A30H2PF9KDXI56,5/30/08,0,1,1,Texture counts a lot in food,"The flavor of both the lemon and ginger cookies is good, and if the texture of these cookies could be improved, I might even buy them again.  The texture was grainy and distracting.  I'll try the tip about refrigerating them for the two dozen I purchased.  Maybe a better mixture of flours rather than the predominate rice flour in this cookie would help eliminate the grainy texture."

I tried this mix with just water and enjoy life gluten free dairy free chocolate chips and they were delicious!

We ate them all up and I am so happy to find something my son can enjoy that tastes good. I am back to order more."
08	37023,B000ARTNRE,A3CAXBO786Y22E,3/18/08,9,10,4,Love the Formula. Amazon delivery unpredictable.,"We normally use the powder formula but this is not that much more money and it is easier to use. The formula seems thicker than powder formula and if its anything like the difference between powdered milk and real milk it probably tastes better too. Our baby is almost 6 months old and a thicker milk is probably a good ramp up to more solid foods. We like sensitive because it is gentler on the stomach than regular formula so for the price this is a good buy.<br /><br />Only thing that has been spotty is the shipping, generally the package comes very quick, usually in 3 days from order but sometimes longer. The packaging has been strange also, the first order came in a big plastic bag with no padding. The box was breaking open and 2 bottles had dents on them. The formula seemed ok but was a strange package indeed. The second came in a regular box over another box and was much better padded. I am glad they are packaging better because I almost stopped ordering this from Amazon for that reason. At this point all is good."
08	37024,B000ARTNRE,AWMDM8W9RDHUO,4/7/08,6,6,5,good to the last drop,My grandson is thriving on this formula he was having a lot of difficulty with regular formula and this sensitive one does the trick he has gained inches and pounds and is happy and laughing we think anyone with a fussy baby should try it
08	37029,B000ARTNRE,ATGSV2BYRJSD6,3/4/08,3,3,5,Good for lactose intolerent babies,"My baby was very gassy and acidic when she was born,and still is. Iam lactose intolerant so I Figured she may be and tried many baby formulas including soy based. None of them helped until I Found the similac milk based lactose free formula(similac sensitive)My baby was so much more happy and her symptoms are gone. I have even switched back to other formulas to make sure and she always gets sick . My baby is only allowed to drink this formula are the lactaid milk that I drink.She is now one years old and wants no other type of milk. This is a very helpful formula."
08	37908,B000F6SNPS,A3002M5VUM4IHR,6/20/08,0,2,5,not all Good Earth ORIGINAL taste the same!!!,"Caution, not all Good Earth Original Caffeine Free (or with caffeine) taste the same. This one for me is the best. I made the mistake and bought ALL NATURAL Good Earth Original and it has a weaker, less tangy taste. So now when I need to purchase more tea, I look for the same design on the box and even check the scan number 27018 30135. But the best way, is ordering on Amazon with the auto shipping every three months. This is the best tasting tea. If your a tea lover THIS IS WONDERFUL."
08	70528,B000FNB3AI,A1TYQC1QMX1117,6/17/08,1,2,1,Does Not Compare To Other Nana's Cookies,These were a sore disappointment to the Nana's brand. I love the Chocolate Chip and Peanut Butter but these were way to dry and powdery. The flavor was good but the texture made my stomach turn.

It was way better. It has the addition of nuts, and the chips don't have that barley malt after taste that the ABC cookies have. I am eager to order more flavors of this cookie to try and compare, as these are much cheaper than the ABC brand, which is not currently available at amazon."
08	70515,B000FNB3AI,A28GGF2QVKE9U7,3/1/08,0,0,5,Tasty Cookies,Nana's Chocolate and chocolate Chip cookies are very tasty. They have no dairy and have all natural sugar (fruit juice) and no trans fat. I like they way they each have their own package so they stay fresher longer.<br />These are the kind of cookies that make you feel like you are eating healthier.
08	70514,B000FNB3AI,A8TO8GDVZ5G5Z,3/24/08,0,0,5,"Good cookie, good price","Some find the orange taste too strong. I don't. They are a bit pricey for cookies, but the Amazon price is good. Not for compulsive eaters, though--half a cookie is 130 calories."
08	70513,B000FNB3AI,A1ZE87EABE7FVQ,3/28/08,0,0,5,The best ever,I order from Nanas regulary. I love the coconut choco chip. So coconuty and just enough chips. Sunflower good also. They just taste good.

All 3 of my kids love them, as well as the NO GLUTEN GINGER ones. Even my gluten eating husband loved them. I only wish they weren't so expensive..."

I like healthy foods,,,we found the perfect combination of both with these,,,,they are super for people with food allergies, no eggs, no corn, no refined sugar,,,,but are absolutely moist and scrumptious,,,it's rare that my mother and I can find something like this that we both agree on,,,but these hit the mark,,,,,,,,try them, you won't be disappointed!"

I have a Nana's cookie and no after effects. Some times for breakfast I put the cookie in the micro wave for 25 seconds and put peanut butter on it. I feel like I have broken all my diet rules, (no after effect) but this is the one product that I have found that IS to good to be true. Thany you Nana."

I was surprised the description didn't make more of the no-sugar content, I was hoping for more sinful deliciousness!  But it was decent enough for healthy food."
08	70508,B000FNB3AI,A3A636L3T8RVHN,6/15/08,0,0,4,good cookie,"I ordered these off of amazon after reading several reviews.  I discovered I have multiple food allergies and this is the only ""treat"" I have found that I am able to have.  I think these cookies are great.  Good texture, if a little dense (aren't all gluten free products?), with a nice lemon flavor.  The cookies are also big, so if you want to eat just one serving, which is half the cookie, it is satisfying.  I have also tried warming them up and dipping them in a bit of rice milk, yum!  Liked them so much that I have ordered these again and have also decided to try the ginger ones too."
08	70507,B000FNB3AI,A1TYQC1QMX1117,6/17/08,0,0,5,The Best Nan's Cookie,These cookies are terrific. I cannot eat refined sugar and this is the first cookie that I have really enjoyed in this category. Other cookies that are sugar free are often too powdery or hard as rocks. Nan's Chocolate Chip were moist and delicious. Way to go Nana!
08	70506,B000FNB3AI,ABKILXH3TZLMG,6/21/08,0,0,4,Great cookie...a little pricey,"One of the things that I missed the most when I went gluten-free was a good, spicy molasses cookie.  This offering from Nana's definitely fits the bill.  I took off one star simply because it is pricey.  On the plus side, the cookies are quite big and it is nice to have an option for vegan treats.  I have tried to make gluten-free cookies of my own and have failed miserably because I try to make them healthy.  I appreciate Amazon for offering these because the company offers low prices, free shipping, and excellent customer service."
08	70505,B000FNB3AI,ARUUD2HQVTI4N,6/25/08,0,0,2,Good if you love orange,I like orange but do find this a little bit too much.  I am ok with the texture which is a little off because of the crisps but the orange is a bitter orange which seems a bit too strong to me.  I can eats these but will not reorder them.  The other Nana's I have tried were much better.
08	70504,B000FNB3AI,A17K2QBP5L3F8P,7/3/08,0,0,4,it taste very healthy!,"this is my second trial of nana's cookie collection.<br />first one was the sun flower.<br />i realli liked this cookie. it had a good combination.<br />sweetness and junkieness from the chocolate chip and the whole grainy healthy taste from the dough.<br /> but because i don't have such a sweet tooth, i would've liked it better if it had less chocolate chips."
08	70503,B000FNB3AI,AO0HPTFIKQE9B,7/8/08,0,0,4,good satisfying cookie,good moist satisfying cookie. I like these cookies because they are natural but still taste good and have enough mass to be satisfying.<br />I also like that they do not crumble and make a mess when I eat them in my office.

First Mate has their own factory and sources their products from North America. They formulate their food to be holistic, basically, what the dog needs and nothing else.  Their food is balanced and not trendy like many of the high protein diets.  Best of all...my dogs eat it!  I cannot tell you how many times I have purchased high end foods that my dogs won't go near."

Almonds in limited quantities as opposed to finishing the entire container can be quite healthy. The problem with these is that it is near impossible to stop eating them. Please note that these are not chocolate covered almonds but rather almonds with a covering of dark chocolate powder. They are healthy and quite delicious.

I was afraid to try formula because our baby is breastfeed and had trouble with gassiness from milk products I ate or drank. This was the perfect solution if you are going to try formula for the first time. We haven't had any problems for 3 weeks now. No fussiness, no gassiness, no spit up:o) You hear all the horror stories about formula and how it affects our babies...well this one has been great! We still breastfeed but supplement with formula. Also, make sure when you go to buy this formula you look for Fussy and Gassy...Similac makes another sensitive formula to reduce spit up. This one has an Orange lable and the other one is more of a pinkish orange...like salmon:o)Here's to Happy Eating!"

I do not know about anyone else but to me strong tea makes me feel pretty darn good, almost like I am getting away with something (funny, since its perfectly legal..) and perks me up on my branch and all of a sudden I want to do things and stop dozing off. I want to create, to ponder on issues otherwise reserved for the acute minded, I want to get so high from that tea that I might start laughing for no valid reason, make a fool of myself. Can anyone tell I am on it right now? I am as happy as a clam. Once I drink it early in the morning and I am a little moody for thinking I did not sleep well and I am Bitchy and un-accessible to the world the Morning Thunder takes care of setting my course straight. I am sure there are many strong teas and by God, I would like to meet them all, but Morning Thunder is under my roof so it gets 4 Stars for being there, help to accentuate the self for the productive side of things.

Here's a few pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price wise - great price, $14.99 after 15% with Subscribe & Save and Free shipping for 240 tea bags comes out to around 6.2 cents each tea bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />Figured they be individually wrapped like the I Love Lemon tea but it's not. These 40 count boxes are not packaged individually in foil packs but there are 4 tea bags in 1 foil pack and not resealable.  Therefore, if you're not a frequent tea drinker, the tea bags might loose freshness after you open the foil pack after a few days.  If you want individually packaged tea bags, you should look at the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).<br /><br />If I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than a minute, I will see loose tea particles on the bottom of my cup, leaving the last mouthful of tea undrinkable. This problem does not happen in the I Love Lemon tea by Bigelow even if I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than 10 mins.  I'm not sure if there's a same problem in the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) because I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />Taste wise - okay, same as any ordinary green tea.<br /><br />Drink for health benefits!"

Of course, it is necessary to use the best coffee, and that can only be found at Peet's. The coffee must be ground very fine, and since I like strong coffee, I use two scoops to make one cup.<br />OK, here's the rest of the drill: First insert the filter paper in the cone, position it over the cup and fill with hot water. The hot water rinses the filter and preheats the cup. Next, add two scoops (or one and a half if you like your coffee weaker)and lightly tamp it down to pack it but do not tear the filter. Pour the hot water out of the cup. Replace the filter and coffee over the cup and add a small amount of hot water, wetting the grounds. DO NOT USE BOILING HOT WATER! Boiling hot water dissolves acids and makes the coffee bitter. The water temperature should be about 180 to 190 Fahrenheidt. After the first bit of water had drained into the cup, add more water.<br />Even if you have been used to adding sugar to your coffee, please try it without. There will be no bitterness and in fact, you can make the coffee stronger than you ever imagined and there'll be no bitterness.<br />You are welcome!"

Finding the correct rice (arborio) was difficult enough, and after trying the brands from 2 or 3 different stores, we decided RiceSelect made for the best Risotto.  We used to buy it at SuperTarget before finding it here on Amazon.<br /><br />Our basic recipe:<br /><br />Serves 3-4, as a side<br /><br />1 cup RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto<br />1 tablespoon olive oil<br />1/3 cup cooking wine (we've tried all kinds)<br />4-5 cups chicken broth<br />1 - 1 1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese (NOT the powder kind)<br />1 tablespoon butter (optional)<br /><br />Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a shallow saucepan over medium heat and add risotto rice.  Stir risotto for a couple of minutes then add cooking wine.  CAUTION:  the wine will cook off rapidly and could cause steam that will burn you if you're not careful!  Stir 30 - 60 seconds until all wine has been absorbed then add 1 cup chicken broth.  SAME CAUTION AS ABOVE!  Stir constantly until broth has been absorbed, then add another 1/2 cup of broth.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  Wait until the previous amount of broth has been absorbed/cooked off before adding the next.  It typically takes about 20 minutes to make the risotto.  You'll know you're ready for the next step when the Risotto is soft, but not mushy.  You'll notice as you're adding chicken broth, that most of the liquid will be absorbed or cooked off, leave you will a creamy base.<br />Remove risotto from heat and add one cup parmesan cheese.  Stir until melted.  Serve immediately.  Garnish with extra parmesan cheese.<br /><br />OPTIONAL:  if after adding parmesan, the risotto seems stiff, add one tablespoon of butter.  Or if you like butter, add butter! ;-)<br /><br />RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto has consistently given us great results and we're always sure to have 2 or 3 containers in the pantry."

He seemed to be slipping away. After reading about possible food allergies and the fact that cats don't need any carbohydrates since they are obligate carnivores, I examined a lot of cat-food labels at my local super pet store, looking for an all-meat food. This is the only one I found. My cat immediately began gaining weight and has been completely healthy since he started eating it about six weeks ago. He has remained slim, active and playful.

My over wieght boy has slimmed down quite a bit since switching him to only wet food and this brand (mostly, I also feed them some EVO cans as well).

How I found this rice is maybe unusual. When I am normal, I zip through the grocery store, attending business, then I'm out of there. When I am depressed, I spend two hours in the store. I look at everything. I imagine my life another way. With this rice, I thought, how exotic could I make a meal for a small dinner party? I thought of Royal Blend served in little white ceramic Chinese rice bowls I bought in San Francisco. Set the bowl right on the plate. I have colorful plates that I mix-match for fun and variety. Serve with grilled salmon fillets. Get out a vegetable cookbook for ideas there.Everything has to be fun and cheerful. This rice certainly is colorful and fun to eat. Its slightly nutty taste and hint of crunchiness would wow the taste buds and complement the salmon.<br /><br />Cooking this rice also saves time. Mix the water, rice, butter, and seasonings all together, then cook 15 minutes as opposed to 20 for white. Besides, Royal Blend contains no fat, just a touch of sodium, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of protein, and one gram of fiber, making this hands down a superior product of rice.<br /><br />The second point is the availability of the containers. Once the rice is gone, I wash the container then use it to hold my various varieties of dried beans. The plastic jars look identical and neat all lining the counter top. Add attractiveness to the look.<br /><br />Royal Blend costs a little more, but aren't you worth it?"

I eat it several nights a week.  It goes great with chicken and steamed vegetables for a healthy dinner.  There are no additives, just an assortment of different rice.  It also has an interesting texture, not too crunchy, but not mushy like white rice.<br /><br />For a healthy solution to side dishes with MSG like rice-a-roni or even semolina pasta, this is the best I've found!"

Yes, diabetics can eat it because it's only half (or less) the blood sugar elevating agent of the same volume of 'real' sugar. It's also why it tastes like 'real' sugar and can be cooked unlike some sugar sustitutes. A lot of non-sucrose-based sweetners are destroyed by heat.<br /><br />What I've found with this Splenda brown sugar is, even though it's bulked up so that it's supposed to be equivalent in volume to all-sucrose, it's really very, very sweet so I do not substitute it 1:1 for sugar. I use much less than I would real sugar."

Cocoa flavoring is not overpowering. Nuts are firm and easy to chew. The 11 oz package is a good size plus the shape is very good. I like the large indentations on two sides which make the outer container easy to hold with one hand. Seems to be one of those ""can't stop eating it"" kinds of foods. It's really that good. The serving size according to the package is 11 however I expect to finish the product in 3 to 4 servings. The handy screw top is nice too and would seem to keep this item fresh between servings. This is something I would order fairly often and keep in my house to share with anyone who drops by for a visit. I also found the product information on the back easy to read against a light green background."

08	37845,B000GRGSS0,A171M5DH43XNX3,1/19/08,1,1,4,Good ghee and good price,I like this ghee even though it is a bit different than what I'm used to. It is a bit lighter and more solid than ghee you get at the Indian grocer. I don't particularly like the ghee at the Indian grocer though. The ghee at the Indian store is often rancid and the containers it is in alters the taste. I like this ghee though because it is natural and is in glass jars opposed to plastic/tin. It has a good smell and taste to it. I also like that it is in small jars and I don't have to scoop some out of a big container everytime I use it. I use it on my chapati (flat bread) and it tastes much healthier than other ghee. I highly recommend it!

The result was not very commendable....<br /><br />It is then I came across Tazaa ghee.... the first time I tasted it, it reminded me of my home made ghee back in India and since then I have been hooked.....I am a regular customer of Tazaa ghee on amazon.com for the last 2 years....<br /><br />Great product, affordable prize and the best online seller... the combination is irresistible!!!"

As long as I stay off too much salt in the diet and decaf, low fat I have been able to stay off medication for high blood pressure.  I can keep that steady with the decaf green tea, this was a bargain for a case lot.  Having the shipping free and delivery in two days it is a saving all around."

She will eat almost anything, whether or not it agrees with her intestinal system, but I wanted something healthy for her that would not have us running for the outdoor potty all day (or night) long.  She liked Iams, but ended up being constipated half the time, also unpleasant! I saw some trial-sized bags in a pet store, and bought a couple. OMG, can I say my dog loves this food AND it agrees with her system? In addition to it being a great food (check out the ingredients), I can literally give her pieces of this as treats and rewards, she likes it that much.  So many people who saw her when I first got her, and see her now, are extremely impressed at how much better she looks too. Since no one food is perfect for every dog, I highly recommend trying a small bag first, and then see if your dog likes it as much as mine does.  As much as she likes it, I think she actually eats a bit less of it, because it's denser in calories, proteins and vitamins than most other foods, so it works out pricewise to be reasonable. I've also given it to my foster dogs, and their coats also improved on this food."

They're less oily and I don't feel sick or guilty after having some.  The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack, but the 3.25 ounce bags end up being cheaper so I divide it up into 3 ziplock bags once I open them.  It works great!"

A 20 count box of Lipton green tea bags is $2.99 at the local Kmart which makes the 240 bags in this box, a $36 retail value, a steal at $20.  The only negative in this review is that once brewed, the tea looks nothing like a green tea.  Instead, it has a nice golden brown appearance like the normal Lipton product.  I bought a bottle of Lipton diet green tea as a comparison and found the 1.5 liter bottle to be good, but too sweet for my taste.  Instead, 6 tea bags and four packets of splenda make the same amount of tea, but much more palatable.  At six bags per bottle, I can make forty bottles of a tea that was about $2 retail for just $20.  If you're intent on having a tea that is a pale light green then this product is not for you.  However, it's a good value, if not exactly the product being advertised."

Now living on the East Coast, I became disgusted with the overly-sugary, fake-tasting coconut flakes found in typical grocery stores, so I was delighted to find this product. I mix these coconut flakes with some of the coconut milk powder and warm water, and after letting the flakes soak for a few minutes, I eat the mixture straight out of the bowl.

I will eventually get around to using these flakes in baked goods, but it's so good plain that I'm reluctant to mix it with anything else.<br /><br />i will definitely order more when I finish my current supply."

My cat, although he isn't thrilled with getting the occasional ""tummy pill,"" does do pretty well with them and doesn't usually throw too bad of a fit. My girlfriend's cat on the other hand, is quite the opposite. That little bugger will throw one of the biggest fits you ever seen when you attempt to give him a pill. You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together!<br /><br />Anyhow, we bought some of these ""pill hiding treats"" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking. The very first time we tried them we were both a bit apprehensive wondering if we had just wasted some money on treats instead of the normal band-aids which come in quite handy at pill time. Needless to say, these ""pill pockets"" worked!<br /><br />We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned.<br /><br />Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the ""pill hiding treat"" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little bugger was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill.<br /><br />Now we give him several ""pill hiding treats"" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one. This has been working now for about a month, but I figure were running out of time on this one and had better start thinking up a new plan of attack before we are once again outsmarted by the cat.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover"

After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is ""insipid"" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan."

This is your basic, everyday black tea but it is much more flavorful and bolder than the Lipton variety sold in supermarkets here. It brews a good, bracing cup of tea. I recommend it over the supermarket variety any day. I have used this to make iced tea as well and while it's good over ice, it is best served hot."

Hearing that they have good coffee, I went and found my latte to be marvelous, better than anything at Starbucks or Caribou coffee.  Since then, I gone in on numerous occasions and had their full range of drinks, including their drip coffee.  Thinking that I could save some money, I bought this coffee to make myself a fresh cup in the morning.  I was careful to get the right grind size for my french press.  My homemade coffee does not compare with the illy's made coffee.  I dunno if they use fresher beans or what, but I found this coffee from Amazon to be dull, flavorless and definitely not worth the $26 price.  I only used 1/2 of the canister before switching over to Peets.  If you're in the mood for illy's, you should just go to their cafe to get a cup, otherwise brew something else at home."

This creates the illusion you have put a lot more work into the dinner than you actually did.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.

I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor.  I found it in a Food Max in Stockton, Ca but then the store closed down.  I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also.  I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it, so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from.  The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all.  This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store.  I am buying enough to share with my friends....."

They taste just like the flavor they're supposed to and aren't too sweet for a quick snack. They still hold you over until you can get some actual food in your stomach, which is great. I keep these around as much as I can! My favorite GF flavors are key lime pie, pecan pie, apple pie, and banana nut bread."

Nope, that's not what happened.  It turned out that these are almonds that are dusted in cocoa.  The chocolate flavor is really rich, mainly because it's dark chocolate.  I like these as a treat, and I realized that they'd go really well with a cup of coffee.  They aren't snack food, unless the snacker has really odd sense of taste.  I found that they're best if you just eat about two or three of them at a time, with or without coffee.  Come to think of it, I'll likely brew me up a cup of a rich French or African roast, just because that cup of java would go well with this treat.  Be careful, however, when opening the container because the pungent flavor might make you sneeze.  More than three dusted almonds will also likely dry out your mouth."

08	68978,B0018KR8V0,A3Q8WSHXGHZIMA,1/30/08,1,1,5,Wonderful fruit and nuts on the go,"This bar is great for getting raw fruit and nuts into your family. Could the nuts be chopped a bit smaller? Sure. But then the whole bar would be too mushy. Could they use fewer dates (to cut the sugar) and make the bar as moist? Doubtful. Cheries are tough as dried fruit goes, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the excessive dates. (Note, though, I can't stand plain dates and I don't notice the flavor or find them overwhelming. I'd just like a more tart, less sweet bar.)<br />This is the alternative to giving yourself and your family dried fruit--this bar is softer, easier to share, and slightly more flavorful than the best dried fruit. It makes nuts palatable to kids who think they don't like nuts. And that means more protein into your diet (though not as much as I'd like, it has exponentially more than plain fruit).<br />Great bar. Good price through Amazon. Stash these bars in your car, your briefcase, your desk drawer, your diaper bag, your kids' backpacks, and your family's workout bags."
08	68979,B0018KR8V0,A1G5A8NMZT9QIL,1/29/08,1,1,5,Taste like Cherry Pie,These are wonderful for travel and snacks.  The taste is great.  Most rawfood that is suppose to taste like something cooked doesn't to me.  This does.  They have a new flavor key lime pie that is also great.
08	68980,B0018KR8V0,A3TJBSMGZHBZQ1,1/12/08,1,1,5,yummy!,"While looking for a healthy, all natural, food to eat on my long runs, i found the larabars. I had tried some other bars that were more fruity and had some sugar crashes. The larabars did not cause that effect on me. I have tried many of the flavors and find them surprisingly delicious for something so healthy. The cinnamon roll, cashew cookie, apple pie, and gingersnap are my favorites so far. The cherry pie was too cherry for me. This is a snack you can feel good about eating!"
08	55288,B008Z4VAPM,A27NTH2Y9DAR31,10/15/08,3,3,5,Holds its own against any restaurant miso soup,"This is the best miso soup to be found anywhere; it is fabulous and the flavor is just amazing considering it's an instant soup. You can add a variety of vegetables, chicken pieces, pork, beef or shrimp if you like, and chopped spinach and if you love tofu you can add either the firm or soft variety, I prefer the soft.<br />The soup is comprised of fermented soy beans and comes in red (sweeter) or white (saltier) miso paste and fish stock made from bonito flakes and contains kelp as well. I am going to a local Asian market where I live and make my own miso from scratch but bought more of this as backup just in case mine doesn't turn out. It is a very delicate soup and cannot ever be boiled once the bonito is added as it would collapse and the flaovr would be ruined, so I watched videos on how to prepare it.<br />Many years ago when I was in college in downtown Los Angeles, we would go to little Tokyo for lunch and indulge in the then relatively unknown treat, sushi and have the miso and a wonderful salad of finely chopped cabbage and rice vinegar to start.<br />Now I can buy (and do) sushi freshly prepared at my local supermarket and have instant miso whenever I want and that is my idea of Heaven. Miso has the most delicate flavor imaginable, it is absolutely unique, nothing else tastes remotely like it and it is very healthy for you as well.<br />When I went to a fat farm the main reason we all lost so much weight was because the diet plan at this particular place included having a large cup of hot broth before every meal thus cutting the appetite down considerably. I could really put it away before, just huge gluttonous portions, but after finishing the cup of broth, I could eat what they gave us but no more than that.<br />So whether you want in instant soup like no other or want to incorporate this soup into your diet plan, either way you'll be very happy and remember to experiment by adding whatever you like and making it more of a meal.<br />To paraphrase a quote from Benjamin Franklin (re beer) miso is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy. Enjoy!"

They are delicious, healthy, and they're the perfect little snack to keep in my bag for after the gym. BUT BE AWARE, many of the flavors (like the chocolate, cinnamon roll, and cherry pie) are all over powered by the flavor of dates. They're not bad, but there is nothing else you can taste in those flavors besides dates and nuts. I would buy one to try before investing in a whole box of the flavor you're looking for."

That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!"

The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.<br /><br />While the tea bags are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!<br /><br />Each packet is 100 calories.<br /><br />Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.<br /><br />If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

The vegetables are mashed to almost smooth.  It's very good to pour over rice or as a topping for meat.  I bought it to take to work for a quick lunch, and it suits.  The only drawback is the packaging.  The inner pouch isn't microwaveable, so the product must be squeezed out into a bowl before heating (it tends to cling to the pouch a little, too)."

Rishi Earl Grey Tea is good, aromatic and flavorful. The tea is not that strong for an Earl Grey, definitely not bold, but it is strong enough (just add another tablespoon to make it stronger). I steeped this tea for a long time (forgot about it) and it never became that bitter (I never add anything to my tea). It never felt strong or bold for that matter. The taste is long lasting though. Borrowing from the wine world, it has a long finish. The tea has a faint yellow ring in the cup and a brownish-orangy color.<br /><br />The tea is very aromatic and the container contains an extra lid to keep the aroma and freshness of the tea.<br /><br />It is a bit overpriced but, at least you can reuse the leaves a few times. This is also a fair trade organic product.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the video. Please let me know if you want any more info."

Specifically the KOI Kashmiri Basmati rice! The portions are perfect as well when mixing the two.<br /><br />It was very tasty and quite filling too. This is probably my current favorite KOI meal. I've tried the rajma masala, dal bukara, pindi chana, and palak paneer. My second favorite would have to be the pindi chana. The rajma is OK but I don't prefer the flavor as much. The palak paneer is a little bland but oddly spicy. And the dal bukara is quite salty."

Most coffee shops I have visited actually use Oregon Chai, so you will be getting the exact same thing.  However, the liquid concentrate version is much better than the powdered form (coffee shops use the liquid version) so unless you need portable packets for work, get the liquid.<br /><br />One other thing - not too long ago I ran into a box of packets that wouldn't dissolve correctly.  I sent an email to Oregon Chai and within the SAME DAY they shipped me a whole new box!  Outstanding service from an outstanding company.  These guys really care about making you happy and they will go to any length to do so.  After that experience they have a loyal customer for life."

Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh."

It's great with milk and a splash of honey. I tried other chais, but the spices were often overpowering. This one is so good I bring some with me when I travel, since restaurants rarely have it.

It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!"

The apple pie version is nicely chewy, with a taste of rolled oats, cinnamon, raisin, and, of course, apple, though it's not as intense or satisfying a fruit flavor as their Cherry Pie bar.  The apple hits you especially in the aftertaste, which is very satisfying.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side, but neither boring or cloying, and without that awful artificial taste mentioned above.<br /><br />The ingredient list is all one needs to read to discover the ""secret"" of Lara's natural taste:<br />Dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon. That's it! This is absolutely unheard of in type of food! Go to any comparable product (e.g., Cliff, Balance, Promax, South Beach, etc.) and you will find a veritable mine of vitamin and mineral additives.  For that reason alone (OK, and the concomitant wonderfully natural taste), these stand leagues above the competition.<br /><br />Does this reliance on natural foods cost you in nutrition?  I don't know--that's one for doctors and dietitians. However, I can list the nutritional values here:<br /><br />In one bar, you ingest the following:<br /><br />One serving (45 grams) provides 180 Calories--90 of them from fat;  10 g, Total Fat, of which only 1 gram is saturated fat,  4 grams are monounsaturated, and 4.5 grams are polyunsaturated (no trans fat, although, interesting enough, those grams add only to 9.5);  NO Cholesterol; 5mg of Sodium: 280mg, Potassium; 23 grams, Total Carbohydrate. Of which 4 grams are fiber and 17 grams, sugar (all that fruit), and 4 grams of protein. IT also provides 1 gram of Omega-3 and 4 grams of Omega 6 fatty acids.

08	69143,B0018KR8V0,A3Z8QK73YK2II,3/1/08,6,6,5,Great for hiking or breakfast on the go,"These bars are my favorite trail food. One makes a good breakfast. Two make a decent lunch while hiking. Not as sticky as Powerbars and Cliffbars, although I like those too.<br /><br />Others have commented that they are high in fat, calories and carbohydrates. What's wrong with that? These are not rice cakes, they are energy bars. The ingredients are: dates, almonds, unsweetened cherries. No added sugar. Non-gmo, gluten-, dairy- and soy-free. Vegan and kosher. No trans fat. One bar has only 3% of your recommended daily value of saturated fat. Healthier than lots of alternatives.<br /><br />Cherry and Lemon are great. Apple is almost as good. Pecan is just so-so. Haven't tried the other flavors yet.<br /><br />It's hard for me to believe that mold could grow on these because they are pretty dry.  Maybe it was crystalized sugar? My box from Amazon is labelled best by 12/2008, and they are all fine.<br /><br />I like these so much that I signed up for regular Amazon deliveries through Subscribe and Save.  Now I won't have to depend on Costco for a steady supply.  Keep up the good work, Humm Foods!"

08	69163,B0018KR8V0,AD5P7TIKU50MI,7/3/08,0,0,5,yummy!,"I am a fan of Larabars in general, and this is a really good variety! I keep Larabars in my purse, etc. for breakfast, snacks, etc. I have used other food bars, but Larabars are my favorite. I also like the lemon, apple pie and the chocolate varieties. These are real food!"

They contain no more than 6 ingredients such as walnuts, almonds and cashews to provide protein and the ""good fats"" as well as such fruits as dates, bananas, cherries and apple which give your body the carbohydrates it needs for energy. Compare them to any other bar on the market and you will see how the short list of simple ingredients adds up to great nutrition as well as great taste."

High time I replaced refined processed crap with something that tastes better and satisfies the same.  Yeah, gotta watch the calories but they are GOOD calories!!  No sugar crashes either - just steady happy humming!  THANK YOU!!"
08	69166,B0018KR8V0,A9V90QJLW457A,6/2/08,0,0,5,just so good!,I love having snack all day long. and this is just perfect for me whenever I feel like craving some things small or on the go. it's yummy. not tooo sweet like other brand. I just love them. :)
08	69167,B0018KR8V0,A1G6SR27YE9WMO,5/28/08,0,0,5,These are awesome,"I love these bars.  It is almost like eating a piece of cherry pie, but so much better for you.  I wish I could afford to have them all the time!"
08	69168,B0018KR8V0,A2PCQGMKUCXBU9,5/10/08,0,0,5,Love them!,"I can't say enough about the banana cookie larabar.  I love them, they're all natural, and they're a great replacement for unhealthy snacks."
08	69169,B0018KR8V0,A33HCKBSJBAQCK,5/1/08,0,0,5,great healthfood bar,This is a great healthfood bar that is very satisfying and tastes great!  Even my picky eaters in the house like it.  The cashews are wonderful and you can't even tell that you are eating dates!  Love them!  We eat them all the time for quick breakfasts or afternoon snacks.  Enjoy!
08	69170,B0018KR8V0,A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR,2/5/08,0,0,4,excellent and filling little bar!,"I first bought Lara bars at a local grocery store, drawn by the idea of a bar that was nothing more than fruits and nuts. No additives. No added sugar. Yum!<br /><br />I was pretty pleased by the taste of my first purchases, and I liked these a lot, too.<br /><br />The taste of these is a bit tart (it's lemon, after all), but sweet at the same time.<br /><br />The texture is very soft, but with the tiny crunch of minced nuts.<br /><br />Excellent!"
08	6234,B000E1HVW0,A12RD7OFR4T2K1,12/8/08,10,10,5,Family Favorite,"I can't imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item. If you haven't tried it you must, it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake. It has a very different flavor than any BBQ sauce on the market, a flavor all it's own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish. I have made stuffing, mashed potatoes (a favorite) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken.It's perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion. I am always afraid that they will stop making it, it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it, kids all seem to love it and I love it because it is quick and easy. It's a very unique flavor, I want to say a little sweeter than most BBQ sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey BBQ but better, that can be used on pork chops as well. There is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but I find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way. I put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed, then I rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating (shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated) and then place them into a baking pan that I line with foil, it makes clean up much easier after cooking, almost don't need to wash the pan this way.Try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken. Any mix left in the packet I shake on pieces that don't look completely covered and then just on top of all of them. I usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate. It becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate, your fingers and of course the chicken pieces. I have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too, but honestly you don't need to add anything it is delicious the way it is. Cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesn't sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results. I would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think."
08	69171,B0018KR8V0,A1P44I61CP16BW,1/19/08,0,0,5,THE BEST ENERGY FOOD BAR & IT'S RAW!,"Lara Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cashew Cookie, is the most delicious food bar I have ever tasted.  Besides being so yummy, I love the fact that it's RAW and therefore all the nutrition from the dates and cashews is kept intact.<br /><br />I always keep extra bars in my car or purse so that these tasty bars are always available to satisfy my hunger wherever I go.  One bar will keep me going for one to two hours, which is a blessing when I can't eat a regular meal."
08	3909,B000CC9V42,A3157ON0TTGHLV,1/15/08,1,2,5,Excellent Selection of Sauces,"Excellent Customer Service, Quick Ship, VERY well packed merchandise. My new supplier of all things HOT!."

They really aren't that bad in terms of calories at 180 cal. for the whole box and they take a while to eat and that's always a good thing when you are watching your calories.<br /><br />They taste yummy (sweet and sour) and in terms of treats, they are in my top ten for sure."
08	84708,B0013OXEC8,AXI0MIK6J1JJR,10/28/08,1,1,4,WUYI TEA,Not a bad tasting tea!! And actually does seem to help with appetite suppressing. Good value for money.
08	69172,B0018KR8V0,A32ZB8VVWCDU8M,1/17/08,0,0,5,Simple Ingredients Make for a Great Food Bar,"Lara's simplicity is it's greatest asset. Delicious cashew and dates taste. I've gotten into the habit of keeping a few in my car's glovebox. While I have not tasted many of the other Lara Bar flavors, this one is superb."
08	69173,B0018KR8V0,A2LINNB0T986FU,1/6/08,0,0,5,My favorite energy bar,"This is my favorite energy bar.  Most of the time I prefer to eat real food, but there are occasions (long hikes, motorcycle trips) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished, and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up.  I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I'm not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos.  I like that there are not any artificial flavors or colors, no ingredients I cannot pronounce or have to look up in a dictionary, and no preservatives.  This is my favorite flavor, followed closely by the lemon."
08	69174,B0018KR8V0,A16KGGZY2VZ9O5,1/5/08,0,0,5,Yummy!,I love Larabars but the Pecan Pie bars are by far my favorite.  These make a fantastic breakfast or lunch on the go.  I love knowing that when I hand one to my kids they are getting nothing but natural ingredients.  My husband's favorite is the Cherry Pie and the kids like the Cinnamon Role.
08	214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,8/31/08,3,10,1,CHANGED FORMULA MAKES CATS SICK!!!!,"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!"
08	69997,B0009YUCZA,ASXDTCEEWU8L4,8/4/08,0,0,5,Wonderful Scent for a dog!,This is the best rinse for dogs that we have ever found. I use it on my Mini Schnauzer and he smells so sweet--and I recommended it to my daughter who has a very SMELLY Black Lab....and she loves it too! Her house used to smell like dog as soon as you came through the door--even though she keeps it so clean--because her dog smelled--there is no doggy smell in my house now! Try it! for 5 bucks it's worth the chance believe me.
08	28444,B0016FRI8A,A3TG3FPAFO0SWT,7/3/08,2,2,5,Good for on the go,I like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea.  I've added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks.  I have fun mixing it with things.  It blends well for me.
08	28443,B0016FRI8A,A2YQCZEHOJZLQL,9/1/08,2,2,5,Great health benefits,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
08	44702,B001EQ55RW,A1UKA7HUAQAMY,5/19/08,0,0,4,Good Almonds,"I like a good nut, and these Emerald Cocoa Roast nuts are pretty good nuts.  As I am also a chocoholic, though, my opinion may be biased.  :-)<br /><br />Not that these are overly chocolate-flavored.  This is not a chocolate covered almond.  Instead, these are almonds coated in cocoa powder.  It's not even glazed--just dusted, stuck on with oil.  Because the cocoa powder isn't strongly sweetened, you get a good mix of nut flavor with a chocolate chaser.  They're subtle, and good for a little munching ... but not for prolonged snacking; I found that after five or six nuts, they sort of lost flavor in my mouth until I cleansed my palette with a drink.<br /><br />All in all, these nuts are a nice change of pace from typical salted fare, without bringing the heavy sweetness of a honey raost to the party.  I would definitely buy them again."
08	481,B000G6RYNE,A12OF4IM7A8YS,7/4/08,0,0,5,"Excellent balance of taste, crunchiness, and moisture",I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.
08	480,B000G6RYNE,A1RRHET1QIP1YK,7/5/08,0,0,5,Great Chip!,"I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
08	69970,B0002ZILVI,A3CIFBFBMY5GEU,5/12/08,0,1,4,Great Bone but Wish I got a larger one,"Our dog loves her bone and it's a really great product, but when we leave her in her crate it falls through the cracks of the crate onto the floor.  I would have preferred a larger bone even though I bought the size appropriate for my puppy.  Other than that it is a great product and I recommend it."
08	69969,B0002ZILVI,A31YSB7ZVW5AQ3,8/13/08,0,1,3,Be careful,"My puppy has had a couple of these bones, and I don't recommend them. She can chew the ends of them down quite quickly (and she isn't a large breed puppy), so I can only let her have one for ten or fifteen minutes at a time if I want it to last longer than a few days. The Nylabone puppy fish toys are a few dollars more, but are more durable and have lasted much longer."
08	69968,B0002ZILVI,A1PT5TEBOSXJOV,12/31/08,0,0,5,My bullmastiff puppy loves this bone,I currently have an 11 week old bullmastiff puppy and she absolutely loves this bone. She chews it nonstop and it has stood up well to the punishment. I would definitely recommend this for any one who has a large breed puppy.
08	37328,B003CK2BQG,A8IF4ZBZRY86C,12/15/08,2,2,5,this is excellent chai green tea,i love the Stash Chai i couldnt believe this was green tea. i'll drink it when its this good. highly recommend all the chai's but this one is very good.
08	37329,B003CK2BQG,AC8UT5SYUP313,11/15/08,2,2,4,Yum!,The Moroccan Mint Green Tea by Stash is simply delightful.  I generally enjoy 1-3 cups a day (considering I have six boxes to consume) and each one is delicious.  The mint and lemongrass keep the tea from being too astringent.
08	54646,B0000V828G,A2K3QMFDYBKFYS,2/27/08,2,2,5,FABULOUS!!!!,"My Mini Dachshund has food allergies and I fed her Natural Choice, Lamb Meal and Rice, Dry, for the first 4 years of her life until I read [...].  Since then, I have tried my Mini Dachshund and Jack Russell Terrier on Canidae, Lamb Meal and Rice, Dry.  They weren't thrilled with the taste so I mixed it with some of the remaining Natural Choice.  That bag is empty so I am trying Newman's Own Adult Dog Chicken Formula, Dry.  I purchased the 4 lb. bag to see if my dogs liked it.  They were trying to get into the bag before I opened it.  They are crazy about the taste and I have never seen them gobble up the food so quickly.  I will purchase the 25 lb. bag next time.  It may be more expensive than other brands but it is good for their health and yummy, too!!!!"

08	54645,B0000V828G,A2ZD4NQ3DIC9XM,7/14/08,5,5,5,Good Stuff,"I have two pugs, who have been on Newman's Own Organic dog food and treats for about 6 months now, with great results. While your dog will survive on any commercial dog food, the better the food you offer them, the healthier they will be and more longeivty they will have.  If nothing else, feeding a food like this one, because it is more nutrient-dense and does not contain undigestible fillers such as corn...less poop!<br />I previously fed Innova, which I was happy with, but made the switch to Newman's on principal.  Newman's donates all thier proceeds to related charities and has a seriously strong reputation for being a never-test-on-animals manufacturer (I know it's funny to not test dog food on dogs, but I don't mean taste testing- I mean ugly, awful, kept-in-cages-and-injected, etc. animal testing) and environmentally-friendly and organic (because less hormones and pesticides is healthier!) company.  Innova won't share thier practices..."
08	9900,B000F47E00,A3CM3GMHM3QJSP,6/23/08,0,0,5,Great value!,"I have a small gourmet catering business and have a couple of dessert items I use vanilla beans for.  One recipe calls for 3 full vanilla beans for each recipe!  One can image how expensive that would be at $4 - $6 per bean!  This Melissa's box was an incredible buy at just over $1 per bean...the beans are supple and their flavor is very good.  As another reviewer mentioned, they are not the most coveted bean but for most purposes they are excellent!  I highly recommend this purchase for anyone who uses a lot of vanilla beans or who can find someone to share them with.  I don't know how long they will remain fresh because I haven't had that issue, but as quickly as I use them, I don't expect to.  This is a tremendous value!!"
08	23386,B000X9NRKS,A3MMFDUMQV1LQ5,10/15/08,1,2,5,Better Than Ears!!!,"My dogs love these. With real ears, I'm afraid that they will get lodged in their throat, but there's no danger of that with these."
08	37330,B003CK2BQG,A2IPHGXIAYZNJK,8/24/08,2,2,5,Wake Up Call,My wife and I enjoy a pot of Green Chai Tea each morning.  It has a great flavor.  It is a little hard to find in grocery stores at the quantity that we like.  Hint... set it up as a subscription and you will pay less than most grocery stores and you will have it delivered to your door.
08	69212,B0018KR8V0,A1QV4VPFKPDGBF,7/20/08,0,1,5,Yummy!,"I love bananas so, when we got this bars I was pleased with the way they tasted..But the best part is all the good stuff the use to make them.They have a few ingredients..They are 90% raw..Is all good!! They are worth the money!!.I like the fact that they don't contain soy..People think soy is really healthy but is has estrogen components that help you storage fat around your waist..  Anyways buy them!!"
08	23383,B000X9NRKS,A1WRCYEULK79SZ,6/28/08,0,0,5,Beagle Pleasing Yummies!,"I have two Beagles and they LOVE these treats. Keep them in a sealed container or they get hard and stale quickly. Your dogs may not mind though. To keep my beagles happy I play a game with them called ""Find It"". I put them out in the garage and then hide pieces of treats all over the house.<br />Then I open the door, making sure I'm not standing in their path and say ""Find It!"". Not that I actually have to say anything at all. They know the game. These treats are great for that because you can tear of cut them up into pieces for hiding or rewards.<br /><br />This treat comes in Chicken Flavor too. Eight Paws up from Snoopy and Chester!"
08	85770,B000FCI6JU,A414GMVC6NMC1,9/10/08,18,18,5,Great Stuff!,"I love chocolate extract, and I'm so happy to have found a source that is cheaper than the outlets I normally buy from.  One warning:  Chocolate Extract only boosts the chocolate notes of products already containing some kind of chocolate or cocoa powder. Used in non chocolate baking, it brings a boost of flavor that may make someone ask ""what is that I'm tasting?"".  They may recognize chocolate, but you don't have to tell them what it is!"
08	44703,B001EQ55RW,A10Y0CLCJ1L4LA,5/18/08,0,0,5,Pleasantly surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised by the Cocoa Roast almonds. They are not dipped in chocolate like a candy, but dusted with a slightly sweet cocoa powder that does not overpower the natural taste of the almonds. It is enough to make a person who does not usually snack on almonds (me) keep reaching for more. They're totally healthy, and totally addictive. A+."
08	69218,B0018KR8V0,A17MRLOTRR975U,2/1/08,1,3,3,Meh.,"These aren't horrible, but as a Celiac, I was really excited at the reviews that said these bars really tasted like cinnamon rolls. They don't. I think the cinnamon flavor is a little strong, but otherwise they taste like dates & nuts. That's great, if that's what you're going for. I'm a bigger fan of the lemon flavor ones. They have a good strong lemon flavor without being too sweet."
08	37331,B003CK2BQG,A2YDG8QP57UDE3,6/15/08,2,2,5,Delicious,My local grocery store stopped carrying this brand - but it turns out a better deal through Amazon anyway.  This is my AM beverage of choice!

08	69222,B0018KR8V0,A1I34N9LFOSCX7,11/22/08,0,3,3,not too crazy about the flavor....,"not as good as i expected from the ratings on here. they are not sweet at all & kind of too tart but has over 20 grams of sugar in 1 bar???  but they are made with raw, healthy ingredients so i will eat them. maybe i'll try another flavor next time."
08	37631,B002R81L92,A1GV7IZH5HHVHG,6/5/08,5,5,5,Fantastic product,"If you love chocolate and fruits, this is the product for you. I have just finished my first bag, and I still can't get over the taste. The candies are bite-size, and (even though I hate using cliches) you simply can't get enough of them. The chocolate doesn't taste bitter, but it's not too sweet either, and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch. Overall, just like those commercials say, your mouth will thank you."
08	44704,B001EQ55RW,AIWDGRTLV7IQF,5/18/08,0,0,4,"Lovely, but also light.","These are nice... the almonds are fresh, and the light cocoa coating is tasty and not bitter.  The marriage here of chocolate and almond is just right; the only negative thing any person could ever say is this:  compared to an almond dipped entirely in dark chocolate, these pale.<br /><br />If you can eat one single chocolate dipped almond, that would be fine and healthy.  These have fewer calories, and they just feel better for you, especially when you have a handful.<br /><br />Good enough so that I long to try the other flavors."
08	49053,B000EH4T5G,A3TMJRW4JM0T08,4/28/08,3,3,5,My dogs love it!,"I have a 6-month old Alaskan Malamute puppy and an elderly beagle.  I feed them both a combination of the Canidae canned food and the kibble. With the puppy especially and all the growing she's doing (she's already about 80 lbs. and will get up to about 135 lbs.), she is very healthy without any fat on her, has high energy and her coat is shiny and beautiful.  Both dogs love this food and I never have turned up noses like I sometimes do with other dog foods.  I also like the fact that the food is all made in America without fear of poisons from other countries."

I love almost any combination of fruit and chocolate and these sweet-but-tart little morsels are a superb example of how delicious that blend can be.  Walmart's price is currently the best by a large margin, so off I go to stock up on my latest confectionary addiction!"

The cocoa did not overwhelm the nuts and make them sweet, but rather added just a bit of background interest and flavor.  The almond taste still came through and continued to have the appropriate amount of saltiness.<br /><br />Although the taste was wonderful, you did have to get by the fact that they looked liked ""dirty nuts"".  Knowing what they were before you ate them helped.  I would not buy these on a day to day basis as they are fairly pricey. I do, however think they would be a hit if placed out on a party tray.  They were excellent with the red wine that we tried them with!"
08	44709,B001EQ55RW,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,6/1/08,1,2,4,Chocolate + almonds = A match made in heaven!,"Let me just out myself from the get-go here--I am a HUGE chocoholic.  I am also an almond lover and eat a small handful of dry roasted, unsalted almonds nearly every day.  So, when I saw dark chocolate cocoa-roasted almonds offered on amazon, it seemed a match made in heaven. :)<br /><br />What surprised me most, I think, about these delicious cocoa-roasted almonds is that they are not over sweet (only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving).  I worried that they would taste like candy and that is not something I need more of (I am already slave enough to the Sweet Monster!).<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise was that the almonds are not salty.  I have hypertension and need to limit my salt so, when the almonds arrived and I reviewed the nutrition label, I was pleased to see that they only have 25 mg of sodium per 1/4 cup serving and that they are made with dry-roasted vs. oil-roasted almonds.<br /><br />In my chocoholic fervor while ordering, I hadn't paid attention to what size cannister the almonds would come in, so I was again pleasantly surprised to find that they came in a generous 11 oz. cannister.<br /><br />I had some friends over last weekend and put out a dish of the almonds on the table.  I lost count of how many times I heard ""Mmm! These are GOOD!"" but I know that the dish was nearly empty when they left."
08	44710,B001EQ55RW,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,5/28/08,1,2,5,Nuts about 'em!,"I am not an almond lover, unless they are deep down inside an Almond Joy bar.  I like cashews, pecans, peanuts--but only the salted varieties. So when these little cocoa dusted beauties arrived yesterday, I was not expecting seduction. I tasted one, and it was good but elusive. So I had a couple. The chocolate taste is so light and tantalizing, it has a sort of cumulative effect, and after the fifth or sixth almond, I could have happily eaten the entire container. They are not very sweet and would make a perfect nibble to serve with dry sherry, if anyone still does that.  (I do, and you should, it's good).  Anyway, I was making a chicken salad for dinner (chunked up chicken, diced apple, green onion and curry dressing which is mayonnaise duded up with a little curry powder, some honey and lime juice).  I looked at the container of cocoa almonds and thought ""what the heck"" and flung in a big handful. It was the best chicken salad I've ever made. The barely sweet almonds and the barest ""what is that???"" hint of cocoa, along with the added crunch were knockouts.  Tonight I'm thinking about crushing them and tossing them on top of a microwave baked sweetpotato.  Unless I eat them all first.  Good stuff."
08	44711,B001EQ55RW,AQ24AUYTOL1EZ,5/27/08,1,2,3,A little too much,"Let me start off by saying that I love seeds and nuts. I've never been overly picky about which kinds. Peanuts and almonds being the two front runners. I try to get lots of proteins and aminos daily and you can't find a better healthier source.<br /><br />The idea of not increasing the calories or fat yet giving a hint of chocolate sounded cool. I like the taste of natural almonds and found Emerald Cocoa Roasted Almonds to be a bit too much for me. I can always tell a good nut by the ""can I stop eating"" factor. I found it very easy to get away from these almonds and didn't find myself craving them at all like I do most seeds/nuts.<br /><br />I'd be willing to try another flavor, but for the time being its natural (no salt) for me."

If you think a six pack is too much, by all means share them with friends & family.

I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic."

Made mostly of fruit and nuts, Larabar products do not hide the fact that natural ingredients have calories and fat.  But can they be part of a healthy diet? Definitely. Taste is subjective - I myself happen to enjoy the flavor, but none of Larabar's products are going to taste like a Milky Way. When you're tempted to go for the really bad stuff, it's nice to have these around, but it helps if you like the taste of the natural ingredients."

The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries. The almonds are chopped pretty finely, but still give the bar a bit of crunchiness. I love the taste, but if you're looking for something sweet, you might be disappointed. Each bar has 190 calories and 80 of them are from fat."
08	69290,B0018KR8V0,AD24OMGURWPTN,4/27/08,2,2,4,Tastes good,This bar is good. It tastes like eating a banana mixed in with some nuts. I like that it doesn't have any sugar added and it just uses the natural sugars from the banana to flavor the bar.

It is funny when I tasted the drink I thought, yup, that tastes like a Clementine.  Then I looked at the back for the ingredients.  There are juices (from concentrate) from White Grape, Apple, Lemon and Orange Juice.  No Clementine.  Funny enough it really is a nice flavor.<br /><br />Izze also offers this beverage in a just over 8 oz. a can.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />This is not a hydration beverage as much as a tasty treat.  It is not unhealthy so you don't need to feel guilty by downing one or two of these in a day.  Not calorie free but not too bad either.  The taste is not overly sweet.  I have heard from others who consider it bitter.  I disagree.  I think this bitter taste is from tastebuds too used to sugary sodas.<br /><br />A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book"

No high fructose corn syrup, or weird chemical additives derived from petrol products, and definately nothing synthetic!  Nature at it's finest!  If you have kids, they will adore these and won't even know THEY ARE HEALTHY FOR THEM!  I have yet to meet a flavor that I don't like!  Anyone who gives these a bad review either haven't tried them or they wanted them to be a Snickers bar. (I still feel these kick the pants off ALL candybars-but that's just my humble opinion.)"

I ran out and they ran out of the packets here on Amazon, so I gave this a try and I will  have to wait on getting the packets in the box, for this runs out much to fast and you find yourself using more than a teaspoon. I still like Equal, just not the powder spoonfuls."

I tasted it cold (got on my fingers while pushing it from the can) and found it very tasty and reminded me of pumpkin. It is supposed to be heated and was very easily done in my microwave. We both liked it heated but I still like it better cold. If you like something sweet, you have to give this a try!"

The lemon is my current favorite, but I have tried several of the others and find them equally satisfying.<br />These food bars are low in calories, high in nutrition, handy snack size and perfect for any folks with certain dietary limitations. Unfortunately,I have many food allergies found in MOST of the commercial snacks on the market, so these are very welcome to me.<br />Check the ingredient panel and be pleasantly surprised!"

They are a huge hit with my mom (the health nut) and my sister, who like me, is a college student. I love the ingredients list on every larabar ... only fruits, nuts, and sometimes a few spices, and more importantly, no corn syrups, sugar, synthetic fats, etc. I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs a nutritious snack, a balanced meal replacement, or brain food during a study break."

Overall, a very pleasing experience for my taste buds - all while nourishing my body, as well!<br /><br />Do not let some of the nutritional information (i.e. the fat and sugar contents) scare you - pistachios are an excellent source of protein, Vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, and zinc; the cashews contribute iron and zinc as well, plus heart-healthy oils and Vitamin B6. In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well. Even though the bar is only 51 grams, it is VERY satisfying and filling.<br /><br />Everything in this bar occurs naturally - no chemicals, artificial ingredients, or trans-fats here! In fact, the bar contains just three ingredients: dates, pistachios, and cashews - no dictionary needed to figure out its contents, that's for sure.<br /><br />When I received my package of the Pistachio Larabars from Amazon, the box was in great condition, and none of the bars (at least, the ones I have eaten so far; and I eat one almost everyday) have been rancid. Overall, this product (and other Larabar flavors, as well) is HIGHLY recommended, on my part."

It is all natural with no preservatives. you cannot make a better tasting, better for you bar. I eat these on my long runs on the weekends and they seem to sustain my energy very well.

08	7301,B0000V1B4I,A2D37TPGMT91GQ,11/23/08,1,1,4,Almost perfect!,"This is a dual review, as it has to be.  The first part covers the delicious, needs-nothing-else China Mist iced tea varieties included in this box.  Each of 24 packets contains four ounces of the world's choicest tea leaves, with stellar flavorings mixed in (dried, crushed mango; dried, crushed passion fruit; dried, crushed raspberry; pure, strong tea).<br /><br />My first experience with it was at a restaurant where our daughter works.  She said, Order the iced tea, Dad, you won't need to put any sugar or lemon or anything into it (always looking out for my diabetes).  It was fantastic, nearly the highlight of my meal, which itself was outstanding.  I asked the manager if he could share the tea secret:  Well, we use the industry's best, China Mist!  Everybody says it's the best they've had!  Indeed.<br /><br />The flavor was, if you'll pardon me, complex and could be rated as you would a nice wine--action, hints of this or that, a new rush at the end of your taste cycle.  It made me think what I'd been missing; this tasted like what the British must drink, the full-bodied teas they enjoy.  Apparently Americans add as much extra water to our tea as we do to our coffee (What the French hear when we order a java over there:  I'll have coffee, with a cup of water on top).<br /><br />The second part of the review concerns our Hamilton Beach iced tea machine.  We add the recommend water and ice cubes, and the brewing cycle indeed does take only 10 minutes.  The tea is already ice cold.  It may be the difference between a home-level heat limit, or maybe the fact that the water is not ""pressured"" over the tea as much as it might be in a commercial machine, or maybe the commercial machines are much better insulated around the steeping container.  Our Hamilton Beach unit made a weaker tea than I would have liked; we'll reduce the amount of water from now on and see what that does.  In fairness, the Bamilton Beach Iced Tea make was $22.49; commercial models are $600 or more, but they brew their stronger teas in only 8 (versus 10) minutes.  A wildly expensive two minutes."
08	44712,B001EQ55RW,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,5/19/08,2,4,5,The Subtle and Sophisticated Chocolate Almond,"This most unusual dry roasted almond from Emerald is lightly coated with dark cocoa powder, slightly salty and slightly sweet, and utterly delectable. This is a scrumptious crunchy snack that can also be reasoned as being healthy, since it has dietary essentials like protein and fiber, and therefore good for the body, as well as the emotions, that desperately need some chocolate now and then!<br /><br />The container information estimates that a serving is 1 oz. (about _ cup), which is actually quite a lot, and it's listed as 150 calories. Chances are though, that you won't stop at 1 oz. with these delicious little morsels in front of you. As a party snack, Cocoa Roast Almonds are a super hit. Although it seems that the cocoa is like a dusting over each nut, they don't leave your hands a terrible mess. Cocoa Roast Almonds make a terrific combo with your favorite beverage as a dessert, and they are also a nifty ""on the go"" breakfast.  The chocolate nutty aroma is wonderful, and the lightweight container is shaped to fit the palm of your hand. Good job Emerald on this excellent product!"

They're probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just can't get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce.

The China Mist brand is good, the only downside is some of the tea is pulverized too fine, so there is sediment in the tea. I recommend letting the tea settle before serving. China Mist is not extremely high-quality, just a nice every-day tea that tastes fine. The sample pack gives you a chance to try some variety, and it lasts a while."

I emailed them and they confirmed that their product is indeed produced in China. Having traveled in China, and, based on recent problems related to products made in China, I am no longer buying Mrs. Mays. How anyrhinf grown there could be described as ""organic"" strikes me as disingenous at best. The energy required to ship the product back to the US also strikes me as wasteful.

I wasn't certain how good it was going to be but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.  The powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste.  I was so impressed that I have signed up for automatic delivery.  It's a great product.
08	49073,B000TMKST2,AL5RWHUAFX2XC,11/24/08,10,11,5,rose cordial,I mixed this with equal parts 80 proof vodka and made a nice rose cordial for all you SCA folks out there.  Impress your friends with none of the hard work.  Enjoy.
08	37391,B00019DOPI,A3ASNGVW7AUGPH,1/28/08,4,4,4,Good Swiss at a great price,"Swiss cheese received in great condition.  This was wheel advertised at 4 - 5 lbs.  Ours was 4 1/2 lbs.  It is not typical swiss in that it has very samll ""holes"" and a soft texture.  Flavor is excellent.  We will order this again."
08	28427,B0016FRI8A,A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR,10/27/08,6,6,4,nice substitute for soda or sugary tea,"I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
08	37392,B00019DOPI,A34JGZ0CO4Y3TQ,12/3/08,1,1,1,maddie,"Very dissapointed.  Was expecting a large wheel of cheese.  What I got was approximately 1 LB of swiss cheese, 1 LB of cheddar cheese and 6 LBS of BUTTER!  How awful this would have been if this order had been a gift.  Will never order from this sellar again, and never order any food from Amazon again."
08	69820,B000W4U87E,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,8/19/08,0,1,5,Exactly as pictured,It is an accurate 8 ounce bottle of green and clear coarse sugar. The only downside is there is no sprinkler top. I used an old plastic spice container that had adequately large holes to accommodate the large crystals. I thought it was a great bargain at $1.58 and ordered another before the price went up to use for the upcoming holidays.
08	37393,B000FA15IG,A1XSNFR3U51S7B,1/6/08,2,2,4,Great for low-sodium diets,"Anyone who is trying to follow a low sodium diet knows it can be a challenge to find products that meet these requirements.  Since low sodium Wheat Thins are not easily found on the shelves, buying them through Amazon is a quick and reliable way to have them delivered to your door.  No need to do without if you like Wheat Thins but can't have the salt.  UPDATE:  Looks like I bought the last 6 boxes.  Come on folks, they didn't stop making them.  Let's get them back in stock."

08	49075,B000TMKST2,AZH6WYYPINUKD,7/19/08,2,2,5,delicious & unusual punch ingredient,"I'm in a dinner club with some friends once a month. When I was the hostest I had a spa themed dinner with a raspberry & rose petal punch.(Epicurious.com) The recipe called for a rose petal syrup, I found it on Amazon.com & ordered it. It smells just like roses & gave my punch a nice sweet flavor. Everyone loved it!!!"

08	69806,B000RHVG0O,A1JRIB8RLJS01V,3/6/08,1,1,3,so-so seed,"The question is ""what I would have liked to have known before I bought?"".<br />The answer would be what shape the seed was in...so in answer to that:<br />The seeds were not mildewey or moldy, you can use them, but they do<br />have abit of mustard seed (little black poppy looking seeds) and<br />a little tiny bit of seed refuse little tiny sticks and the such.  Not especially the best flax but certainly not the worse and the price really wasn't that bad. I will use in baking but not too keen on just eating it<br />straight, won't hurt you, just a personal thing."
08	19169,B001E5E20O,AQRN2I355LZ3F,10/24/08,6,7,3,Bold indeed !,"The product is described as ""bold"" and that is accurate. We found that the high level of bergamot oil overwhelmed the flavor of the tea rather than enhancing it as other Earl Grey's we've tried. We are blending it with other teas to produce the milder bergamot we prefer."
08	23321,B001E96JY2,AHQRU3MRORIWQ,11/18/08,2,4,3,Its OK,Taste and texture are OK. Prep is a little complicated. Lots of packaging that is apparently not recyclable... These are good for variety or to keep around 'just in case'.
08	28426,B0016FRI8A,A1OAZUFZTEEUEC,10/2/08,9,9,5,great alternative to bottled green tea,"The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is."

Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies."
08	704,B000G6MBX2,A2U3DAB0WI8BLZ,12/29/08,0,0,5,Kettle Organic Chipotle potato chips,The best potato chips I've ever had at the best price I've ever paid. The service was respectable and the shipping free.
08	705,B000G6MBX2,A3SV6IWK26XK6B,8/30/08,0,0,5,Best kept secret.,I love this product.  All of the different flavors are fantastic.  My family likes the 3 grain the best.  No more corn tortilla chips in this house!

08	79974,B001DIKWQK,A2PHK05U3YRGS2,9/8/08,1,1,5,Lifesavers!,"These puffets are so amazing!!!  I discovered them while visiting family in LA, where they are carried in Whole Foods.  My daughter isn't always the best eater and she loves these.  Now at 17 months old, every time I open the freezer, she runs over and looks for the box.  If it's on a lower shelf, she yanks it out and shakes it at me, begging for me to zap one up.  They are also great for traveling.  I always pack a couple for those long flights when she won't eat anything else.  Still hoping that they get distribution in NY state Whole Foods, but I will gladly order from Amazon until then."
08	2329,B000E5C1YE,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,6/6/08,2,3,4,Classic Candy,Sweetarts evokes nostalgic memories of going into the candy store and pining for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy.  While it's a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste.  You really can't go wrong with this candy.  The only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it you've eaten an entire roll.
08	69395,B000LPNXQW,A2V94LHIDO1T99,9/6/08,7,8,4,Tuna Belly,"We had it on bibb lettuce with grape cherry tomatoes. It needed no sauce or adornment. I had seen a recipe that had called for it. It was good, but I don't think that we were any more enthralled with it than we would have been with an Italian tuna packed in olive oil. This would have been close to 1/3 the price of the belly tuna. It was a noble experiment but we woldn't be likely to do it again."

The dogs like the crunch - it's shaped like a small square crouton. There is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs.
08	37422,B000FBO9LK,A2X8E6DT9YIZS6,12/23/08,1,1,5,die nuss ist los,"Have always enjoyed Balsen products. Found  the nuss-dessert cookies while on vacation at Sanibel Island Florida. We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).<br />So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now)."
08	37423,B000FBO9LK,A2PTYCTQMJYDYW,12/5/08,1,1,5,Best Cookie in the World,This is without a doubt the most incredibly addictive packaged cookie in the world. The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself. Why did I ever buy a whole case! Bless Amazon for carrying the Bahlsen line of fabulous cookies because it is not available in Montana.

We are both satisfied with these cookies.<br />Would buy them again and again.<br /><br />Mary"

If you enjoy Earl Grey tea - this one will knock your socks off!<br /><br />The fragrance will start you salivating - or running from the room, if, like my husband, you do NOT care for this flavor/scent!  Once I popped open the well-sealed tin, I knew I was going to like this tea.<br /><br />I use a French press to make my tea, followed the excellent instructions on the tin, and sat down to sip my way through my first cup - then another - yes, the leaves are ""re-usable"" for a couple of cups at least.  It makes the higher price tag a little more palatable - but keep in mind this is organic and fair trade too, which always adds a little to the price tag.<br /><br />It's tea that tastes great and that you can feel good about drinking.  It's now on my ""must have"" list!"

It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly."

There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.

When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it."
08	69731,B003CK7O36,AK7UAWHWHLP45,3/20/08,1,1,5,LOVED IT!,I have always loved chai tea but wanted more spice so I always brewed it really strong. This tea is just right and I'm very happy with it.

The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just ""scented"" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash ""double bergamot"" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both."
08	85796,B0018OL46G,A2PW5XDAP9247R,5/31/08,1,3,1,Deadly treat,I bought these at a local store. I broke up the first one for smaller training treats. My finger was stabbed by a needle shaped fish bone. This bone could have easily perforated my dogs digestive tract and made him very ill or dead. I have contacted the manufacturer and have yet to receive a response.

When the frostings came out I was excited to have a convenient source of frosting in a pinch.  The directions were easy, the prep a breeze but the final product fell short.  The frosting was too sweet with an overpowering vanilla taste-and I love vanilla. I would have to say the vanilla tasted artificial since it was so strong. I make a beautiful vanilla buttercream and although I did not expect a final product of this caliber, I expected better than what I tasted. Skip this product and take a few extra minutes to make your own."

Will buy more of these delicious Crunchies brand snacks!"

It helps to hold our constitution together and provides structure, fluid balance, endurance and strength. It is the slow, stable, calming, sweet and cold aspect of the self and governs our resistance to disease and promotes self healing.<br /><br />An imbalance in kapha leads to respiratory illnesses, excess cough/cold symptoms, weight gain, general feeling of laziness/heaviness.<br /><br />Kapha tea is an excellent antidote to a kapha imbalance - the tea itself is spicy and invigorating with strong notes of cardamom, ginger followed by cinnamon and lemon verbena.  It's spicy, complex and my new favorite!  I ordered a bodum tea press so I can brew this tea at work."

However, the taste is dry and bitter, not the kind of ""cocoa"" flavor you might expect if you're a fan of most dark chocolate products. Because I didn't enjoy the taste, I couldn't fill up on this snack, so I invariably munched on something else afterwards ... defeating the purpose of this snack."

It is not over powerful, just right. The tea itself is not strong so if you like very strong tea by all means add a bag of regular black tea to brew along with the Stash. Absolutely delicious..It will bring you to an exotic and distant land of pure enchantment."

Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad."
08	31469,B001E5DXEU,A10H9YHI0U1N7M,7/27/08,0,0,5,Great Alternative to Homemade,So it's Chai.  If you don't know Chai is a spiced tea.  In this case the overtone is vanilla.  It's got a little of everything you might get in pumpkin pie spice.  It's very tasty.  I use two scoops in a twice as large glass and I make it just with hot water.  You don't need to add milk.  Many of the local coffee bars actually use this brand.  You could of course make this whole thing yourself but this is a GREAT alternative. And of course Amazon is a great place to get it.  I actually love that they kind of remind me every couple of months to get more because I usually need it.

They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!"

But I received a sample of this in one of my Adagio orders, and I liked it.  I liked it enough to buy it.  This rooibos has a strong, true caramel flavor, which I loved.  This is the product that showed me I liked Caramel flavored teas.  Overall, this is a good beverage for the evenings, as it is caffeine free, and those who are fond of rooibos shous definitely give it a try."

The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!"

I use ice and skim milk and this powder.  This brand is great, and you definitely get the most for your money.  I used to get Vanilla Chai freezes at Borders for like 3-4 dollars, Starbucks makes frozen Chai's for just under 5.  I've also tried Tastefully Simple Chai, but it was really really expensive.  It's nice to be able to make it at home whenever I want (which is basically every day!) and it's more cost effective."

Nuts are a good source of protein and Vitamin E, but these were a little too calorie laden for me to eat a lot of.  They tasted good and the cocoa made a nice addition to the taste of the almonds.  I felt they would have been good crushed on top of ice cream or into a brownie mix.  Unfortunately, they are ALL GONE. My husband and son are extremely busy and need energy on the run; good snack items are eaten up very quickly.  We received our Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds on Thursday and the container was empty last night.  Sigh."

I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended."

And they ALL love them. But I made a number of adjustments to the mix instructions to make them great.<br /><br />The instructions call for 1/2 cup (or 8 tablespoons) Margarine (cold) which gives you a mix that is the texture of wet sand, not so good for cookies. And a pain to pat and form into something that looks like a cookie but keeps falling apart.  I almost double the margarine, I put 13-14 tablespoons of margarine. More or less depending on how the dough looks.  This gives you a cookie dough texture that is just right for scooping.  I also add a shake or two of cinnamon (chocolate and cinnamon YUM!), a teaspoon of vanilla, more chocolate chips (I like the enjoy life, soy free, dairy free ones) and walnuts or pecans (optional).<br /><br />Now here's another very important new step.  I make the dough and then I wrap it in parchment paper/plastic baggie and leave it in the fridge for at least 5 hours of even overnight, or freeze it for another time.  Somehow this step really makes a difference in taste and texture of the baked cookie.  Then scoop it up and bake as normal.<br /><br />I know it seems like a lot extra to do but when you have to stay GF in a G world you find ways to make things work.  I make adjustments to just about all the mixes I buy. And these cookies (with my tweaks) have a great, look, taste and texture."

But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12."

The pasta is easy to make, just brown the ground beef, dump everything into a pot, boil, cover, and simmer undisturbed while you go do something more useful than standing at the stove.<br /><br />The stroganoff is thick, creamy, and yet relatively `light' tasting - 1 cup of prepared stroganoff is approximately 0.5 grams of fat, according to the nutrition facts on the box. I always cut back on the meat - it calls for a pound of meat, but half or even a third of a pound is plenty for me. I use organic whole milk and unsalted butter and the result is a creamy deliciousness that I don't feel too terribly guilty about. I think the result would even be good without meat - for the vegetarians out there - if you wanted to experiment.<br /><br />I'm really pleased to be able to order this on Amazon - the bulk ordering is cheaper and I don't have to lug it home from the store, which saves gasoline money. The boxes come tightly packaged in the box to prevent spillage, and the expiration dates on the boxes aren't too close - the last order I received in September, with a ""best if used by"" date of the upcoming January. Although, really, I don't think Hamburger Helper is terribly perishable.<br /><br />This product, according to the ingredients list, contains wheat, milk, soy, and egg products, in case you might be allergic.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"

I'm pretty sure you can get the same taste if you just lick an almond and dip it in chocolate coco mix.  Plus I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate so that didn't help.  But after having a few, I couldn't stop.  Finally, my wife had to take them away, insisting that she would be using them in some future culinary masterpiece.<br /><br />Conclusion: Almonds are good.<br /><br />I think even if you washed off the chocolate these things would be addictive.

The only thing I can liken it to is metal-like.  I will say that after baking, some of the taste went away, and the crispier the cookies were, the better they tasted.  Too bad we like chewy cookies in our house. On a second attempt, I added more chocolate chips,and some cinnamon, they were better."
08	69532,B000EDBQ4M,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,1/11/08,0,0,3,Not So Great for Other Types of Restricted Diets,"Honestly, I'm more than a little surprised by other reviewers who say these cookies taste ""just like regular"" chocolate chip cookies. I don't know what cookies they were eating before but these in NO WAY taste or look like the homemade ones I make, nor did I expect them to.<br /><br />They are very easy to mix up but the dough is odd both in taste and in texture. After mixing, it appears quite crumbly but if you smoosh it together it will form a ball and then can be placed on cookie sheets. The taste of the dough has this....well, quite frankly yucky after-taste but thankfully that mostly goes away after they are baked.<br /><br />I got these mixes for my husband who was diagnosed with type II diabetes because some of the other gluten free products we'd tried were diabetic friendly but after reading the label found that not to be the case. In fact, if you are on any other kind of restricted diet, you should read the label before buying. Per every 2 cookies there is 180mg of sodium, 24g of sugar and 41g of carbs. Had I seen the label prior to buying, I would have passed. My bad.<br /><br />Bottom line: If I were gluten sensitive/intolerant, I would be thanking the God's above for these but since I'm not, I can't really say they are as good as regular cookies and if like me, you are thinking these will fill the bill as a healthier alternative if you are on a restricted diet of some other kind then the answer to that is no and they don't claim to be. I just want to save someone else from making the same assumptions I misguidedly made and is in NO WAY the fault of the maker but just my own mistake.<br /><br />I didn't give them 3 stars because they don't fit in with the diabetic diet but because they just didn't taste that good to me, my husband or either of my parents. Not horrible, just not what I would describe as ""tasty""."

This is the best Earl Grey because of the double Bergamot and we prefer it over any other Earl Grey. This is a full bodied, very flavorful tea and some dishwater blend. I hope Amazon will continue to carry it."
08	69605,B003CK7O36,A35PXDHHABYWR2,6/23/08,0,0,5,Unique Earl Grey,"I've tried a variety of Earl Grey blends, and this one wins the prize for being the most unique. The citrus flavor is noticeably different from other Earl Greys. The box says that in addition to bergamont, other citrus flavors have been added. Personally, I taste a touch of grapefruit in the mix, which makes this tea a bit more lively than your typical blend. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my goto is Bigelow's. I find Twinings to be too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."

I agree that it is not for the faint-hearted or those with a hypersensitive palate. Unlike teas such as jasmine green tea or chamomile which are soothing and relaxing, this tea is revitalizing and vivifying. So, if you want a bold and full flavored tea experience, this is the perfect tea for you."

The Bergamot is the reason I love this Earl Grey tea above all others.  I am giving this a good review before trying it because that's how much I love the Stash Premium Earl Grey.<br />I would recommend newbies to try the Premium first.  This is a winner among Earl Grey teas.  No one does it better than Stash.<br />I'm tempted to try their Chai Spice Tea.  Celestial Seasonings Vanilla Honey is my favorite.  If Stash makes it better I'm in heaven.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Didn't find a big difference between the Double and Premium Earl Grey.  Still love them.  Tried their Chai Spice--OK, but still love Celest. Seas. better."

The regular Earl Grey in this brand is also excellent, but the 'double bergamot' variety has a little more flavor than the Stash's regular Earl Grey.  I highly recommend both, and if you are curious like I was, treat yourself to one or both of these, and you will probably never want to purchase any other brand.<br /><br />I'm not sure the reason, but the other brands I've tried just do not taste as good.  Whatever Stash is doing with this tea recipe, it works."

After reading the reviews on Amazon, I ordered this vanilla chai from Big Train and absolutely love it.  It has a great flavor (not too spicy but just enough).  I highly recommend it for its flavor as well as it's price."

Obviously, I like gin and tonic so that's my issue but the oil of bergamot in this brews pungency might be a bit much for some. It certainly will keep the insects away too.<br /><br />But I like fragrant teas so I recommend this as an exhilarating Earl Grey as<br />the black tea base is superb as well."

I was a frequent fan of a certain book store that sounds like charms and local{hee hee} they use to serve there own brand of chai and then time stood still ... they stopped selling it. I called the store frantically to see if anyone could find some in a dusty old wharehouse in Cleveland...no really in Cleveland , Ohio that is where I discovered the yummy warm exotic substance.A very good sales rep informed me that Big Train Chai has the closest taste. So off in search of Big Train. I found it on Amazon and also at a wholesale club but I paid more at the wholesale club for just one can. On Amazon, I paid 19.99 for 2 cans AWESOME!! The flavor is creamy not like chai tea but like chai milk tea and it says to add one scoop per every 6 ounces but I use less for a larger cup. The warm cozy feeling I get is so pleasing it reminds me of the Big ""O""{wink, wink}try  a cup, warning chai tea may frequent gas for some, and the caffine levels are probably much lower than tea, chocolate and obviously coffee."

My five year old son says he wants me to put in the review that these cookies make ""super horrible cookies and dough"". I bake all the time and have made many gluten free desserts.  I like the Bob's Red Mill brownies but these cookies have a horrible aftertaste that does not go away after they are cooked as one reviewer stated. In fact, after making the first batch and reading the glowing reviews here I bought another bag and made them again because I figured I must have had a bad bag but the second bag was just as bad.  We threw the cookies and the rest of the dough away after tasting them. I made some other chocolate chip cookies with the Gluten Free Pantry all purpose flour (using a regular recipe)and they tasted much better."

All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.

I searched high and low, but was unable to find them until I saw them here. I immediately ordered a case. These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, you'll be hooked!"

However, the product description says ""99% caffeine-free"" and this simply can't be true. I ordered the single-serving packets of this product and the package clearly states the caffeine amount. Each serving actually contains 65mg of caffeine per serving. That's almost as much caffeine as a tall Starbucks espresso-based drink. Almost twice the amount of caffeine in a can of Coke!<br /><br />If you need the caffeine boost, enjoy! But if you're watching your caffeine intake for whatever reason, be aware!"
08	31492,B001E5DXEU,A30X750M8V1XXW,12/18/08,1,1,4,Great flavor and a great buy,You get to large cans of the powder. The flavor is rich and the best part is you can make it as sweet or as week as you like. One scoop per cup is usually plenty. I mix mine with a little milk to for a more creamy texture. I've tried a few other mixes and some have had a nasty smell and after taste. I used to buy the Target brand in the green can but they discontinued that and now make it in a silver can and its one of those fake chemical smelling and tasting mixes...YUK.<br /><br />The only complaint about this is that 25% of the can is empty so you really don't get a full can. Other than that the flavor is great. Very close to the Duncan Donuts kind.

Although I usually prefer milk chocolate rather than dark the dark chocolate covering of these dry roasted almonds compliment each other beautifully.  A handful of these staves off my late afternoon carving for a little something with only 150 calories and the health benefits of almonds.  I also discovered that they go well with an after dinner brandy.  These are definitely something that needs a permanent spot in the pantry.

Emerald's Cocoa Roasted Almonds (Dark Chocolate) are an excellent solution to this one drawback.  The chocoalte does not make your hands a mess and you stil get the great taste.<br /><br />One warning perhaps is that this resembles cocoa powder than the form of chocolate one normally gets in a candy bar or in chocolate coated nuts.  It has less of the sweetness than that and more of a bite.  Perhaps an acquired taste, it is none the less excellent and a real treat."

Now available from Amazon, it is VERY HARD to find any Earl Grey that is FRESHER, or of higher QUALITY. Peets in the a.m., and Dilmah Earl Grey in the p.m., for a refreshing LIFT, that coffee just can't match - weird, but true.

Each canister has a double lid plus comes sealed in plastic to preserve the flavor. On opening the lid, the rush of bergamot aroma hits your nose. Wow! You also smell the flavor of the black tea (unlike some other Earl Grey brands where all you get is the bergamot). The leaves are indeed the prized small buds from the top of the plant.<br /><br />This tea cannot be over-brewed. I left it longer than 5 minutes a couple of times and it never became bitter or acidic. Always you taste the smooth black tea and the bergamot is strong but never over-powering.<br /><br />I also like that you're supporting a local grower and the workers instead of being syphoned off into a large mega-corporation.<br /><br />If you like Earl Grey, get this tea!

This works just as well!<br /><br />Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.

I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.<br />The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy."

The almonds are great (and no one does them better than Emerald), but instead of being ""covered"" in milk chocolate......these are ""dusted"" in a dark chocolate. The result is that they're just right:  not too sweet and the chocolate doesn't overpower the almond.<br /><br />The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is the addition of sucralose in the product.  I'm not sure what the best solution would have been for a sweetener but I don't generally choose to use sucralose.  Other than that, it's a perfect snack!"

Very strong with a bit of an edge, quite suitable for Star ship Captains, gentleman adventurers and  with a little extra water the rest of us too. I like it better sweetened than unsweetened and think it needs sugar and/or milk to smooth it out. The Bergamont flavoring is a bit strong in my opinion but if you like an intense Earl Grey version, this might be just your cup of tea ( I had to say that).<br />There is quite a bit of caffeine in it so it might not be the best bedtime beverage. This tea Goes well with classic tea accompaniments such as cookies, cakes, cucumber and ham finger sandwiches etc. and would also be good to accompany a meal.  Not really the tea you would choose to serve with sushi except for that style of California Roll  that is made with chopped crab (or Kreb surimi) and Mayonnaise, Which was really enhanced when served with this tea."

Instead of being coated in a ""skin"" of chocolate, the nuts are roasted in what appears to be cocoa powder; the result is a mixed bag.<br /><br />Although there's a definite hint of chocolate flavor, it's not very strong, and if you're looking for a chocolate-y treat, you'll probably be disappointed. However, if what you want are almonds with a twist, then you'll likely be delighted with Emerald's latest  product."

The texture is nice--you have real chewability here. Not mush. Real bite. And the sweetness is great for adults--not cloying, unlike cereals would appeal more to kids.<br /><br />The size is quite generous. In fact, I wish it was a bit smaller size, honestly. It's 300 calories for the whole cup (8 grams of fiber total). I find that I eat 2/3 of it and am fine. Besides, I like a variety type breakfast (ie, eggs with toast and juice, oatmeal and an egg white scramble with veggies, etc). I don't just like ONE thing (ie, oatmeal or just toast or just eggs).

No constipation since and he has been on this formula for about 2 weeks. I give him some prune/cereal every 4 days.

And that might be your second impression, too.<br /><br />However, once you put a few miles between yourself and the typical ""goo and glue"" diet, you may grow to like these rice cakes. The caramel flavor is my favorite, but the apple cinnamon isn't too bad either. They're good snacks and they're fairly healthy and they're good for your body and digestive system.<br /><br />To my horror, I see that they're sweetened with high fructose corn-syrup which is mighty disappointing. I'd think that the demographic type that's interested in eating rice cakes is also going to be the demographic type that's sophisticated enough to read labels and sophisticated enough to know that HFCS is a dirty word and an unhealthy sweetener.<br /><br />I wish these mega-monster corporations would go back to SUGAR and just add the 1/10th of a penny cost to the retail price.

It allows you to infuse the aroma and part of the taste of the truffle. I purchased a finger sprayer and use it to allow the oil to create a mist over simple dishes like ravioli/butter/capers/procusitto and parmesan.<br /><br />Most cooks are unaware that the product (infused olive oil) even exists. Used in the fashion above it can be misted in many recipes to add an exquisite taste at a reasonable price.

One coworker -- I'm call her H -- described the snack as tasting like ""almond-flavored Cocoa Puffs."" Another coworker -- let's call him J -- said they took him back to his childhood by reminding him of Ovaltine without the milk. Most of my taste-testers concurred with H's description when they heard it.<br /><br />I have been finding these nuts to be a good afternoon snack. They're vaguely chocolately, but not in an overly rich way and not so much so as to make me feel like I'm indulging.<br /><br />If you avoid artificial sweeteners, take note: Sucralose is an ingredient.  Otherwise the ingredients are pretty natural: Dutch-processed cocoa, almonds, salt.<br /><br />So in short: if you like the flavor of Cocoa Puffs, and you think almond flavoring would improve them, and you like quasi-healthy snacking, and you don't mind artificial sweetener, these will probably be a favorite for you. Otherwise, plain roasted almonds may be a better alternative."

The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."

Although my recipe may not be the healthiest, it tastes great.  I have also tried the French Vanilla Total Soy as well, but we love chocolate too much to switch.<br /><br />Also with respect to the other brand mentioned, I had to use 3x as much cocoa to cover up the after taste.

Delicious!<br /><br />These almonds come in a neat plastic screw-top container in case you want to save some for later, but you'll find it hard to do so. Taste one and you can't stop.<br /><br />A great snack to keep near you while you read that book you can't put down. I recommend this one highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."

The fats in almonds are mostly good fats--90% unsaturated. Plus, almonds are decent sources of daily nutrients including, protein, fiber and vitamin E. (Source:  Natural News)<br /><br />Okay, I like almonds--but I love them dipped in chocolate.  That adds a LOT of extra sugar, fat, etc.<br /><br />Emerald has solved that problem with cocoa roasted almonds.  A 1 ounce serving of these almonds is 150 calories, which is the same as regular roasted almonds!  They have zero cholesterols, 3 grams of fiber, and only 1 gram of sugar.<br /><br />They're not 'sweet sweet'.  If you like dark chocolate bars with 70% or better cacao (the good stuff) you are going to LOVE these nuts.<br /><br />The cup-size container's a great size to pack in your car.  It'll fit in a cup holder--or you can sneak it in the movie theatre and have almonds instead of a fat- or sugar-laden snack.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, May 2008"

This is a very good brand to start off with and you're able to buy this brand pretty much anywhere luckily. I go back and forth between MudBay and Petsmart depending on price. Yes its a bit expensive but its very much worth the buy!

With that being said I consider myself lucky. Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.<br /><br />I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.<br /><br />Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...<br /><br />The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.<br /><br />I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try..."

Great flavor and texture.  Very easy to prepare and my selective 4 1/2 yr old ate it all up!  I just wish it had less sugar.  Given that any person who makes this cup will eat it all most likely and thus has 2 servings or 18grams of sugar!  Way too much, I wish this was available in a lite sugar version.  I will have this for the kids once in a while since it is very flavorful and they eat it.  But I try not to serve that much sugar.  Whole grains are important to our bodies health, but having too much sugar is as bad as not having the whole grain.  Be sure to add an extra 20 minutes to your run time each day and you can enjoy these cups without worry!"

However, if you love almonds and the health benefits they have, but are on a low-carb diet, you might want to give these a try. I love chocolate, but try to stick with high-protein, low-carb snacks and I really enjoyed these cocoa roast almonds. They have just a hint of chocolate, so it's not going to satisfy a serious chocolate craving, but I really enjoyed it over typical roasted almonds, and was happy to have some chocolate flavor without having to feel guilty about the carbs that usually come with it. The powdery covering does not come off much on your fingers and while it does use Splenda, I could not detect it at all while eating them. I don't eat a lot at one sitting, so a single container lasts me a couple weeks. I definitely will be purchasing these again!"

I've never had Rishi's Earl Grey, and now I'm asking where has it been all my life? This is one of the very best Earl Grey teas I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. It comes in a lovely container, and upon opening it, there is a wonderful fragrance of tea and orange bergamont. The quality of this tea is outstanding, and it makes a very invigorating cup of tea. I used one tablespoon and steeped it in boiling hot water for five minutes. I like my Earl Grey with a little milk and organic stevia (a natural sweetener), and honestly, I was in heaven sipping this. There are a lot of mediocre Earl Grey teas out there, but this one is truly top shelf. Don't hesitate to purchase this if you're a fan of this intoxicating tea!"

It starts by being double sealed to retain freshness and aroma and doesn't stop there.  It is a premium black tea with just the right mix of bergamot for a crisp, citrus note.  I have had Earl Grey's that overuse the bergamot to hide a less than sterling low note of underpar black tea to try and carry the flavor.  RISHI does it right.  You can have a taste and aroma experience, perfectly balanced to deliver maximum satisfaction.  I normally like a little raw sugar or honey in my tea, but this beautiful blend can stand on its own.  Nothing needed here but boiling water and a short wait to enjoy an excellent tea experience.  Well done RISHI!"

Amazon quickly replaced the order but in the replacement case 9 cans were dented. That is really unacceptable. They did refund my $ but I really want the pumpkin so I am going to try one more time and order it again and see if I can get a case of undented cans.

We are so much used to the taste of chocolate (which is actually cocoa + many other ingredients like milk ...) - that you might have never really tasted really cocoa.<br /><br />Tasting this item it like tasting and enjoying flavorful pure raw cocoa with crunchy almonds in the center.  Get yourself a box and see for yourself what real cocoa + almonds is !<br /><br />Where this product loses a star is in its packaging - the external sleeve is kind of comes in one piece, so if you try to remove the lid, the external sleeve kind of tends to come off fully - so careful when you are removing the external sleeve for the canister."
08	19235,B001E5E20O,A2I5LVVQ7WXEH6,10/22/08,0,0,5,What a great aroma in the tin and wonderful flavor in the cup!,"Reading the label was an experience in its self.  Great information about the location of the tea trees and the culture around their 1600 year existence.  The tea leaves are appealing to the eye and the hand.  The aroma of the bergamot is strong yet light with a apple, citrus blend that feels like it would be good in any season of the year.  The Earl Grey tea when brewed is quite nice with good strong flavor and the aroma of the bergamot remains for us to enjoy a little longer.  Since bergamot oils have been used to help with stuffy noses and other medicinal purposes, this will work well in Southern California in the Spring and Fall with the Santa Ana Winds that cause so much havoc with our sinuses.  Then, again, in the Winter with flu and colds.<br />The tin has two lids to help keep the freshness in.  The inner lid seems to have more that one job; first is to help you not spill the loose tea everywhere when opening the outside lid.  Then it looks like it might be a measuring cup for use of a 11 ounce mug.  So I tried it and it seemed just right or slightly stronger than I'd like but drank it anyway and felt rejuvenated each afternoon.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed the bold and smooth flavor of this tea and will look forward to trying other blends in the Rishi Tea line of products."

I am already a big fan of Earl Grey teas, and this one did not disappoint.  It is very full-flavored, with a lovely note of bergamot, as one would expect from the best Earl Grey blends.  Enjoy it hot or cold, and do try it without sugar or honey first - it really doesn't need it.  I recommend this product!"

This is definitely the best organic Earl Grey I've tasted."

I ordered two boxes. One for me and another for my friend. Well, I would just like to say that this was the worst experience I ever had with an online order. I ordered two boxes of this tea and only received one. Then I got one box of the tea, me thinking this is weired. I sent an email to the company. I had to wait at least 2 1/2 weeks to get a response from my email. Granted, the owner emailed me back and said he was out of the country and did apologize. His wife was helping him. The thing is, if the help is not good or don't know what they are doing. It is like leaving your business on auto pilot and hoping nothing goes wrong! Well it did, things went terribly wrong! I did not even try the tea. The box I did get I just put it to the side. The owner did refund my money for the one box I never got, I thank you for that to say the least. But over all next time please do not leave you business unmanned. The results are not good at all!"

It has a bit smoky and oily aftertase that is very mild and lingers for a while. A second brew is especially enjoyable. Plus it's USDA Organic and Fair Trade Certified. I like it more than Two Leaves And A Bud's Earl Grey. I highly recommend this tea!<br /><br />3.5 months later: I have finished a 3rd can of this delicious loose tea and am going to buy more!

For some reason they think they are strawberry bars.  I love the soft texture and the non crumbly state.  It makes for clean car rides.  Since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best.  Berry is always left for last.  Amazon has a wonderful price and I just wish it could be a subscribe item.

I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their ""original"" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more."

You only get one or two anchovies in each pack, but, truly, that should be enough for you.  It's like a super-salty prize in the Cracker Jack pack.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

So, when I got a chance to try these I jumped all over it right away.<br /><br />First off, the container is much bigger than I thought. There are a lot of nuts in one package. Secondly, unlike most chocolate covered nuts, these nuts are baked with the chocolate (not dipped). This dramatically cuts down on the mess.<br /><br />Flavor is very good. Normally I am not a very big fan of dark chocolate it always leaves an odd aftertaste in my mouth. Here, that wasn't the case. It was a perfect mix between tastingt he chocolate and tasting the nut and didn't  leave much (if any) of an after taste.<br /><br />Emerald nuts has always had high quality standards and this product is not any different. I enjoyed my can and will certainly be buying more in the future."
08	44743,B001EQ55RW,A2PZ5G9HR4U963,7/23/08,6,13,1,"An almond, ruined.","This product points to the trouble with modern food-processing: overkill. Do we need fake sugar? Or do we just need to consume (a lot) less of the real thing? I won't wax poetic on that point, except to say that these almonds are gross. They are artificially sweetened, the ""cocoa"" (it's hard to believe, after tasting these, that it's real) is repulsive and they have an aftertaste---like death. Really, hyperbole aside, these are disgusting."

It is wonderful to be used in animal diets.  I have been working with animals and it has been a life saver for many animals that I have helped<br />I believe that it would be unfair to fault the product or the manufacturer.  From what I understand from the UPS driver, it Amazon who is at fault for extremely  poor packaging practices.

08	44750,B001EQ55RW,AORGKBNQZ83O8,5/28/08,2,2,3,Weird,"I popped several of these into my mouth without reading the ingredients (which I thought were pretty well covered in the product description). They tasted good for a brief instant and got progressively worse as I chewed. For one thing, they're quite dry (if this review for some reason piques your desire to whip out your credit card, make sure you have mass quantities of liquid on hand--you'll need it). These are, in fact, the driest almonds I've ever eaten.<br />The Dutch-processed cocoa used tasted anemic (I grew up on Hershey's). Insult compounded injury in the form of a bizarre aftertaste. This prompted me to actually read the label...imagine my surprise at discovering that the nuts are sweetened by none other than Sucralose.<br />I don't like Sucralose. The feeling is apparently mutual: it gives me a headache.<br />2 oz. of Cocoa Roast Almonds (Emerald having eschewed the two-word modifier) provides 150 calories, 120 of which, despite their dryness, are from fat. It seems to me that those watching their weight and/or sugar intake could probably find a more enjoyable source of 150 calories."

Each almond is coated in a dark chocolate cocoa powder, and it really is a nice little treat, even though I normally don't go for almonds when sifting through a can of mixed nuts. I also tend to prefer a more traditional chocolate coating on nuts, but I'm still giving these 5 stars. While I probably wouldn't choose them over a bag of chocolate covered peanuts, these are a high-quality and highly enjoyable alternative that I kept popping into my mouth despite my usual aversion to almonds outside of an Almond Joy bar or bag of M&M's. You'll need a drink handy though. Almonds are dry little nuts, and since these employ a powder for their not very sweet cocoa flavoring, they're no exception. The container is very attractive, by the way, and my only complaint about it is that it does not close very securely. I mean, it's one of those lids you can turn easily past the tightening point. Still, a great product I highly recommend trying to anyone who loves the taste of cocoa and almonds.

(especially fond of smoked almonds) and I like chocolate.<br />However the combination of the dry cocoa powder, which is slightly bitter, and the dry unsalted taste of the almond doesn't really seem to work.<br />Frankly first impression is one of blandness.<br />Maybe because my palette leans toward the sweet side, these just seem bland.  The combination almost offsets the benefits of either taste.  It's just not a sweet taste, and that was what I expected."

I decided to give them Cosequin, a highly recommended supplement for joint health in cats and dogs.<br /><br />One of my cats is a pig and will eat anything that's not nailed down, so I knew giving him the supplement would be a fairly easy process; however, the other cat is very picky and will only eat dry food (he's not even interested in cat treats), so I was concerned that giving him the Cosequin would be an impossible task.<br /><br />Enter Greenies Pill Pockets (chicken flavored). Skittles (the finicky cat) went nuts the second I introduced them. I stuck a capsule inside a Pill Pocket and he snarfed it down at top speed, then started looking for more. And it's been that way ever since. For the first time ever, my cats actually look forward to getting their medication every day! (In fact, the other two cats who aren't receiving medication try to sneak a Pill Pocket every now and then.)<br /><br />The only thing I would caution is that the pockets are fairly small. Cosequin capsules, for example, can be opened and sprinkled on food or into a pocket -- but it took about three pockets to hold one capsule's worth of powder. Thus, I've had to keep the capsule intact, pushing it through the pocket so that it sticks out on both ends. That said, my cats still inhale it like it's the best thing they've ever tasted.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all cat families. This product works miracles."

There was no description on the product page but the price seemed to be right so I purchased a bag. The seller shipped it in a timely manner and when I got it, I opened it right away. My wife who was close by had to seat down because she could not breathe and it took us a while to figure out what it was. She is in good health and never had this problem before. We narrowed it down to the watermelon seeds. They are roasted and salted (therefore no good for a tea) and treated with some sort of very strong preservative that I suspect may be illegal in the US because we never encountered it before. I tried eating them out of a strange curiosity a few times, but I started coughing right away so they ended up in the garbage.<br />If you care about your health stay away from these seeds and/or any Ziyad foods for that matter."

One ounce is only 150 calories, with only one gram of saturated fats, making this a healthy alternative to standard chocolate treats.<br /><br />The taste? Pleasant enough, but lacking the inherent richness one commonly associates with the tasty combo of chocolate and nuts, replaced in its stead by the fairly dry, pasty sensation of dipping whole nuts into instant hot chocolate mix. This means that Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds is a fairly satisfying nut snack, even if it is rather lacking as a chocolate one.<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but best washed down with a cold, or hot, glass of milk."

Maybe your's got crushed by the post office. I dont know. All I know is that regardless of what it looks like out of the bag, you can still use it. It doesnt stick to your fingers, it doesnt require refridgeration and the dogs love then.  There is a difference in the consistancy of the dough between the beef and chicken however.

This is the stuff.  The Big Green Monster.<br /><br />As I write this I'm listening to DJ Splash and I'm about to start my second 16oz. can.  There was a time when I hated trance/dance music and didn't drink ""soda,""  but now the two seem like a marriage consecrated in the holiest of heavens.  By the way, it's only noon.<br /><br />My path to Monster Enlightenment was born out of my video game addiction.  Playing until 4am and getting to work by 7am was turning into a bit of a hassle.  Coffee can only do so much, and that's when I started to drink rocket fuel like a meth addict.  One can a day used to do the trick -- and best of all -- it satisfied my appetite too.  Who needs nourishment when you can get by on sugar and caffeine and a few vitamins sprinkled on top for fun?  I wasn't a tub before by any means, but I'm about 15 pounds lighter than last summer.<br /><br />But the days of single cans are in the past. I'm currently trying to ween myself of satan's nectar.  A 16oz can is around $2.35 at most stores, so if I have two a day it's pretty similar to if I had a moderate smoking habit.<br /><br />The withdrawl is pretty unpleasant, too. I'm not sure of the addictiveness of Taurine, but Caffeine isn't something to be scoffed at. Your body adapts to Monster's boost pretty quickly, and before too long your body expects it, longs for it.  It becomes harder to get through the day without it.  I have been known to drink it warm and/or flat.<br /><br />So why the five star rating?  Because this stuff is awesome and I love it.  I love it even though I'm probably going to end up with intestinal cancer because of it.  I also like the flavor the best out of all the energy drinks.<br /><br />Just be wary, drink it when you need it, not as a substitute for your regular drink.

Instead of struggling with her to get them down, she actually DROOLS when I get the pill pockets out. I do recommend giving your dog a couple of them without the pill beforehand, because my dog usually spits out any new treat the first time, sniffs it out, chews it, etc.  Now she just gobbles it up. They easily mold around the pill, and I do follow the directions (not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill).  Anyways, it's been a week, so hopefully the success will continue. GO PILL POCKETS! (lol)<br /><br />Edit: It's been 3 weeks, and still a success.  I don't even do the ""not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill"" thing anymore.

08	44759,B001EQ55RW,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,5/28/08,4,5,3,These Almonds Have Me Sitting On The Fence,"When I got my hands on these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, I thought that the concept was actually pretty good.  I had my doubts, though.  When I opened the container, there was a very, very light chocolate smell that was overwhelmed by the natural smell of the almonds.<br /><br />After trying a few of the almonds, I tasted only a slight hint of chocolate (especially in the aftertaste).  I tasted no salt whatsoever.  The almonds themselves had a rather bland taste to them.  Perhaps it was the mixing of the two flavors that negated both of them.  Mind you, there was nothing terrible about the taste.  It was just bland.<br /><br />The crunch factor was about the only redeeming quality of these almonds.  Dry roasting provided a very nice loud crunch.  The dark chocolate ""dust"" wasn't messy, but a tiny tad of it did get on my fingers.  It was easily washed off, however, and this really isn't a major concern for me.<br /><br />What has me fence-sitting, though, is the fact that when my wife came home later in the evening, she tried the almonds and fell in love with them.  I was fully prepared to give a two-star rating to these almonds until she gave them such glowing approval.  In the end, I guess that it all boils down to personal taste.  If you like very light and (at least to me) very bland chocolate and nutty tastes mixed together, get yourself some of these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds.  However, if you're taste buds lean heavier towards the chocolate end of the spectrum, stick with Goobers."

You have to be careful biting into them to prevent your entire taco from falling apart.

Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag.

I think it needs to be consumed for a longer period of time maybe 2 weeks or more in order to really feel results, but that's the basic principle when it comes to detoxing with any tea or diet foods.

Most of the time I am not impressed by these types of tea, but this time I was VERY surprised. The tea is very strong, the strawberry flavor is not a chemical tasting flavor, it tastes like real strawberry with a strong malty Assam black tea. In my opinion this is the result of perfectly blended tea, I don't like weak tea with weak flavor ""notes"" unless it is a complex white tea, this tea was strong, stands up to milk and plenty of sugar and still is the dominating flavor in your cup, a constant battle of the beautiful malty Assam and the sweet aroma and flavor of strawberries. I share a lot of teas with my friends that are top notch, some very expensive blends even, but this is the tea they ask for more often than not, lol. Which is good for me as it is so inexpensive and easy to make, you really can toss this in the microwave with a cup of water for 2 minutes!<br /><br />Give this one a try if you are looking for a strong flavored, strong black tea."

The first weeks I was only drinking in the morning after my workouts and it really helped boost my energy in the morning and was a great part of my morning breakfast. I also notice that my skin cleared up really nicely. I've never had problem skin but it is smoother now than ever before so I believe the detoxing benefits are kicking in. This last week, I've been drinking it after I get home from work, before dinner and I just can't seem to go a day without it. Very soothing and the taste isn't bad at all.  Would recommend it to everyone. I'm not a big tea drinking but I will buy this tea in bulk because it really makes a difference."

A case of Ginger Snaps and case of Chocolate Cookies from another manufacture.  Both cases arrived quickly from Amazon.

I don't usually like licorice but the other flavors blend well and I enjoy the slight bitterness of this tea.<br /><br />I also think it does help my body get rid of toxins.  I'm looking forward to trying some of the other teas in this line.

Just make sure you enjoy a mild licorice undertone. I do. But, my son does not like the flavor or the smell. If a very mild licorice flavor appeals to you, you should enjoy this tea."

I liked that it was ""healthy"" with the almonds. The chocolate coating was like a dusting of that you might use for cocoa, rather than the creamy chocolate of a candy bar.  It would be good for a light snack that also has some health benefits in case you're looking for that in a snack."

How did I know that? Well, half the container was mysteriously empty and the UPS guy JUST delivered them. After one bite of these delicious nuts, I solved the mystery. My husband was in his office just finishing off his last handful when I walked in and he yells ""THESE ARE ADDICTIVE, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE"". Right then and there I knew, I could only eat a few more or someone would have to call the show Intervention on me. I like almonds but these are exceptional with their slight, not overwhelming cocoa/chocolately taste. They taste  so good I just can't bring myself to buy anymore because one is just not enough. I HIGHLY recommend these in moderation otherwise, eat a whole container but then spend at least an entire week at the gym burning them off. Enjoy!!"

It shipped that very night and we had it within just a few days.<br /><br />This is our favorite chili. It's so easy to make and it doesn't take much time (about 30 to 40 minutes.) We seem to always have chicken or turkey, so we put pieces of either one in the chili and enjoy the chili with hot cornbread.<br /><br />The best part about the chili is it's not just plain old chili. It has a variety of beans as well as rice and some pepper which make the chili very tasty.<br /><br />This really is ""Darn Good Chili""!"

And these almonds DO have a chocolate flavor to them - no doubt about it.  Of course the do NOT have that nice, soft, creamy chocolate covering that melts in your mouth...  But then, the only reason you are even CONSIDERING these is because ... you are on a diet.  (sigh).<br /><br />Considering the diet restrictions, this product will give you the taste satisfaction of chocolate and nuts, but not all the satisfaction of sucking off the chocolate and then eating the nut.  Sorry about that, but that's the way it is.  But, you do get a very healthy snack, and if you are wanting something different, the strong hint of dark chocolate, you gotta try these!"
08	44782,B001EQ55RW,A3LYLRNW15DPU6,6/19/08,1,1,4,Pretty good,"I'd heard about these from a few people, but the price in the supermarket, generally about $6/jar, kept me from trying them.  These aren't too sweet and the chocolate flavor isn't overwhelming--think of a dark chocolate bar.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I found these pretty satisfying, but I'd keep these as an occasional treat only."

The taste is weaker and the color has changed from clear yellow to reddish. And the box has gone from this interesting, colorful carton with lovely sayings to a cheap, thin, unattractive box that screams ""Made in India as cheaply as possible."" I'm looking for another Detox tea. Why mess with a great product?"

I would order again."

It's a typical English Breakfast style tea flavor wise, somewhat malty, strong and darkish, and makes for a bracing cup of tea.  What I didn't like about it was how astringent it was, almost to the point of being bitter.  So, if you don't like teas that are strongly astringent (puckery dry mouth feeling like a cabernet or zinfandel wine) this is not the tea for you.  The Irish Breakfast and the Assam are much better in my opinion.  More malty, less astringent."

I was on antibiotics and a decongestant and was starting to feel better.  Then, when I drank this tea (one cup in 30 minutes), I felt worse and nauseated.  I don't know if it's the tea itself, or a reaction with the other things in my body, but I'm going to steer clear of this tea."

I can find myself eating maybe 10 of these cocoa roast ones at a time before closing the container.  Of course most nuts and chocolate go together very well but this was definitely a clever idea."
08	523,B000G6RYNE,A3MFU0GVZUVH3K,4/1/08,43,47,5,Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"

There's quite a kick to it that the hot/spicy intolerant may find difficult to stomach but that can easily be fixed since the seasoning package (hot) can be adjusted.  Finally, this is perfect for a snack since 2.6 oz isn't enough for a meal."

I made a couple of changes - because I love the flavor of tomatoes I decreased the water from 7 cups to 6 cups and added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes to the water.  I also added a can of black beans (drained)to it.  I was trying to keep the calories down so didn't add meat but imagine that would be good also.  Try it....

(Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again."
08	44785,B001EQ55RW,A1TKM36EYEQNSM,6/18/08,1,1,4,Nice Taste - lightly covered cocoa,I like the Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds.  They are still crunchy and have the light dusting of Cocoa so it is not too rich nor too light.  You still have the taste of the almonds as well.<br /><br />Nice snack if you just want a quick bite and on the run.  Get Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds.
08	41757,B0000D8DI0,A8DMQT6S54CZR,8/24/08,0,0,5,Very smooth with a little more sweetness than the 88%,This used to be my favorite dark chocolate until I discovered the 88% dark Hachez bars.  One reviewer thought it was crumbly but my guess is that they had something cold in their mouth before eating it - you don't want to do that with dark chocolate or it doesn't melt on the tongue very well. This company makes some very smooth but intense chocolate for those who don't like the bitterness or sourness of very dark chocolate.  I just came home from Germany and stocked up on Hachez at the duty free shop.  I wish I'd bought more.  This stuff is fantastic!
08	46758,B001EQ4SHK,AWJIDYMBMI55D,8/30/08,31,32,4,This blend is not the same as the Special Dark of a few years ago.,"Although this cocoa is called Special Dark, it isn't the same Special Dark cocoa of a few years ago.  The previous Special Dark was 100% Dutched Cocoa, while the current Special Dark is a blend of Dutched and Natural Cocoas, so it isn't as dark or as strong as the previous one.  It is very good and has a pleasant fruity taste as compared to the more bitter and richer cocoa taste of its predecessor.  Initially I preferred the previous Special Dark, but am getting used to the new blend. The price is very good."

The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education.-M.Twain,"I don't usually like plain almonds; when I eat almonds they are usually highly sugared, covered in cinnamon or gooey'd up in honey like the ones you can get warm at the mall.  When I saw this product, I thought it sounded yummy, so I thought I'd give them a try, turns out I was right.  They have just enough cocoa to satisfy my sweet tooth, but not too much that it covers up the flavor of the nut.  It's not as sweet or as sugared as those mall almonds, these have a more subtle taste.<br /><br />I have been trying to snack in between meals and found grabbing a small handful of these was both delicious and satisfying.  Even my husband and son enjoyed them.  I was pleasantly surprised with this product and can see me keeping these in my pantry for my little midnight snack attacks.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, June 2008"

I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.<br /><br />And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.

A little while back I tried making them with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and it really pushed my brownies to a decadent level.

I had tried Girardelli's powdered cocoa before and remember the first time I tried it as hot chocolate I thought to myself it's ok but nothing amazing so this time I bought the Hersheys.  The first thing I noticed is the almost black-gray color when you mix it into the hot milk with barely a trace of brown.  That didn't seem too appetizing but I prefer it to having artificial colors added.  From the first sip the taste was amazing!  One of those situations where you just can't put the cup down and keep taking small sips even though this liquid was steaming hot.  I made it with powdered milk (0 fat) raw sugar, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.  The dark chocolate taste is amazingly full and satisfying.  When I started to drink this I thought I might get a stomach-ache since it looked so dark but not at all (Used a very heaping teaspoon)"

These cocoa roast almonds preserve much of what I like about Emerald nuts - freshness, not too much oil, high quality - but are more of a semi-sweet snack instead of a salty one.<br /><br />Their sweetness doesn't come from sugar, though. They are sweetened lightly with sucralose (the sweetener sold under the brand name Splenda).<br /><br />Note that the product doesn't contain chocolate, though it's described as ""dark chocolate flavor"". The cocoa is roasted into the surface of the nut, but the almonds are not coated in chocolate. The good part about that is that they don't make a mess, and they're a better choice for someone who is trying to avoid sweets. But I'm sure some have bought these expecting to get chocolate and were disappointed.<br /><br />I liked them enough that I'll get them again, especially when I need something to cut the craving for chocolate candy. They have just enough chocolate flavor to do that, while having only one gram of sugars per serving."

They are much largers than the WW 2pt. bars and very filling. You could treat them as a snack or meal replacement. My local grocery is no longer carrying these bars as a result, I made my purchase through Amazon at a great price. I was paying a dollar or more for individual bars. The chocolate peanut is fabulous. Can easily curb your craving for a Snickers! I was also pleased with how fresh they were."
08	41743,B000COEZWS,A1UTWMAQP39NVC,12/17/08,0,0,4,Great product,"Well, we ordered the beef pockets and got chicken instead. Fortunately my dog will eat either kind so I wasn't too upset. Order arrived very quickly. These pill pockets are the best if you have dogs who don't take pills well. My dog thinks she is getting a treat every morning."
08	44788,B001EQ55RW,A3OKH5G69MS8D9,6/11/08,1,1,4,Cocoa Almonds,"I tried them and they are quite good - a novelty over regular almonds. The quality was quite high. The nuts in a newly opened package were fresh and crisp in texture with a very good taste.  I had 3 people try them, and all three said they liked them, and two said they would buy them at the grocery.  I would also buy them. Now more people have tried them with very positve response.  The only negative was too much green in the packaging, which did not affect the flavor if served in the dark."

The first time I tried these, I found it difficult to believe I wasn't eating candy. If you're trying to lose weight or if you just want a healthier alternative to your daily candy fix, this is the item for you."
08	17730,B000Z978SS,A1SO1PGDNVMLXC,8/9/08,91,94,5,Great stuff!,"If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their ""100% satisfaction guarantee"". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item ""powdered"".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products."
08	32215,B000MICPSA,ALVYD6HBLYI0W,3/23/08,2,3,5,Another good tasting meal from the Chef,"Tastes as good as the canned version. Only thing is, I'd like to see them a bit larger like 10 Oz. The choices now are 7.5 and 14.25 Oz. That is too big. 10 Oz would be just right."
08	44789,B001EQ55RW,A22I55P15NSAOX,5/30/08,1,1,4,"As a snack, ok.  As an ingredient, wonderful.","As a snack directly out out of the can I found these dry.  I guess when I think of chocolate almonds I like the mouth feel of actual chocolate melting and thus these almonds left me wanting more.  However, I found them to be an excellent ingredient in recipes that call for almonds.  Since they have  a LOT less salt than the typical almond they do not conflict with the sweetness of a dessert and the coating seems to keep them more crunchy in the batter.  I used them both whole in  brownies (fantastic) and chopped in choc chip cookies (great).  I chopped up too many for the cookies and used them to dust over vanilla ice cream served with the brownies.  Everyone raved about them."

That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!"

It's cheaper than canned, too, if you can find a local source. In using these to make recipes, I add the appropriate amount of base for the amount of water or liquid called for and do not add any salt called for by the recipe until the very end, when it can be added to taste.  I note the amont of salt added and record it for future use.  This is especially applicable in recipes calling for boullion cubes (horribly salty usually).  Of late, in talking with restaurant owners,I learned Minor bases a what many restaurants use.  The base keeps in the refridgerator seemingly forever.  Search the internet for sources or, better yet, ask your local restaurants if they use it and where they get their supplies locally."

We've also found it to be an exceptional immune system booster. We've tried many different brands of echinacea capsules many times over the years, but this tea seems to be especially potent and quick-acting - maybe because it's a blend of 3 species of echinacea, and also includes astragalus & elderberry.

Nobody wants cold or flu and I found that if I used this if I even thought I was getting sick it almost stopped it in it's tracks.  Sometimes I got a little achy from a cold but the cold did not last as long  nor was it as severe as it was without the tea.  My BF uses it now too, he has had the same experience with using it when you have just a beginning of a cold or flu...this stuff either knocks it out or at least deminishes it.  I thought the flavor was very good, almost sweet. It smells wonderful too :) I am not a sweetener user but this was good drinking hot or iced regardless if you sweeten."

I did a search for healthy treats and came across these happy hips.  The ingredients are natural and she absolutely loves them.  The idea that it is also benefitial for her joints adds a special bonus to the product.  No sugar or garbage in these.  I have been keying in on more protein in her diet as she has had digestive problems.  She has had not problems since I changed.  You can't go wrong with these.
08	44790,B001EQ55RW,ARFCORBCTKX1J,5/30/08,1,1,3,not what I expected...,"""Chocolate without guilt"" is a good idea, and coating nuts with sweetened cocoa powder (the sweetener is a mixture of a sugar alcohol -- sucralose -- and acesulfame) not a bad one at all. But the result is disappointing.<br /><br />The chocolate and almond tastes tend to hide each other rather than to complement each other. I was expecting an intense chocolate+almond taste, but didn't get it. There wasn't much of either.<br /><br />I tried sucking off the cocoa, but the naked almond was not particularly satisfying. A ""good"" almond, but not a great one.<br /><br />Almonds have a relatively delicate taste that (for me) is best appreciated without any enhancement. (I never cared for Jordan almonds.) A cocoa coating would probably work better with a stronger-flavored nut."

That being the bonus of this tea, you can add half of what you'd normally add to Earl grey [cream, lemon, honey] and save yourself a few calories.<br /><br />This is not a watered down version of Earl Grey, just a delicate tea."

I used to buy it in the powdered, but then the liquid came out and we used that.  Then now they have this concentrated creamer which is the best yet, we beleive it tastes better than the liquid and the powdered.  Also, it gives you more for your dollar.  The only downside is the pump.  Really cool idea if you could only remove it after putting it on.  I could understand at a business where you wouldn't want people tampering with it, but the pump leaves a  lot of creamer left in the bottom yet.  We leave it off and just pour it into the coffee, and when there is only a little left, we pour some coffee in it and get the rest out.  Also another plus, the container is recyclable in a lot of areas.  Go CoffeeMate!"

If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy! You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh and delicious. To keep them this way, I put them in two ""Freezer Bags"" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more bears plus a few different kinds as well. We all have our favorites!"
08	608,B000G6RYNE,AX668BUQRHI7C,7/20/08,1,1,4,Delicious!,"These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!"
08	29668,B0001GUQ20,A1QI7Z2DAZG11O,4/21/08,9,9,5,THE BEST SO FAR,"This is amazing stuff. The Minor's bases were recommended to me by one of the instructors at the New Orleans School of Cooking. He used some of the chicken base to make the eight cups of stock he used in a gumbo he was demonstrating. I've tried the beef and the chicken, and both are superb. They have a flavor that is identical to home made stock. The stuff keeps forever. Give any of the Minors bases a try and you will be sold. The only problem is the ridiculous shipping charge from Soupbase, the vendor. It's almost as much as the cost of the product."

I usually chop the chicken and add some Sriracha and place in fridge for a hour or two before actually making the salad. I've always received rave praise from guest concerning this simple dish.

It is the best you could ever make. I always made from scratch, but I believe this is even better. Unless I tell them, no one knows it wasn't made from scratch. So easy, and can use it for pork sausage, chicken, even ground beef. If you haven't tried it, you don't know what you are missing. Good price, best taste."

Having the lid measure out a 1.5 ounce serving is a nice touch, but not a big deal.  The flavor definitely reminds me more of cocoa than of chocolate, and isn't terribly strong.  Definitely do not buy these thinking you are getting chocolate-covered nuts of some sort!  But they are a decently healthy snack, and much healthier than eating said chocolate-covered nuts.  I'd rate them higher if the price was more economical, but as it is they are too pricey for a casual snack, but not ""snazzy"" enough for something ornate and formal.  For this price, I'd rather get cashews!"

08	44792,B001EQ55RW,A3R19YKNL641X3,5/28/08,1,1,4,mmmmm....  chocolate....  almonds...,"Usually when I think of nuts and chocolate together, I imagine the typical chocolate-dipped candy that happens to have a nut inside.  These Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds were a surprise departure from the ""candy"" path.  The nuts are dusted with a fine layer of dark chocolate power, meaning that the almond flavor is primary with a subtle chocolate background.  As a person who loves both those flavors, I felt like I was getting the best of both worlds...  a healthy snack that had a bit more ""zing"" than the typical offering.<br /><br />If I were in the mood for something to munch on without resorting to candy, this would be something I'd now consider as a possibility.  Another nice feature is the packaging...  the lid measures out a serving when you use it as the ""bowl"" for the nuts.  That goes a long ways towards avoiding the typical over-estimation of portion size.<br /><br />Good flavor, helpful packaging...  This probably won't be my last purchase of these almonds."
08	44793,B001EQ55RW,A30IP3E4MDQ36,5/28/08,1,1,4,"Nuts and chocolate, how can you go wrong?","Chocolate and nuts, two things that are great by themselves, but even better together!<br /><br />I love almonds, raw, roasted, spicy, sweet, you name it. So when I had the opportunity to try these I jumped on them.<br /><br />The first thing I did was read the label and I was disappointed to see that they added artificial flavoring and sweetener to them, not exactly my favorite thing to read on a label. Nonetheless I cracked the package open and tasted.<br /><br />After eating a small handful I was glad to see that they weren't overly sweet and you still tasted the almond.<br />The chocolate coating is a dry coating, so it doesn't melt off or leave a sticky residue. Sadly though I found the chocolate to be a bit weak and more of a semi-sweet, not dark.<br /><br />The nuts themselves were high quality, not a single one was over roasted or left a bitter nasty taste in my mouth, Diamond definitely provides a high quality nut!<br /><br />Overall these are a great snack, barely sweet and with a hint of cocoa. That and they are a good source of protein and vitamin E."

You can make any amount you want, just put three teaspoons of granules in a one cup measuring jug and fill with hot water and stir, stir, stir. It will thicken by itself and be delicious.  Once you get used to it you can make small amounts, say for one person just by judging the amount of granules as you stir hot water in.

08	10162,B003EML8PM,A294XIDCE087BB,4/6/08,31,33,5,Wonderful if you can handle salt,"I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you."

I found these on a health food site and couldn't believe it, so I ordered a box.  They are really yummy and as long as you don't overindulge, you should enjoy them every time you are seeking something crunchy and salty (and low in carbs!)."
08	10165,B003EML8PM,A377IGU7KZH80L,4/18/08,14,15,4,Great snack,"These are an interesting and tasty alternative to microwave popcorn, well worth trying. The spicy version is not very spicy, but has a little kick. Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming ""diet food."" They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack."

08	32482,B000LKYY6A,AB0TLNLNOAGY4,10/23/08,2,2,5,Pregnancy Survival!,"When I wound up with terrible morning sickness, everyone had some food or method to recommend for feeling better.  I heard it all--and very little worked for me in the slightest.  I spent my days being miserable and feeling sick as anything.  But when I was visiting a friend, she happened to have a package of Gin Gins and offered me one.  I was already chewing on raw ginger to help things, so I figured it couldn't hurt.<br /><br />Rarely has anyting tasted so good as that candy did to my morning sick stomach!  Sweet, but not too sweet, with enough of a gingery bite.  One hard candy could last a while and keep the nausea down.  The first thing I did when I had a chance was order a whole case of the things!  After that I always had a bag tucked into my pocket book throughout the first months of my pregnancy.  Unlike raw ginger, there was no preparation time involved, and the candy is much more pleasant to eat and easier to share with others. (I still like raw ginger and ginger tea, though).  Since then, I've recommended and shared my stash of Gin Gins with several pregnant friends--and they've given me positive feedback as well.<br /><br />Gin Gins also makes a chewable kind--but that's hard on the teeth and can pull out a filling if you're not careful! Plus it's a sharper taste than the hard candies, so it may not appeal as universally.  My only regret is that there doesn't appear to be a sugar free variety of these on the market, and that is something I could have used.  Still, all in all a great investment and one of the most useful things I bought for my early pregnancy.  Beats saltine crackers any day!<br /><br />Enjoy! ^_^ Shanshad"

With a hint of dark chocolate, yet retaining a nutty ""roasted"" base, these savory little nuggets make a good, light snack.<br /><br />High in vitamin E, iron, and calcium, and having mostly good lipids (fats), almonds are a delicious way to keep a balanced diet.  Don't expect ""Cocoa Roast"" Almonds to be a total confection--like chocolate covered raisins.  With only 150 calories per ounce, a little bit goes a long way.

With the Wyler's Light Pink Lemonade packets, I've found that I'm actually drinking a lot more water than I used to. I started mixing a packet in my water bottle once a day; now I'm mixing up about three bottles a day! This stuff makes water taste so good! It honestly doesn't have that Nutri-Sweet taste that a lot of ""light"" drinks do. I'd definitely recommend this product to everyone I know!"

Almost the same color and consistency and an even milder flavor. There is no pulp or plant ground up in it so it is very smooth. Sometimes I drink my dose by itself, other times I mix it in any juice because this mangosteen juice doesn't change the flavor.<br /><br />I've heard alot of health claims about mangosteen, pomegranate and acai but I really can't say it's done anything for me, I've only been taking mangosteen for a couple months. I just enjoy knowing I'm putting the good stuff in my system.<br />I like the Amazon automatic delivery system, too, since I can't find this locally, it saves me time and money."

Watered down per my estimation, not as XanGo Mangosteen Juice I used to buy. Sorry, I am not switching to this one. On positive side I tied other products of the same company - Acai Juice Blend Dynamic Health, at it was outstanding, will buy again."

The juice is ""Mangosteen Queen"" sold at the mangosteenjuice.ws that is similar to the Dynamic Health Gold mangosteen.<br /><br />These individuals report higher energy levels probably due to sleeping better and disappearance of pains they have had prior to drinking these type of mangosteen juices.<br /><br />One even received comments of looking ten years younger without soliciting for it.<br /><br />I for one lost my suceptibility to allergy due to pollen in the fall; something I have had for many decades. I must admit that I only drank this pure mangosteen for maybe at most 3 days at a time for perhaps 4 times since August due to cost. Drinking it even inconsistently at 1/2 to 2/3 cup a day has its rewards apparently."

I had to let my friends and family know.<br />Now I have received so many thank you's, not only from my friends and family, but also by their children, their family and friends too.<br />Everyone I have told about this product are so thankful and tell me how easy it was for them to use it and how delicious everything is.<br />I've also told them that I use it in my stuffing/dressing, gravy/sauce, my turkey soup etc.  Also, I works great with chicken and duck.  This is one of the best, most used product in my kitchen... I use about 2-3 tins of Nantucket Offshore Turkey Rub, per year and so do my friends.<br />One of my friends just moved to PA, so I ordered a couple of tins and sent it to her and she called me and said, ""You saved our Thanksgiving!..."""

08	44799,B001EQ55RW,A1B4MIXYVIKMU2,5/21/08,1,1,4,great for the dark chocolate and almonds lover,"When I had ordered this product, I was expecting lightly dark chocolate covered almonds. These almonds were a bit different from what I had expected. They're actually almonds that have been dusted with dark cocoa powder.  I only point this out for others who may have expected smooth dark chocolate covered almonds. At any rate, these almonds were still very delicious and the dark chocolate cocoa powder complimented the taste of roasted almonds very nicely. Here are some pros and cons in my humble opinon:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Great taste with a bouquet of complex aromas and textures... yummy.<br />-Large 11 oz canister container, perhaps not good if you're on a diet :)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-I would've liked it a bit sweeter... perhaps a touch of honey would have been splendid... in fact, I'm sure it would've been.<br /><br />conclusion: If you enjoy roasted almonds and love dark chocolate, these almonds will hit the spot. Just remember... these are dusted, not chocolate dipped!"

One soda with the stuff in it gives me a migraine. Being an idiot, I've tested this with several different Splenda containing products & found that the sweetner is the problem. SO if you are like me, avoid this product.<br /><br />That said, I did pop a few in my mouth before reading the label & they are yummy. I am only a sometimes fan of almonds, but I love dark chocolate.<br /><br />My partner (who doesn't have a Splenda hating noggin & who loves dark chocolate even more than me) was quite fond of these little nuggets. 6g protein (and 13g fat) in a 1/4 cup...not bad.

I'm a total choco-phile and I'm always looking for ways to get my fix without the all-consuming waistline guilt.<br /><br />It's not as decadent as what you'll get in a restaurant but then again those babies pack anywhere from 20-50 grams of fat per cake.  Let's not even TALK about the calories!<br /><br />I've tried both the plain chocolate and the mint chocolate version of this product and both are VERY good.  I recommend it for anyone, but particularly for choco-holics who don't want to consume a whole day's fat allowance in one shot! ;)"
08	56376,B000EHL21U,A1KVMWWANPKWN0,4/1/08,4,5,5,Very tasty,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good."

I like almonds, particularly for their health benefits that are fairly well known. I usually avoid them covered in salt and flavoring powder, but I'm glad I gave these a try.<br /><br /> The packaging suggests Dark Chocolate, and it would be easy to get the wrong idea that these will taste chocolate in the sense of Milk Chocolate perhaps. I just expected them to taste like almonds and cocoa, which they do, so they are semi sweet and like other reviewers have noted, they will appeal most to dark chocolate fans."

08	44802,B001EQ55RW,A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ,5/19/08,1,1,5,"Emerald - Cocoa Roast Alomonds, Net Wt. 11 ounces",Delicious snack that's easily addictive. I like this flavor just as much as the other two Emerald cannister of almonds I've tried recently. Has a most distinctive dark chocolate almond flavor. I've seen this item in the grocery  store for $2.99 and sometimes slightly higher. Appears to have the chocolate powder sprinkled and baked onto the almond - so there's no mess. Great to sneak in under your jacket when catching a movie at the neighborhood theater.
08	44803,B001EQ55RW,A1TWH3KD5YJQHM,5/18/08,1,1,4,A snack for grownups,"What I expected were almonds covered with a chocolate glaze, like the ones you'd get at the movies, except dark instead of milk chocolate. These aren't that. The almonds are instead covered with a very light, only subtly sweet powdering of chocolate - only one gram of sugar per quarter-cup serving, which is hardly any. It's not really a sweet and you don't feel like you're eating candy. If you have these around, the kids won't eat them. They'll leave them for you."
08	44804,B001EQ55RW,A3TPNC3TKGCCEI,5/18/08,1,1,4,Cocoa Roast Almonds - Yummy all the way.,"Emerald makes great nuts and their delicious Cocoa Roast Almonds continues to show off the quality you get from them. Each crunchy roasted almond is powder coated with a fleeting but rich cocoa flavor. The taste is wonderfully delicious but not decadently so.<br /><br />My first taste gave me a blast from the past if just for a brief millisecond. COCOA PEBBLES! Ah! But it was only for the briefest moment, then the yummy nutty roasted almond flavor kicks in. I have no complaints with that...snacking on sugary childhood cereals, though divine on the lips, will wreck havoc on the hips. I'll gladly upgrade to Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds and enjoy nearly the same divine pleasure without the guilt.<br /><br />The cocoa flavor is rather fleeting but it still makes these snacks worthwhile. I enjoy roasted almonds, but I tend to get bored with them quickly. Too many jars of roasted almonds have gotten stale on my shelf from neglect. With Emerald Cocoa Roast almonds, the cocoa roast flavor keeps me coming for more without wanting to overindulge either. A few nuts is all it takes for me to enjoy a tasty cocoa treat, still enjoy the healthy benefits of almonds, and be satisfied. It's a great balance of wanting to spoil yourself yet still enjoy a healthy treat.<br /><br />Now, the naughty girl in me will want to spill these lovely cocoa-covered nuts on top of a chocolate frosted chocolate chip cake, call it healthy, and have a divine chocolate experience...but that's cheating big time. I'll be happy with these cocoa roasted nuts and avoid the cake for now.<br /><br />My only negative with Emerald is their price, but you get what you pay for. With Emerald, I always know I'm getting quality nuts that are going to taste GREAT, regardless of the flavor.<br /><br />If you like roasted almonds and enjoy the flavor of cocoa, I don't doubt you'll enjoy these nuts. Emerald make good nuts and these are no exception. Cocoa roasted almonds are the healthy alternative choice to chocolate almond candies. No guilt on the conscience.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've shared these with my family and the one thing we agree on is that the cocoa flavor goes too quickly. Longer lasting cocoa flavor would be super. Other than that, we all like and enjoy these nuts. As for me, I'm getting quickly addicted to them. I'm finding myself floating back to these yummy nuts to get more. Great snack! I'll GLADLY buy these again.<br /><br />UPDATE #2: I WANT TO UPGRADE TO FIVE STARS! I've tried some other of Emerald's nuts and the Cocoa Almonds come out tops! These have become number one in my book. I crave these!"

I like the flavor. The cocoa flavor is rich and the baking process increases its depth. And they'd be great for guests.  But there is no way I'll keep something like this in the house.<br /><br />And I find the idea that the container is shaped for the cup holder of a car to be very strange.  The idea of driving along and popping these little caloric bombs makes me shudder.  I doubt this is what nutritionists mean when they suggest eating nuts as part of a balanced diet."
08	44806,B001EQ55RW,ALNFHVS3SC4FV,5/18/08,1,1,3,What's Not to Love??????,"With almonds and chocolate, what's not to love? Well... these aren't dipped in chocolate almonds, these are baked in chocolate flavor. The baked in chocolate flavor provides no mess but the baked in flavor kind of gives it a burnt flavor to me. These almonds were just alright, I was a little disappointed in them. They also get their lightly sweet flavor from Sucralose which I think provides a fake kind of sweetness flavor. Overall, if you really love almonds and are looking for a healthy snack then you might like these but if you are looking for a chocolate snack then you'll be disappointed with these."

It is, however, sweet enough that it is a pleasure to eat. I am surprised that what I am asked to review is called a Turtle Bar; I just re-read the description and what I got was definitely not the Turtle bar because the center was vanilla and not chocolate.  I don't really care because I was looking for a tasty Kashi product, hoping for something less sugary than other meal replacement bars and these goals were met. I will be trying other flavors anyway.  One caution: this bar requires a good set of teeth to eat--lots of crunch and chew (which make it more satisfying, in my opinion).  If you like Kashi products in general, you will probably like this one."

I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty."

It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12."

They were pretty much just plain dry roasted almonds with Cocoa powder mixed with Splenda sprinkled on them. I could only really taste the chocolate with my first bite.

So as not to get too monotonous, I do like to switch things up among some of the more high protein nuts.  Consequently, upon seeing these cocoa roasted almonds, I was thrilled to try them.<br /><br />I actually love the taste of these nuts.  My comments:<br /><br />(1)  They have just enough cocoa to give them a nice sweetness without being overwhelming (and making you feel like you just consumed a week's worth of calories in a single snack).  I am not a big sweet lover which makes this characteristic appealing; To one with a big sweet-tooth or looking for an after-dinner dessert, you might find yourself disappointed with these.<br /><br />(2)  For the people that tested these in my household, the appeal was widespread.  My husband and two children (ages 2 and 5) loved them, probably even more than I.  They came to the consensus that the cocoa coating tasted a bit like an Oreo cookie.  With the lower calories and healthy protein, I am happy to have my children snack on these versus some of the other cookie/cracker options out there.<br /><br />(3)  The container is nice -- a good size and shape for holding.  It was easily managed by myself as well as my 2-year old.  The top is a screw-top which, in my opinion, is much nicer than the common flip tops.  I am uncertain as to whether the snacks stay fresher this way (the nuts did not last long enough to test it) but the top minimizes spills that can be frustrating with the flip tops.<br /><br />All in all, I would buy these again.  Further, I would recommend them to someone who likes almonds and can appreciate the mild sweetness of the cocoa coating.  If you are looking for a sweet, chocolate covered nut (like a mini milk-chocolate snickers), you will be disappointed.  This is not a candy bar but it is a great alternative snack."
08	44814,B001EQ55RW,A1UCPXUBSESD65,5/24/08,4,6,2,"Sorry, I didn't agree with y'all","These fell short on flavor, sweetness, and satisfaction. As other reviewers have mentioned, they do have a bit of an after taste too.  Trader Joe's are way better and at a much better price.<br /><br />For those that absolutely want less calories and low sugar they would get you by, but for me, I'd rather have a little less of something really good."

Much to my dismay, they stopped carrying it.  The ingredients on both bottles are the same even though they were listed in a slightly different order.

08	44815,B001EQ55RW,A23GFTVIETX7DS,6/11/08,2,3,3,"Tastes good, but not for chocolate lovers (3+ stars)","Anything that claims to be ""dark chocolate"" flavored immediately has my attention, as I'm a true chocoholic with a preference for the intense bittersweet flavor of a good dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, these cocoa-dipped almonds don't deliver on the promise of their name, although they are indeed a good, nutritious (but high fat) snack with a hint of sweetness and chocolate flavor.  Not surprisingly, the predominant flavor is almond; the nutty, skin-on taste overwhelms the chocolate dusting.  Nut lovers will likely appreciate the twist on an old favorite since the cocoa does indeed bring out the almond flavor.  The almonds are crunchy and roasted to perfection, with few or no overdone brown interiors.<br /><br />Diabetics and others who watch their sugar intake will be pleased to learn that this snack contains only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving because of the addition of sucralose, an artificial sweeteners better known commercially as Splenda.  Dieters, however, will want to be careful with the 13 grams of fat in that same size serving.<br /><br />In general, I like Emerald nut products, but this one disappointed me, mostly because I found the chocolate flavor lacking and because I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  When I crave nuts, I go right for this canister, but when I crave chocolate, I look for something else.<br /><br />Also from the same company and recommended by me:  Emerald Nuts Glazed Pecans, Pecan Pie, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12), <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELWG3E"">Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Peanut, Honey Roasted Peanut & Cocktail Peanut, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 18)</a>, Emerald Nuts Glazed Walnuts, Original, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)"

We are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal.

One look at the nutritional value of Skinner's versus Post or Kellogg's on the basis of sodium (skinner's very low) and fiber (skinner's very high) will tell you to give this a try.

But in our family, that's not a problem.  All bags of chews, no matter the brand, seem to have this issue...thick and thin together...but we just use it to our advantage.  We have 2 dogs: the one we raised from a pup likes a big, thick chew, the other is older and a rescue, and though we take him to the dentist regularly, his teeth are just very sensitive so the smaller chews work out great for him.  The ones in the middle they share equally.<br /><br />Another thing, each chew is coated differently.  The smaller more wrinkled up chews have more of it than the thicker chews which have a smoother surface.  But our boys don't seem to notice these small differences and we're happy as long as they're happy.  In fact, one of the best parts of our evening is watching them settle down beside each other, each with their respective CET chew, engaged in knawing away the time.<br /><br />Is CET messing with the consumer by not correctly sizing their chews 100%?

These are composite product as opposed to a rawhide chew.  They do not splinter and do not make a big sloppy mess, but they do have a pretty strong smell.  We give her one a day and if we forget, she asks for it.  The price through Amazon was about half what my vet charged."

It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no ""palm"" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more."

I think this is a product that is more useful in baking than a hot tea - it seems to require a lot of careful mixing that is too much hassle for a quick cuppa. It was green and not brown like one of the reviews here stated. I just bought an ice cream maker and am planning to use it for that or just to add to my morning smoothie for a boost. I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!"

For my part, I found the almonds a little dry, so I was not sure how the kids would like it.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  They loved the almonds and begged for more.  So if you want to give your kids something more healthy for lunches and snack (and anything is better than hot cheetos) then this is a great product.  Now, if only we could get these cocoa almonds for the same price as cheap chessy snacks utterly devoid of nutritional value."

In fact, she usually will not eat in the morning until we give her one of these chews.  Her teeth are nice and white.<br /><br />They do not splinter and do not make a mess.  The only negative is that she holds them between her paws and they leave a light brown discoloration on her white fur.  It does wash (or lick) right off.  I would not let your dog have them on a light colored carpet.<br /><br />Great product at a reasonable price if you shop around a little on line."

If you want the stuff used in a Japanese tea ceremony, plan to pay a minimum of a dollar a gram, but if you want a lot of decent matcha for other purposes at a good price, this is it."

It is a delicious tea. My friends even enjoyed it. It is not a heavy oolong tea, or even the traditional oolong such as Iron goddess of mercy or Jade oolong, both of which are my ultimate favorites. Also, know this: Rishi makes the best oolong tea so do not skimp on your tea :)! Be sure not to overbrew, and follow instructions on how much to use. Also use filtered water to boil, it will improve the taste over tap water. I love using my brita water in the zojirushi which has hot water ready to go at all times at my house."

08	28278,B000LKV04E,A15AX7PWR2HZE7,11/29/08,1,1,5,My Favorite Chocolate,"Dagoba (pronounced duh GO buh) Dark is the best chocolate I've ever tried.<br />A previous reviewer said they threw this chocolate out because of it's ""artificial taste"". Some people are so used to Tootsie Rolls and Ho-Ho's that they honestly have no idea what chocolate tastes like.<br />As my gramma used to say, ""there's no accounting for taste.""<br />Dagoba is chocolate. Pure, organic, fairly traded, and delicious chocolate.<br />I used this to make brownies (per Cook's Illustrated's suggestion) because mine always seemed to lack deep flavor. Dagoba fixed that. Try making one batch with the cheapest semisweet chocolate at the store (Nestle or Hershey's or whatever) and one batch with Dagoba Dark. Then serve them to your friends and see which they prefer. It makes an obvious and remarkable difference.<br /><br />And for plain old eating, it's equally tasty. I've tried just about every plain dark chocolate bar at the fancy grocery store and I can't find any I like better than Dagoba Dark. Some that cost the same or even more are terrible. Some are almost as good, but none are better. Dagoba Dark is expensive, but it's a good value. There are a ton of chocolates that the real aficionadoes like even better that but the prices on those ultra premium brands like Amedei and Michel Cluizel are insane - $14.50 for 1.8 ounces! Can you believe that nonsense?<br />For $2.50 a bar, if you like flavorful chocolate, I don't think you can go wrong with Dagoba Dark.<br />The ONLY thing I'm not pleased about is that Dagoba is now just another division of a mega-corp (Hershey's) so you never know when they'll try to save a penny by compromising quality or organic or fair trade principles."

08	6260,B000E65OF6,A281NPSIMI1C2R,5/27/08,0,0,5,Perfect for the Evening,"Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

My large local grocery in a major metropolitan city took forever to start carrying them, and they were more expensive. I was very happy to see Amazon have them on a special Kashi deal, and in bulk.<br /><br />As for the product itself...I love the natural cheese flavor. I've never been a Nips fan, because the flavor tasted fake, too salty, and left an unpleasant after taste. These Kashi crackers have great texture, crunch, and taste, and they are a healthy snack, too. I eat them alone, or with a nice crisp apple. Yum!!"

Buffy, Princess of Goldens, loves these and takes each daily treat out to the front yard to roll on before consuming - high praise from her. My vet recommended them over the usual grain, fat, and corn syrup based treats. This is one of the few treats I'm comfortable with giving daily, it's not doggie junk food."

I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it."

I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime."

The first thing I noticed upon opening the can was the aroma. It was rich and full. The tea is wonderfully dried with consistently large pieces with some white tips evenly dispersed.<br /><br />The tea steeps nicely with wonderful, but not overpowering, flavor with only slight hints of bitterness often found in Earl Grey. The Bergamot was not too strong and added nicely to this great cup of tea."

It's this exact product and they are my new favorite party food. Everyone raves about them and they require no prep at all. The only thing I recommend is drain as much of the oil off as you can, as they can be greasy. They are only mildly spicy, and go well with all types of fare. Despite my best efforts to cook everything I serve, no matter what else I make, these always take top compliments."

After trying this tea, to my surprise and delight I may have found another favorite!<br /><br />This tea is very smooth with low acidity and it goes a long way. This is a loose tea and it brews up wonderfully in the Bodum double wall infuser cup. You can make several cups of tea with just a heaping teaspoon of this loose tea and each cup tastes great without being weak.<br /><br />The lemony bergomot is a lovely subtle addition that tastes and smells wonderful. The tea has a beautiful dark amber color and a full rounded flavor without the acidic bite some tea can have.<br /><br />At first the price seemed a bit high but after using it and seeing how little you actually need to use I would recommend this highly as a great value and consider it for gift giving. Then again once you try it you may not want to give it away. Very enjoyable tea!"

That's the first problem.  The name of each of these pyramid teas says you're getting 1 tea, when in fact you are getting at least 2, and then a mountain of other ingredients -- most of which are not even hinted at by the name.<br /><br />It's true, white tea is the first ingredient listed.  Then green tea.  Then apple pieces.  Then a litany of all the cheap add-ins available to fill a tea bag.  The pom -- is barely there at all, in the form of juice concentrated and then powdered into bits.  And blueberry is so far down the list that it's barely there at all.<br /><br />Of 15 listed ingredients, all the fruit (except the apple) are listed AFTER cornstarch and ""natural flavor"".<br /><br />What kind of tea is this that has blueberry and pom in the name -- yet has more cornstarch and the mysterious ""natural flavor"" than the microscopic bits of fruit and juice?<br /><br />CORNSTARCH?  In tea?  forget this stuff and find some Numi, or Republic of Tea, or Stash, or Celestial Seasonings tea that has the actual tea (white? green? black? rooibos? mint? chamomile?) in the name -- and then only minimal anything-else.  No fillers.  No thickeners.  No crap.  Almost any of the name companies in this price range give you more actual tea (and identifiable other ingredients) than this.<br /><br />And it tastes bad. The ""white tea"" they are using tastes astringent and peppery.<br /><br />Go for full leaf from a reputable tea merchant to be sure you're not getting a dainty little bag full of straw and leftovers -- which this is."

I don't like strong teas, and wanted a black tea that I didn't have to water down or add suger to.  This is a good tea, and buying it from Amazon was also a good deal.  I normally pay $12 a box, and it is more like $10 a box, when you purchase the pack of two.<br /><br />Thanks again, Amazon, and Twinings!"

But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard.

Blue popcorns seem to have more flavor than yellow or white. I think the selling point of this type is that because the kernels are small the hulls shatter when it pops (""hullless""), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. It's not going to be completely hullless but compared to regular large yellow popcorn the hulls are pretty much gone. The resulting popped corn is smaller than you may be used to, though.

They are positively incredible!  It's a dark chocolate filled with espresso and a big pick-me-up.  We used them on the night shifts, helping to stay awake, but the taste is fantastic.  Very unusual.  I've been trying to get them for years, and recently treated myself on Amazon, with half paid by gift certificate.  Give Pocket Coffees a try...they're unusual and exciting.  Not for children, the taste of coffee is pretty intense."

I had to buy a new box as my dog (yes, he is still alive) snatched her purchase off the counter while we were out and ate the whole box, wrappers and all. The best part is the surprise burst of coffee as you bite into the chocolate! Warn others not to try to bite in half.

My kids love it because it tastes like a chocolate drink and it is loaded with healthy vegetables and nutrients.<br />I was so glad to find a way to get some extra vegetables in their daily diet and mine as well. It is also easy to fix-just add water and stir for a few seconds and there you are!
08	33026,B00112K2MC,AGGB8GNM27ZR6,4/26/08,4,4,5,Kidz superfood a great food booster,"I have been using this product for the last 6 months with my 20 month old toddler.  We do not use it in her milk or water because she likes drinking them but we do use this product with her plain yogurt and with her 8 grain hot cereal.  She loves it!  Chocolate yogurt and oatmeal, sweet!!  I like the added vitamins from veggies that it offers, and low sugar content! I found that if I can find this with free shipping it is about 3 dollars cheaper then what I can buy it for in the store."

08	19454,B000BXX20G,A1ZR28SCA9CRPQ,5/29/08,3,3,5,Natural tasting pear flavor,"Rest assured, this tea has a natural tasting pear flavor.  Although this tea does included real pear pieces, they also use a pear flavoring to amplify the taste (apparently brewing pear pieces doesn't kick it up quite enough.) It's been my experience that some pear flavor is pretty awful (ala absolut pears,) this stuff is really good, and quite flavorful."

A minute and a half in the microwave, and you've got warm, crunchy deliciousness.  There's just the right amount of spice, too.  This is a great product."

Only problem is it never seems to incorporate into your drink. I've tried using a blender, a spoon and even soaking it overnight in water but you always have to shake it before you drink it cuz it doesn't disolve. Tastes not bad with just water though."

08	78943,B0018MUNEW,ABLOQZIL42W7I,8/30/08,0,0,5,Trident White SUGARLESS Gum with Xylitol,"This is a great product for people who want to improve their oral health.  The key feature in the gum is Xylitol, a sugar derived from the birch tree.  Xylitol is naturally sweet, so no added sugar is necessary, however, the added benefit of xylitol is that oral bacteria (the ones that cause tooth decay and gum disease) ingest xylitol, cannot digest it, and as a result - die!  This lowers bacterial counts in the mouth, which if done consistently, lowers the pathogenic bacteria, thus lowering the potential for cavities.  There are several gums that advertize the ingredient xylitol, but check the package carefully, some add additional sugars that bacteria love, thereby negating the positive effect of xylitol.  Most people who buy xylitol gum do so with the intent to lower cavity risk.  A usual daily dose of xylitol is chewing 5 sticks a day for 5 minutes a time.  Several toothpastes also have xylitol in them, such as Spry <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0560O"">Spry Sugar Free Toothpaste with Fluoride, Spearmint 4 oz</a>.  (I always recommend a toothpaste with fluoride, so get the Spry with fluoride - it also comes in a non-fluoride formulation too).  The flavor of this gum tends to wear off rather quickly, but then the intent is to dose the mouth with xylitol, not necessarily to promote gum chewing or gum chewing pleasure.<br /><br />Bought in bulk, as in this package, the cost is reduced.<br /><br />kone"
08	28227,B000V9PH4O,A291GRSK1IV6KZ,3/22/08,3,3,5,Yum!,My current favorite tea. I had basically given up on Lipton teas before trying the pyramid series. I'm glad I gave them one more try.
08	26724,B0009RM2WS,A27UAV5WNW3OWL,11/10/08,1,1,5,get up & GO !!!,"This stuff is fantastic. I agree with the other complimentry reviews. might i suggest mixing a small amount of this powder with a shot of olive oil?! I actually think it may lengthen the effect even mnore by doing this and it is a fat soluble so it's a lot easier to get down. Because of the chemistry of this molecule, it is bitter and never tastes good. If it really bothers you, it's possible to order some gelatin capsules and make your own guarana capsules! That way you can swallow them and will not have to deal with the taste:)"
08	28225,B000V9PH4O,A2OUYF5QAFVDGZ,4/13/08,4,4,5,Perfect Blend,"Hey, the smell is wondrous and its very soothing. The taste of the white tea and  blueberry pomegranate are perfectly blended. The pack of six is well worth it, this tea will become your go to tea for everyday! Enjoy"
08	10328,B003EML8PM,A1MLXVVVLBPF7L,11/16/08,1,1,5,Yummmmm!,"Just got these and tried them over the weekend.  They were easy to cook and taste great.  My husband saw that I had them and tried them as well, so now I'm glad they come 15 to a box.  These will be a staple on our snack shelf.  There is a big differance between store bought and these.  These are sooo much fresher (and tastier).  They also fit very well into my high protein/low-carb diet.  It's wonderful to snack on something with a crunch to it!"
08	44849,B000FPM5DA,AK0CENM3LUM28,9/30/08,0,0,4,Good Treat in Moderation,"Dingo Munchy Stick / B000FPM5DA<br /><br />When I first bought these, my puppy was 3 months old and 6 pounds heavy. I wanted something that he could chew on to keep him interested and out of trouble when I couldn't watch him for short periods of time, for instance, when I take a shower. The treats didn't quite last the entire shower, but they did the trick for a time. Now he's a month older and another 6 pounds heavier and I'm lucky if the treat lasts long enough for me to get to the shower!<br /><br />Obviously, my dog likes these. He finishes them very quickly, maybe too quickly for the price, but the Amazon 4-for-3 deal still makes it worthwhile. I'm a little concerned about the rawhide in the sticks - I have been told by our trainer that rawhide can cause impaction in the digestive tract - but I think that the small shreds of rawhide in these sticks are probably safe. Still, I'm considering phasing these out to beef-hide sticks (not the same as rawhide), especially since the Dingo Stix do not last very long.<br /><br />As usual, I had no trouble with Amazon shipping, and the Stix look and smell the same as the ones from the local pet store - no weird odor or any signs of spoilage from sitting in a warehouse too long. I will probably continue to order these for as long as the 4-for-3 deal lasts.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"

This is that great Maxwell House flavor from filter packs that are incredibly easy to use. My coffee making skills are very limited and I get compliments on my coffee now! Highly recommended
08	10329,B003EML8PM,A29ON7DBR7NMO2,11/15/08,1,1,5,my nightly snack,NO CARBS  This is my favorite snack -  very light and crunchy.  Not as dry as the packaged pork rinds.  I love these -  Been getting these for 6 years and still order them every 2-3 months.

08	44850,B000FPM5DA,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,8/5/08,0,0,5,Dogs love them!,I have 2 dogs and both of them LOVE these things. They don't last long (at least not with my dogs) but they are great treats to give them. Highly recommend.
08	26722,B0009RM2WS,AHJ3XDYGCDZB,4/22/08,8,9,5,Be brave and just try it !  Put it in Yogurt or Applesauce,"My secret weapon to perform hard work with a great attitude.  Guanine (a caffeine analog) gives a long lasting stimulant boost while theobromine provides the attitude adujstment of chocolate.  A wonderful delight that got me to quit coffee which is jittery, short-acting and just pale in comparison.<br /><br />Guanine is oil-based so it's hard to dissolve in water but that allows for slow-release in your body.  Be brave, depending on your body size use a teaspoon to a tablespoon.  If you can consume a tablespoon of coffee you can certainly consume a tbsp of this.<br /><br />Instead of trying to dissolve into liquid put it in Yogurt or Apple Sauce.  Makes a great low calorie breakfast that stays with you and reduces hunger.<br /><br />Truly an amazing product that leaves a six-hour silly grin on my face with motivation to clean the garage !"

These are great for a quick treat or snack, but if your dog needs more of a ""chewing workout"" try the mini bones or rawhides instead.  These munchy stix come in 2 flavors: beef (red) and a parsley and baking soda (green)variety that helps freshen stinky dog breath.  My dogs recommend that you get both!"

08	78918,B001E5DZSY,A3H906VCUE4GD1,5/7/08,9,9,5,Great popcorn,"This corn pops beautifully in our air popper, and it has a wonderful taste.  There are very few unpopped kernels left when I turn off the popper.  Although the kernels are multi-colored, they're a creamy white after they pop.  The taste is faintly nutty and good enough that we don't have to add other flavorings or salt, just a little olive oil spray.  A 1/2 cup serving of kernels pops up into a large bowlful of corn, great for 2 people to snack on."
08	78917,B001E5DZSY,A35EYL5HER6HZR,7/10/08,9,9,5,Great flavor and healthy.,"This popcorn has a great flavor, and as suggested by others we sprayed a little olive oil on it and lightly salted it.  Very good corn from the hot air popper.<br /><br />Some folks have expressed concerns over how this popcorn does not turn out as ""big and fluffy"" as the store brands or other national brands.  This IS true.  Keep in mind that those other brands have been bred to be big and fluffy, but not necessarily tasty.  I prefer the good taste of this corn over the big and fluffy ""cardboard corn"" any day!"

Well they discontinued carring them and I was BUMMED OUT beyond belief. I LOVE THESE THINGS. I done a search on line and found then on amazon.com and you can't imagine how happy I was. I bought 2 cases of them. My whole family is addicted to them. Did i mention I LOVE THESE THINGS. They go into my microwave for 1 minute and 20 seconds and you have hot fresh pork rinds. They are so much better than the pork rinds in the bag on the potato chip isle. 2 Thumbs Up"

They had a terrible smell.  My dog took one sniff and walked away (she usually eats any ""treat"" I give her).  I think this product should be taken off of the Amazon sales site.  I usually like to shop for products at Amazon.  Now I am leery to do so."

Make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top.  It is quick, easy, and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or don't feel like going out for lunch."

But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this."

I love pasta, but for my uses preparing a fresh batch, then adding the sauce would be both expensive, and time consuming. This is the best solution. I will buy this variety again in the future, in the can version, for more days."

08	50911,B00139C3P2,A360EFJOE4L7IZ,5/26/08,8,8,5,Fine Food for Diverse Cats,"I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well."

I used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it.  I am a lover of Starbucks Espresso Decaf coffee.  I have my own Breville espresso machine at home.  I have been using Starbucks for years.  My Lavazzo coffee arrived and I was eager to give it a try.  I opened the tin to find brown coffee - while I already knew I would be disappointed because I already know I prefer Black coffee beans to brown. While it pulled a decent looking cup, I put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds. One sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband.  So. My verdict here is, if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee DO NOT buy this product.  If you prefer brown bean coffee, give it a go."

I bought 2 cases, and when I run out will probably get more."

It's so good that I keep buying this same brand mix when I run out.<br /><br />I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix; 1 egg; 5/8 cup water; 2 tablespoon melted butter) and it's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full-size Belgian waffle maker.<br /><br />Easy to make and very tasty.

Well, as you can imagine, many a reluctant preschooler is willing to pee in a cup with that in mind.  How wonderful to show them that there are green hoppy frogs!  We just put a couple in a (clean) Dixie cup and return it to the children.  I wish I could download the expressions on their faces when they see these little creatures!  Oh, by the way, 5 lb bag lasted over 6 months in my solo rural pediatric office- that is a lot of urine samples!  Many  siblings insists on giving a sample also just for a taste of these gummies!"

Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch ""Organix;"" he likes ""Evo"" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon."

The only solution I can think of would be a cotton tea ""sock"" - yes, sock is a legitimate term used in the tea business.<br /><br />Ordinarily I am a snob in terms of preferring loose leaf to tea bags.

Definitely not working for my dog anymore.  Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for.  I know everyone's hurting financially, but I think in this case the dogs got sold down the river for a few bucks.  Disappointing."

My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there."

We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.

The only exception is that I give them the Happy Bellies oatmeal as well as their rice and multigrain. These have extra iron formulated to be easily absorbed and also the probiotics which are probably part of the reason both babies are nice and regular. They're organic and whole grain so they're healthy and train the babies taste to like whole grain. I mix it with water and they gobble it up and love it.

Now she is much more regular. Once i could not find the HappyBellies rice cereal at the store and got the Earth Best instead. The baby didn't like it and it was hard to feed through the bottle<br /><br />The only problem i have is what's up with the 3/4 of the container? Why it is not as full as it's used to be? Keeping static price in expense of the quantity i guess? oh well...economy it is

Not only is this product iron fortified, but also has probiotics. Thank you Happybellies!"

All the grocery stores including Central Market and Whole Foods were completely out of the Earth's Best, and I don't really like the Gerber organic.  My baby was exclusively breast fed for the first six months, and I felt like this was the best transition to solids.  I also like that it's brown rice.  I feel good about giving it to my baby, and he likes it!"

The company was open and informative with me.(1.800.398.1600) I'll not be feeding my dogs ANYTHING that comes out of China unless we go flat broke. Many foods(pet & people) say ""Made in America"" but most of the ingredients are from foreign countries and the food is only pressed together and packaged here. I consider this dishonest and immoral. It's also obviously legal thanks to federal policy that favors 'Free-trade/profit' over the health of American children, much less their pets. A premium food, sans fillers and trash, really is no more expensive since you feed less of it. Your dog will be healthier. Call this company and other companies and ask about their ingredients. Science diet and Purina will, for good reason, be way more evasive than Canidae."

I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots.  There are many, many complaints on the web by people with dogs having the same symptoms that finally stopped upon changing to another food.  Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only).  There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list.  Do your homework before buying this dog food.  Dog owners across the country have spent lots of money unnecessarily at the vets trying to find answers to their dogs medical problems only to find that it's the food they've been feeding.  Used to be an outstanding product!  Wish I could give zero stars!"

Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom."

He is a powerful, obsessive chewer that tore anything else apart that we gave him. He's been through many over the years. Recently, on a routine visit to the vet, they found that both of his molars on top were cracked & infected. They are currently performing root canals on each. If the root canals do not work,they'll have to pull his most important chewing teeth. The vet (who is a dental specialist) said that the injuries were directly related to this product.

08	19569,B000084ETV,A1H7CKOA2DQJU0,8/17/08,20,23,1,WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae."

We bought a regular Nylabone and it was completely destroyed within a couple minutes.  Huge pieces were torn out of it and swallowed.  I was terrified he would have serious ramifications from it.  I contacted Nylabone immediately and they sent me 3 toys more suitable for my ""strong chewer"".  One of those was the dental dinosaur durables.  He LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy.  And after 4 months it is now time to replace it (the head and tail are now missing).  I am so please that this toy worked for our pirana dog! :)<br /><br />Other good toys that they sent as replacements were the Nylabone Wishbone and the Nylabone Puzzel Bone."

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings.

Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.

We now give this to him one or two times a day (he is 7 months now) and often mix it with apples, or pear, or other foods too.  He really enjoys this and I like that it has probiotics. It does seem like a large amount of creal in one order, esp if you aren't sure if your child will like it. But if you plan to feed cereal to your baby while supplementing with other solid foods, I would say this is one of the best rice cereals available."

The label says this may happen...it's a shame that so much packaging is wasted, though.<br /><br />Tip: We saved the scoop from his formula and use it to measure the cereal from the cannister."

I was wary of Nylabone products after that, but the durable ones have turned out to be great, and I'll only buy durable from now on.  My dogs like the bone-shaped durable Nylabones, but they LOVE these dinosaurs.  They never seem to get tired of chomping on them.  They do wear down, but slowly and in tiny pieces that appear to be harmless.  After about a month of three dogs working on two dinosaurs, the toys are missing their heads, but there's plenty more to chew on.  Their irregular shape makes them easy to hold onto and fun to go at from different angles.  My house will never be without these things."

However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas.<br />*********<br /><br />I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.

Our dogs are chihuahua mix, and showed no interest in the dino-chews. They were too big and too ""strong"" of a chew for them. Luckily, my sister has a lab-mix, who seems to enjoy it thoroughly. These are really best for dogs that normally destroy their chewies within minutes. Otherwise, they are durable and cute."

Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a ""hot spot"" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an ""allergic reaction.""  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems."

They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open.

Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal, though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this brand."

He's a year old and we mixed this cereal with his formula and it was like magic.  He's not gassy, eats his entire bottle in 5-10 minutes, has regular BMs and is much more happy.  I've never been into organic stuff before but a friend recommended this and I would never use anything else.  I really believe the probiotics have had a positive result on my son.

This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon."

Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.

I just reread this on 12/01/2010 and it comes out to 43 cents a bar because the 12 pack is $31.09. I still think you should purchase these in your local grocery store.

I previously fed them Purina One, switched to Blue Buffalo in Dec 06, then Canidae in Feb 07 (food scare for Blue Buffalo). I am very particular about what I give my dogs: dog of 10yrs died/cancer and had 2 knee replacements due to arthritis/joint issues. My Dogs are doing great on Canidae. I just spoke w/ Canidae less than 2 mins ago and they HAVE NOT changed their product at all. I read the review from the person that once gave this product a great review and now thinks the product has changed due to her dogs' digestive issues (or something like that).  I left a msg for Canidae about 20 mins ago, and they already called me back at work to answer my questions (unlike Blue during the food scare).  If you have seen a blog concerning something about Acetaminophen being in Canidae, that is false. Some lady said she had Canidae and some other foods tested by putting them in a baggie together...blah blah, any way it was a false allegation but the internet spreads rumors like wildfire. I drive 2 hrs to re-stock on Canidae. Highly recommend."

Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />""Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.""<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />""We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.""<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The ""Canidae Team"" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?"

My dachshund-mix 3-month-old puppies were not too interested in the classic nylabone so I got these, and they just LOOOVE them. It's their #1 chew-toy. They can sit in their beds and chew on it forever. I also recommend the Nylabone fish. For some reason the funky shapes and textures are just much more enticing than the regular bone shape. One more note: to get them really hooked on Nylabones I've found that I have to hold the toy for them to chew on at first (so they build really positive associations with it: bone='mom'), at the beginning of a chewing session, and then they're hooked. Don't necessarily expect your dog to just chew it without any of your involvement. The more you're involved, the more he'll enjoy it!"

And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."

Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat."

It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."

They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy.

Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
08	78583,B00472I5A4,A324FVIOYCWNSB,7/5/08,0,0,4,An addictive potato chip,Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.  Good and salty.

08	78581,B00472I5A4,A3I96LKK3S15D0,7/13/08,0,0,5,Box-o-Chips,"These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected."
08	78580,B00472I5A4,A1DOBB5XZ1KMZ5,7/25/08,0,0,5,Fabulous!,"These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!"
08	78579,B00472I5A4,A3UCO7B9HP42BG,7/27/08,0,0,5,Great chips,"We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!"
08	78578,B00472I5A4,A3MLESXA2VGWJC,7/29/08,0,0,4,Best sour cream & onion chip I've had,"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."
08	78577,B00472I5A4,A339FKUBFG0VLX,7/29/08,0,0,4,Yummy chips,"These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving."
08	78576,B00472I5A4,A31N6KB160O508,8/26/08,0,0,4,Pretty good tasting chip,It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.
08	78575,B00472I5A4,A17UR3NRLARXCH,9/10/08,0,0,4,"Good chips, more cheese","They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime."
08	78574,B00472I5A4,A3B0HXAUWCLSZO,9/14/08,0,0,5,By far my favorite chips,"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close."
08	43430,B0000DJDHN,A22L9K0Z2MPAY4,3/30/08,4,4,5,Great Tasting 2 Carb Cookie,"Joseph's makes an entire line of sugar-free cookies that are just 2 carbs per cookie (about 1 1/2"" in diameter).  My personal favorites on the different flavors are Lemon, Oatmeal and Almond.  All three of these are delicious, especially as a dessert while watching carbs - there is nothing in their taste that even hints at ""artificial sweetener"".  Other flavors are Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter (sort of bland), Pecan Shortbread (more along the line of a Pecan Sandie rather than an actual shortbread).  The cookies are delicious, but because of the size, low-carb dieters will need to have good self-discipline in order to keep the actual carb count down when eating them."
08	86249,B000084E6V,A162K7K0O8G0AD,6/10/08,1,1,5,Best for my dog,"We could never give my dog anything cloth like or soft because she would chew on it or take out the stuffing of her bed or blanket. With toys it was the same. We bought her a Kong(r) but she didn't take to it even with several treats stuffed on the inside. Then I bought this hoping it would be a good toy for her. She didn't take to it right away but eventually it became her favorite. Anytime she's bored or just need to chew we'll give her this and she'll be busy for about ten minutes. The toy itself is very tough not flexible at all which is what we needed. Its easy to clean too, we just run it under some hot water for a couple of seconds or so. Great for bored dogs or some really aggressive chewers. The only thing is I didn't get to pick the dinosaur...darn!... but that's not going to affect it's rating it's still a great chew toy overall."
08	29755,B000X98Z5A,A2QJ72O7IFRWQ2,11/15/08,3,3,5,Favorite treat,"We have been giving our 12 year old Yorkie the greenies for several years.  My husband found the senior version a few months ago and now our little old dog is hooked on these.  They are just soft enough for him to chew and really enjoy, and hard enough that it still takes awhile."
08	51865,B001EO5XVC,A1VHN6QUNSFB5W,9/9/08,0,0,5,Tastes Like Coffee,"I've been buying this coffee from a local store chain for about 5 years and it is one great coffee! It is always satisfying, has a nice finish..which is that ""aftertaste"" you get. The coffee folks like to call it finish.. What's really nice is that the price is always lower than the other organic brands. I've served the decaf to friends and they raved about it afterwards. A great value for an outstanding product."
08	59303,B000Q0IMOK,A2C93EL5HNEG08,12/21/08,7,7,5,Unbelieveably good.,"I bake.  A lot.  Everyone looks for my baked goods at the holidays, but no one was expecting the chocolate cake made with Pernigotti.  Another reviewer commented about the rich aroma when the bag is opened, and she's right. The cocoa is a beautiful reddish-brown, and has the richest, most delightful smell ever. The only cocoa I found that remotely reminds me of this one is Schokinag. I found this at Williams-Sonoma, but it's priced much better here, even with shipping.  The only thing I have to say, to those who are not aware that there is a difference between Dutch Process and regular cocoa, is that you have to either watch the recipes you use it in or find a way to modify the recipe you have. I did the latter for the chocolate cake and it was wonderful. My brownies, which don't need modification came out so perfect that no one could believe that just changing the cocoa made that much of a difference.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product, and had I not bought enough from WS to last the holidays, I would be buying this last one available now. Someone needs to snatch it up quick!"
08	59304,B000Q0IMOK,A1TQN8PND2YEH3,10/14/08,5,5,5,Sinfully Delicious,"I am a hot chocolate connoisseur and have tried many different cocoa powders and drink mixes.  This has to be one of the best I have ever tried.  The second you open the bag, the most intense chocolate scent wafts up to you nose. Try that with regular cocoa.  I take the powder, add a few of my own spices and then I enjoy it for breakfast all winter.  I haven't ever made cookies or anything else with it, but I imagine it would be just as delicious in those recipes as well."
08	19593,B000084ETV,A3KZG8XNX5P4HR,8/18/08,6,7,1,Canidae Dog Food made my dogs extremely ill,"I have relied on Canidae for my 4 dogs for over 3 years now. It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.  Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill.  I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on."
08	19594,B000084ETV,A2VZIJHABHMIQW,8/7/08,6,7,1,Canidae made my dogs VERY SICK,"New food and or changed formula's need to be introduced to animals slowly. Very slowly. However, I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.  By the way, what WAS wrong with the old formula????"
08	19595,B000084ETV,A2A4V2TRW08GC4,8/12/08,8,10,1,Hot spots galore while on Canidae,"I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing."

The new and improved Greenies are much softer than the earlier variety and I give them to my terrier as a special treat. She loves them more than any other treats. I like that they don't stain or leave any residue and they don't smell like some other dog treats. My other dog is indifferent to them so you might want to try the smaller package to see if you dog likes them or not."

Much easier to chew than old formula!!!,"My dog really loves these and she is old, so it really helps with keeping her teeth clean.  The original formula did cause a some dogs to have bowel obstructions and die in a very unpleasant way, but this is a new formula, easier to chew, but still helps keep the teeth clean.  They are not cheap, but my old girl absolutely lives for these things."

Then I tried this brand of oatmeal and they loved it. Next I tried this brand of rice and found they love it too, and this one agrees with them. I mix it with water and they gobble it up."

It gives him added calories and the benefit of probiotics in everything that he eats!  He is very regular; I think it is because of Happy Bellies cereal.  Thank you Happy Baby for another great product!  PS - The old cereal containers made great toys!  He loves to take the lid on and off and hide other toys inside :)!

In fact, I don't usually like candy with the occasional exception of Halloween and that moment when you just need something sweet.  But these little guys, watch out.  It might SEEM like a 12 pack is a lot, but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your vestal tongue.  A 12 pack will seem like there's a shortage of caramels in the world. LOL.<br /><br />I tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and I just can't.  To me it's like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like ""Ahhh, that's it.""<br /><br />I can only hope that the gubment doesn't put a tax on it like cigs because then I'd have to put myself into an institution."

The only thing we found is that the cereal had a weird after taste in one of the cans we used.  It could be a totally random issue.<br /><br />I am not personally a big fan of artificial sources of DHA, such as algae.  For mothers who are breastfeeding, breast milk is the best source of DHA and benefits of external sources of DHA are disputed.

The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.<br /><br />I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout."

We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best.

The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself. Why did I ever buy a whole case! Bless Amazon for carrying the Bahlsen line of fabulous cookies because it is not available in Montana.

I learned about the switch to new formulas from Canidae quite a while back but stuck with it. I have a German Shepard and a cat and both went through the switch just fine. What baffles me is how there can be so many great experiences listed here and then see those bad ones. I wonder if some of these innocent little dogs didn't have something else going on instead of getting bad food. Maybe it just doesn't work the same for everyone's dog. Anyway, my kids are very active for their age and doing great on Canidae and Felidae. It seems to be the best combination of high-quality ingredients and reasonable price out there. I'm a big fan and receommend both to anyone. In fact, my cat loves the new formula even more than the old. She's getting a little fat.  :-)"
08	19615,B000084ETV,A1RVOQQG6YYKLN,2/16/08,2,2,5,Fantastic,"My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.<br /><br />I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff."

08	78414,B000NMFXNY,A252265V3QWSF4,9/15/08,5,5,5,5th Avenue is #1,"5th Avenue candy bars are truly one of the best out there.  Far superb to the oh-so-sugary, too-sweet Butterfinger, the 5th Avenue takes the combination of peanut butter and chocolate and adds a satisfyingly audible ""crunch"" to the whole affair - without the interruption that comes from using whole nuts in the bars, as you may notice in Snickers or Baby Ruth's.<br /><br />No, 5th Avenue's distinguish themselves from Butterfingers in the fact that they maintain some semblance of the flavor of peanut butter within their golden centers. Butterfinger seems to content itself with stirring sugar water with a small dollop of peanut butter (and perhaps some food coloring, I'd dare say) before coating the confection with a thin layer of chocolate.<br /><br />5th Avenue, on the other hand, does the lovers of the peanut butter and chocolate combination true justice. Your teeth will glide through the thick, milk chocolate coating before they are but momentarily halted at the crunchy (though not nutty) peanut buttery center; each rapturous bite offers such satisfaction that you will hardly want to have to wait to swallow one before greedily taking another.<br /><br />This review was written by a lover of other chocolate/peanut-buttery delights as: Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (regular or bite-sized), Nutty Butty Bars, Reese's Pieces, chocolate cookies with peanut butter chips, Buckeyes, and peanut butter pie with chocolate shell crust, and S'mores (you must add peanut butter to your grahams for the perfect S'more, y'know)."

The texture and color seem different and my dog won't eat them at all.  I don't know if this is a one time thing or the change is permanent.  I am very, very disappointed. The other treats I bought at the same time are the same, or at least she eats them sometimes.<br />So I probably won't be purchasing the dumbbells again, especially since the price has gone from under $30 to $40...<br />Thanks<br />Marye"

Two-thirds of a cup doesn't sound like a lot, but with this stuff and 1/2 C of skim milk, it's a decent serving.<br /><br />If you're on Weight Watchers, this will fit right in: a serving with skim milk is only 4 points -- not bad for a nice filling breakfast.  Add some fresh fruit, and you're set to go.<br /><br />Amazon's price is quite good, too.  This stuff is sky high in the supermarket if you can find it.  Yes, you have to buy 5 packages, but a little goes a long way -- I have it 2-3 times a week, and I'm not getting tired of it at all.<br /><br />All in all, a good value: healthy, filling, and great taste."

The only downside is since the ingredients are so dense, the packages are small, but a serving size is only 2/3 cup-honestly I eat more than that as one serving though. The best value for this brand is the 21 oz. Swiss Crunch which is heavenly w/ assorted grains, coconut, hazelnuts, and raisins.

It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right."

I cannot determine the true source of their oil, but each of the three bottles I purchased had a very acidic bite to it: either the oil was rancid or simply of very poor quality. Good oil will have a smooth buttery quality to it --- you can sip olive oil with the same delicateness of palate as you would wine. This oil however completely fails this test."

I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.

I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it."

This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price."

08	19646,B000084ETV,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,8/31/08,3,4,1,CHANGE IN FORMULA MAKES DOGS SICK!!!!!,"If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the ""customer service representative"" if you can call her that, simply said ""if you don't like it then don't buy it."" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any ""stickers"" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it."

08	55198,B000KAKZ2I,A85IGR4AZSPRL,3/3/08,1,1,5,Doggie Crack,"I bought a single Greenies Tennie for my puppy, just to see if she likes it. Surprisingly enough, she loves it. At first she just licks it curiously, then she started to grab it and take it to a corner and start licking and chewing on it. It keeps her busy for a long time. It's good for her teeth and make her have a better chewing habbit than chewing table legs and my fingers. I went out to my local pet stores to get this big pack. They price is actually the same as Amazon, I wish amazon would have this product for cheaper though.<br />But if you want your dog to be busy, help them to have better teeth, curing chewing habbit and ease seperation anxiety, you need to give this a try.<br /><br />But of course you need to becareful choosing the right size. If the treat is too small, when they woof it down, they might get chocked. The teenie is right size for my Mini American Eskimo puppy because she is really small now. When she is older I will switch to a size bigger."

No different from regular grocery dog food.,"I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc."

Freshness may be an issue, because on opening the bag, I was not greeted with the strong aroma that is typical of freshly roasted beans.<br /><br />The price is right at about $6.00 a pound delivered. I may try another Boyers blend of a more robust nature.<br /><br />This blend is considerably milder than Starbuck's house blend.<br /><br />A major disappointment!<br /><br />I tried Boyer's ""Rocky Mountain Thunder"" which I found was much more to my taste.

He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.<br /><br />You get eight cans of Ocean Whitefish & Tuna Feast; eight more cans of Savory Salmon Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sole & Shrimp Feast. Very good!<br /><br />The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.<br /><br />If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too."

We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points<br />indicated ""Don't like this one"".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee."

It tastes like a candy bar and provides enough fiber, protein, etc. to replace a meal.  I think it's a great way to help me lose weight."

However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew. The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried. In general, I prefer to buy pods from Timothy's World Coffee. The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view. I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid. I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup. If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts, try this blend."

I've given up on anything with refined sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. You have no idea how difficult it is to find healthy, mass-produced snacks that don't contain either of these. But Kashi GOLEAN Turtle Rolls are made with brown rice syrup. They're great for packing into a back pack. Even when they get squished, they're still easy to eat. And they tasted good, too. These are incredibly difficult to find in my local grocery store and market so I buy a case or two from Amazon every other month and keep one at home and one at the office for days when I can't make it out to lunch. With a glass of milk, the Kashi GOLEAN Turtle rolls is great for tiding me over 'til dinner."
08	55184,B000EFBMA8,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,1/24/08,2,2,5,Mmmm!,"Just through basic experimenting, I've also found that adding diced up imitation crab to this 'box mix' creates a great recipe. I then like adding a little chopped up tomato, black beans, and guacamole.<br /><br />It does not look like a lot from the box, but wow, a little bit of this dish really fills me up. It's definitely a good buy if you have to stretch a meal for a couple of days."

The box comes with two air tight packs which is good for keeping them fresh, but like many GF foods it's not a really full box.  If you expecting an amount similar to a full box of ritz it's not even close.  But compared to other GF foods the price is comparable to similar crackers."

They are not so fond of it, but will eat if there is nothing else.  Also, they will only eat it as soon as a can is opened, there is no hope of putting half a can in tupperware and feeding it to them later. Oh, yeah, and STINKY.

08	56427,B000EHL21U,AH72FCWO4AZ5V,4/5/08,0,1,5,Kashi Go Lean Turtle ROLL!,This bar is great for breakfast with coffee.  The pecans and caramel give the nouget a multidimensional flavor.  It feels like negative calorie intake with all of the chewing required to eat the bar.  This is a good thing as it makes you feel like you've really eaten something.  The optimized glycemic response also helps if you need an afternoon pick me up.

This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!"

These days (2008), Starburst remains an incredibly popular choice amongst tweens. In an effort to draw in more tween consumers, candy companies are offering new creations of old favorites, such as Wrigley's creation of life saver flavored gummi candy, called gummi-saversLife Savers Gummies, Fun Sized Bag, 5 Flavors, 13-Ounces (Pack of 6).<br /><br />Unlike Gummi-Savers, which have remained popular, most of these candy creations usually disappear from shelves after a couple of years (such are lifesaver-holes). I think this candy (Starburst gummi-chews) may go the way of the lifesaver-hole. First, they don't taste anything like Starburst. Second, the liquid candy filling is too sweet. Basically these taste like gummi savers with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMK48W"">Fruit Gushers Variety, 12-Count Value Pack (Pack of 6)</a>gushers filling."

I won't be ordering from them again because I don't trust them. Who knows if you will get your order or not. Sorry fellows, but you won't stay in business doing stuff like this."
08	55183,B000EFBMA8,A24Z9QHATPLTD5,5/5/08,3,3,5,"A surprisingly good ""box meal""","In an effort to have something ""quick and easy"" on hand and as one who basically lives on white meat chicken, I tried this box mix not expecting much more than some flavored rice to accompany my otherwise boring white meat chicken.  Since I often buy bulk boneless skinless chicken, frozen, it seems that I never have the forethought to defrost the chicken for a meal.  However, I've found that while I cook the frozen chicken in a frying pan, just a tiny drop of oil, on low, it's like steaming the chicken...no additives, just plain chicken. While the chicken is ""cooking"" I prepare the box mix (without adding the chicken like the box says) - the simmer time on the mix is just about the same time it takes for the chicken to cook - I cube the chicken still in the cooking pan (to ensure it's fully cooked post freezer), toss it into the now finished box mix - saves lots of time as I never have anything defrosted when I need it :)<br /><br />Like others, I have experimented and added frozen corn (much better than canned I've found) - now my staple in this ""mix"", plus I sometimes add shredded cheese atop it before serving. I've tried the diced tomatoes and peppers...not a big fan.  I always top with a dab of sour cream.<br /><br />The mix freezes very well and reheats with ease.  I tend to add a sprinkling of water when microwaving for some extra moisture in the rice.  A leftover favorite is a flour tortilla with the mix, sour cream and a dash of taco sauce.<br /><br />Friends to whom I've served this mix have been shocked it was indeed a ""mix"" (that is, when I've confessed!)...not your typical flavorless or overpriced ""helper mix""!"

True, it has a spicy hot flavor - but the hotness never overpowers the wonderful flavor this sauce emparts.  Terrifically versatile, I've used it on beef and chicken - even in soups! So if you're looking for a hearty, rich-flavored sauce with a hotness that won't melt your molars, give this one a taste. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Truly exceptional."

I heat up a can of refried beans and then make burritos by putting about 1/4 cup of refried beans, 1/4 cup of the enchilada filling and a tablespoon or two of picante sauce on a flour tortilla and then rolling up burrito style.

Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from ""xylan hemicellulose"" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

You taste each distinctive flavor all at once. We bought 2 boxes and managed to make them last 4 days (not easy considering how light they are) and tried them with coffee, hot tea and milk. All good but my preference is the hot tea. A great afternoon treat.<br />The only drawback is that you pay shipping per box and the shipping is higher than the cookies, but still worth it."

The primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika, but overall the tastes are muddled and don't provide a 'zing' to the dish.<br /><br />It's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price.  It is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken, fish, or to drizzle over a meat-pasta dish.<br /><br />Note: Surprisingly, the best pairings from Chef Tom for red meats are either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5NKUK"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Pork Rub</a> or a generous portion of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>."

Any lover of dark chocolate would adore this stuff. Part of the overall experience is the struggle to actually just sip it. After the first taste, the instinct is to gobble it up. Take it slow. Make it last. Every small sip is a flavor explosion, like a crumb of Maytag Blue Cheese."

When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled ""specially selected for Wegman's.""

This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.

The taste is definitely great and this oil is much more flavorful than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHR2MU"">Bertolli Extra Light Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a>.  Extra virgin olive oil is much tastier for salads or simple recipes than the light olive oil.<br /><br />Of course you have to make sure you are getting the proper oil for your needs and recipes.  Sometimes the light olive oil is called for by certain recipes.  Some people also need to use *light* for health reasons. Olive oil is generally considered to be healthy so those people should be the exception.<br /><br />The other thing to keep in mind is the price.  This is one of those products where it really pays to subscribe.  It's on the expensive side anyway, but subscribing makes it more bearable.<br /><br />You can never have too much high quality olive oil when you love to cook.  This stuff gets used quickly.  So even though it's a nice sized bottle don't be afraid to subscribe!<br /><br />Enjoy!"

I brewed according to directions, and uploaded a photo above to show you the gorgeous amber tea and the huge leaves, nicely plumped from the hot water.

May they never stop making them! But while the cookie itself rates a five-star plus, I was sent an entire case of packages whose sell-by date expired several weeks before they were shipped. One-Star-Minus for the warehouse shippers! That said, the response to my complaint was not only a complete and unequivocal refund, but zipped back to me only minutes after my grumpy email. Five stars to Customer Care Department. So it should average a 3+ but no fractional stars are permitted."

The carb level is less than 1grm for you somersizers that means you aren't combining your proteins and bad carbs.  Hard to find and a little pricey to ship, but worth it."

Superb! In addition, stir in a can of beans and/or vegetables, and one packet could easily feed a family of four. Surprisingly low-calorie, the flavor is complex and a welcome change. I'll definitely buy this again."

For dinner, I supplement with fresh spinach, chick peas and sometimes chicken sausage before I heat and eat!  A very satisfying dinner when supplemented, and even with spinach and 1/2c chick peas, only 5 points!<br /><br />I love this tasty bite because it is low-fat, low-cal, and extremely high flavor!  Doesn't taste like diet food, and it isn't.  It's just wholesome and good for you!"

It is soupy but if you let it sit for a few minutes after removing the pouch from the boiling water, it thickens nicely. I serve it over Casbah Couscous. This is something I crave at times and nothing else will do. Our fav Tasty Bite is Jaipur Vegetables, but we also stock this Lentil one as well as the Peas Paneer and Paneer Makhani. I love that the ingredients in Tasty Bite are healthy, and it is great to have Indian cuisine in a convenience food. Amazon sells out of many of these, but you check tastybite for singles and cases, they also have free shipping with $50, which is fine if you buy cases of several varieties."

They are her final treat of the day and she can hardly wait for them. After eating her food she jumps up on the chair and stares at me or if I don't see her she barks at me until she gets my attention so I can look and see she ate her food. Then she runs over to the closet waiting for me to give her one. I wish I could be so  easily placated and satisfied."

And with my food allergy problem, I was excited to find them. I normally get the rounds, which are terrific with my Manchego cheese.  So this time around I tried the crispy thins and the Harvest whole wheat. The Harvest whole wheat closely resembles triscuits.  A good thing.  However I'm disappointed they are so salty.  I would've strongly preferred less or no salt.  I'm perplexed about why a supposed healthy cracker would be so salty. So I won't be ordering this one again. Which is a bummer."

I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS.

He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.<br /><br />You get eight cans of Sliced Chicken Hearts & Liver Feast; eight more cans of Sliced Turkey Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sliced Beef Feast. They also come with gravy flavoring--very good!<br /><br />The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.<br /><br />If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too."

We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good."

Weak tasting coffee. Bought the Keurig based on Amazon reviews and liked it from the first. Now I love it, because I found a dark, deeply satisfying roast that makes my day. Full on coffeehouse flavor with no bitter aftertaste. It's one of three featured varieties in our office-- Timothy's Breakfast Blend, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast. We have all three on subscription and they're a hit with both staff and client partners. BTW, my personal choice is almost always this one."

I think this salt is wonderful on fish and beef.  I was very pleased with my order from DAS Salt/DAS Foods - fast shipping, great product, pleasant thank you note and samples included with my order.

Not great, but not a problem at all.  It's considerably milder than McCormick's.  So, to compensate, depending on what I'm making, I simply modify the quantity of spice.  I use about 50% more of this than I would with McCormick's PP Spice.  In any case, this brand is so inexpensive, it's still a good bargain.  And the flavor is great!!!  Just know that it is a little bit mild, and it will work great for you!"

Also, this one is available in the 6-box lots while the Lipton Green Tea is only in a 12-box lot.  It will become a staple for you with lemon and honey (lime, orange peel, etc.)<br /><br />Green tea is also an extremely healthy drink with all the special polyphenol antioxidants that it contains.  It may even prevent Alzheimers disease.  (Black tea is dried which destroys a percentage of the antioxidants.) Although green tea also contains a small amount of caffeine it has another calming effect that is almost a high in itself.  Over a year ago, we quit coffee in the AM to go to green tea and have never looked back.

Personally, if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea, it is too overpowering for me to drink. I like to drink an aromatic tea, not a cup of perfume. The Rishi Earl Grey tea is described as ""bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus."" I think that sums it up very well. I was a little concerned when I popped the lid on the tin, as the scent was very powerful.  However, it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth. I can taste a high quality, rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tones.<br /><br />I also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a Fair Trade Certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees. It's organic as well as Kosher. Rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times, so this tea is also very economical. I'll definitely be trying more Rishi teas."

I appreciate the fact that it is organic. That is always a major factor in my food purchases. The beautiful long leaves were impressive. I don't care for the fragrance of bergamot to dominate, I would say it was well balanced in this tea, but somehow the overall flavor was...nice.<br /><br />For this company and price, I expected an Ooh & Ahh moment upon inhaling the fragrance and taking the first sip. Their silver needle jasmine was exquisite.<br /><br />In a blind taste test, Twinnings humble tea bag would clobber it."

But then I tasted it and all hesitations were put to rest. It is mild yet not bland, rich and creamy yet not cloying, and has a fullness that is both satisfying and addicting. I usually like to sprinkle a little Fleur de Sel or coarse sea salt over unsalted butter, but didn't even consider it with this; it would have interfered with its luscious, subtle taste. We made this package last as long as we could and were sorry to see it go."

Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road."

These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list ""high fructose corn syrup"" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does.

Now I've discovered on my own how to do it RIGHT.<br /><br />  If you want perfect popcorn, here's my secret:<br />- Add 2-3 ounces of oil in popper + 3 kernels;<br />- On electric stove (yeah, I know) set burner between 8 and 9 on scale of 1 to 10. (If you set it for 10, you'll have small, lousy, and even unpopped results. Who knew!)<br />- When the 3 kernels pop, add 1/3 cup of kernels (any more than this and they'll spill over)<br />- Meanwhile, melt 1/4 to 1/3 of ONE cube of butter in microwave for 35 seconds.<br />- When popped, (turn the whirley handle to prevent popped corn from overheating / or shake your pot (the one on the stove) if you lack this popper) and pour into your favorite bowl, (don't put butter into your popcorn cooker) drizzling butter and sprinkling a smidgen of salt.<br /><br />  The very best you've ever had . . . true?<br /><br />Another Tip: I deliberately make extra, putting the rest into a FoodSaver airtight canister. It stays genuinely fresh throughout the week.<br /><br />  P.S. I'm just a happy customer. I don't sell popcorn. (But now I eat too much of it.)"

Pretty good."

It's got a great cherry taste to it that is not overpowering with just a hint of berry flavor thrown in for good measure. Let it steep about three minutes and you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains all-natural ingredients; and there are no artificial ingredients. The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a cherry flavored tea with a slight berry twist to it, I highly recommend this tea! Enjoy!"

Simply perfect. It's not overly sweet, the blueberries aren't wimpy, and the texture of the flakes is wonderfully crisp and hearty.<br /><br />I am sharing this with my mom and dad, who need a cereal with lots of fiber and good taste, and they love it, too. Considering how picky my dad is, that's quite a testimonial.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

In addition to great taste, it's got a great texture, doesn't get all soggy when you put milk on it.  With the $20 off $49 special going on Amazon during July 08, it's a good deal to buy from Amazon too.  Stock up while it is on special cause chances are it will stock out soon with the current special offer.  It is easily one of my favorite cereals along with a few other Kashi products.

I like most (NOT all) of Kashi products, so this cereal sounded great. I'm big on crunchy, but this flake is over the top! It's not only crunchy, it has minute pieces of something (grain?) in each flake that was too hard for a cereal. The taste was fine, it was just too hard to chew, and I don't like to let it soak to soften, then it's mush. The fruit in it was delish, tho!"

You can get the same results with a good food processor (i.e. a Kitchen Aid). This is NOT a fine, even grind.  If I sift the product, I find a lot of chunks.  I want a fine EVEN grind when using nut meal/flour (the terms are used interchangeably in the industry) as the main or only flour in my baked goods.<br /><br />Since this brand is easy to find in many supermarkets, I do recommend it for some uses.  It's good for folks who don't do mail order, those non-GF cooks looking to lower the carb count of their bread coatings, and those looking for an easy GF or a no-carb ""breading"" option, but only when a coarse coating is suitable. For instance I like fine coatings if I'm going to ""pan fry"" a white/light flesh fish fillet.<br /><br />When used as the main or only flour for baking, the batter will look lumpy and the finished product will taste a bit gritty. It won't perform well in some recipes because the chunkier nature of the grind will affect the way the batter handles moisture, which could result in a dense rather than light texture.  It could also yield products that fall severely upon cooling.<br /><br />In order words, disappointing outcomes might not be the recipe or your culinary technique, it could be your choice in ingredients!"

I'm enjoying making ""soba"" with this flour on each weekend.<br />This flour is not ""sa-ra-si-na"" (in Japanese) that is a flour using the most inner starch rich part, but ""ichiban ko"" (1st grade flour) or ""nami ko"" (general purpose flour).  ""Soba"" from this flour becomes ""Edo mae"" (Tokyo style).  If this has little bit more of inner skin (or pellicle), I can make ""Inaka soba"" (country style), I like more than ""Edo mae""."

Does anything really help though?! :)  I do recommend these because of the great taste, but try snapping them in two if your cat has trouble vomiting after gulping his/her food."

I have a Senseo, so sometimes it works better to put one pod in the two pod receiver, then press the one cup water despenser. These pods seem to be a little thicker. However, a little thicker probably means more coffee."

08	77916,B000EMOBVI,A1P9UHDKMV913D,10/19/08,0,0,5,Best Ever!,This is the best pasta salad I've ever eaten!  I don't like the kinds with mayonnaise and the majority of the mixes call for mayo. Caeser for some reason is hard to find in the stores. I use olive or coconut oil and sometimes add chopped tomatoes.  Delicious!!  I could eat it every day.
08	77913,B000EMOBVI,A3M8R4JD1SIS76,6/18/08,2,2,5,We like that Caesar Taste,"We like the taste of Caesar salad, and this one is a big hit.  When we are in a hurry and don't have time to make everything from scratch, it is convenient to make something tasty like Suddenly Caesar Salad.  Usually we add olive oil instead of vegetable oil.<br /><br />There's a suggestion on the box for creamy Caesar salad. It calls for mayonnaise and milk.<br /><br />Sometimes we add some romaine and chicken.  It's also good with crawfish tails, leftover broiled salmon, or shrimp."

As far as I'm concerned espressos are for those shoppers with ten items or less.  Just pour me a cup of rich, hot coffee, brewed in a Mr. Coffee or a Bunn.  And if the coffee being brewed is FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, I know I'm going to enjoy every drop.<br /><br />Folgers, an American fixture in kitchen pantries for generations, boasts about its mountain grown coffees.  I know this because Mrs. Olsen told me (and you oldtimers will know what I'm talking about).  Thing is, there's nothing better in the morning than waking up to the rich aroma of Folgers Classic Roast brewing in the coffee maker; it's one of the most recognizable aromas to stir the olfactories.  Folgers makes a variety of blends, but I prefer the Classic Roast; as a lifelong Folgers drinker the classic is the same brand I enjoyed as a young whippersnapper.  Yet on the high tech side, Folgers has the unique interlocking AromaSeal that preserves freshness. . .sans can openers.  The easy grip handles are pretty. . .handy, too.<br /><br />So pay through the noggin for lima bean espresso if that floats your boat; I'll take my can of FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, thank you very much.  This stuff is good--good to the last drop.  Where have I heard that before?<br />--D. Mikels, Esq."

Sadly, Chicken of the Sea is not a good quality albacore tuna.<br /><br />These days, I buy albacore because ""regular"" canned tuna smells so strong,it makes me want to gag. (Think cheap cat food.)  It tastes too fishy, and is filled with less than desirable pieces. (Skin, etc.) Albacore contains ""cleaner"" meat chunks and I rarely ever see any bad bits in the can. It's paler in color and has a much more desirable flavor.<br /><br />Growing up, my Mom always bought ""regular"" tuna, (as opposed to albacore) and I never remember it smelling as strong as ""regular"" tuna does now. I've tried many different brands, and I've finally realized that I have to move to the pricier albacore for a better ""tuna"" experience.<br /><br />This Chicken of the Sea Albacore is very watery, (more to drain off) and the consistency in the can is ""loose."" (As opposed to ""chunky"") It seems more processed than other brands. It has a stronger odor and taste than I prefer, and this will keep me from buying it again."

I don't have a problem with him vomiting at all.  I give him about 8-10 treats per day (and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach), and the hairballs pass through his system - he never spits them up.  I used to purchase them at the store, but they stopped carrying this specific type and only sell the hairball/tartar control combo ones now - my cat hates them.  So happy to find these online!"

I jumped on a deal with mixed results.<br /><br />Taste - this is one of my picks for this type of noodle ( Udon )thicker type.  It is on the spicy side.  Yes, have to agree it is seafood but a blended taste.  The dried seaweed / dried little fish disks ( like those imitation crab legs made of ground fish sticks )gives it more appeal.<br /><br />Delivery - I write this because you'll get noodle that are crushed on both sides.  I cringe at the thought of the other box I haven't opened yet.  Basically, your product condition is your selling point.  The problem is somehow in delivery or I suspect before boxing, the noodles are crushed so you end up something along the lines of a pill capsule shape.  Every one opened so far and these are along the edge of the box not the center yet.  When the significant other opened one and said said it was crushed, I thought well, time to post this so no one else is surprised."

Well I was a bit disappointed when I received this powder.  The reason I wanted true granules is that they retain the garlic flvor much longer than powder.  In the year or so that it will take me to use this, i think the flavor will be gone - unlike true granulated garlic which holds the flavor much longer.  Fool me once -- but don't get fooled again."

This is an excellent product, very convenient to prepare."

Well, truthfully, you can mix chocolate with anything and I will be happy!!!!<br />This has a good chocolate flavor as well as a peanut butter taste.  It's a good combination.<br />I don't like it spead on bread, so I use graham crackers or a butter cookie.  But, with all honesty, I'm a knife dipper!!!! But before you cringe, the whole jar is designated as mine, so I can get away with this.  Plus, if I offer anyone this type of Peanut Butter, I get a new jar for the company!!!<br />I liked it as it was described correctly.  I would have LOVED it if it only taste like chocolate.

The resulting brew did not disappoint; it was smooth and rich with a citrus tang.  I followed the directions exactly, pouring rapidly boiling water over a tablespoon of leaves placed in my infuser, and allowing it to steep for four minutes. The cup of tea was enhanced by the awareness that, in addition to enjoying the fine flavor, I was supporting an ethnic Chinese family by using an organic, Fair Trade Certified product.  It was a win-win situation - great tea and ecological balance.  (The package was even correct in promising that the leaves could withstand a second steep!)"

08	18603,B000F4H5F4,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6/7/08,4,4,4,The quintessential breakfast tea.,"Given this blend's orgin, the name ""English"" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name ""breakfast tea."" It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word ""English,"" which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday ""work horse,"" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee."

I was on this quest because I had never tasted another honey as good as that which was with the Fage yogurt, but I wanted to be able to buy plain Fage and add my own honey. When I tried adding the usual honey, it just didn't taste the same. So, I found out that this Attiki is the kind Fage uses, and I ordered it. It is truly heavenly.  It's expensive, but if you use it just for special treats, it's well worth it."

08	29974,B00015YTUQ,A3VLH7OCLQZ6DP,12/22/08,34,34,5,Made tasty popcorn,"I purchased this to make ""popcorn"", which I saw on Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods (Ethiopia episode, season three). I placed a small pot with a lid on medium-high heat with some canola oil. I added the sorghum, and then kept the kernels moving. Amazingly, they actually started popping. I half-expected them to simply burn, but they popped quite nicely. Sorghum kernels are very small, producing a miniature ""popcorn"" that is slightly larger than an unpopped popcorn kernel. Popped sorghum has a heavier, fuller taste than regular popcorn. Best of all, there are no kernel husks in the end result... just little fluffy popped sorghum. I experimented with popping different quantities and found that keeping the amount limited works best. With larger quantities, a significant number of the kernels did not pop. However, this wasn't all that bad... as the unpopped sorghum kernels were very delicious as well, not at all hard or crunchy. The unpopped kernels had a nice toasted flavor, a lot like corn nuts.<br /><br />Sorghum is one of those ""wonder grains"", that is used for everything from making sugar, molasses, animal feed, alcohol and biofuel. But, I now know that it makes a nice popcorn as well."

You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

08	30001,B000DZFMEQ,A3QAHX0VWAYXCU,4/19/08,1,1,5,Awesome!  Strongly recommend.,"I've taken the gluten-free baking classes from the CIA and, although you're taught to make good gluten-free bread, this is much better.  Simply because it is so quick & easy.  You don't have to worry about the bread rising.<br /><br />Make sure you use a mixer.  If you try to mix it by hand, the bread won't rise properly.  Additionally, the pizza dough is great with diced olives, homemade roasted red peppers, basil & garlic - all in the dough.<br /><br />Finally, I'm also allergic to corn, soy, beans, nuts, and a ton of other stuff. So, unless I make it myself, this is my only choice (other than some of the Namaste products)."

It smells yummy baking and the taste and consistancy makes a delicious sandwich.  It also makes great french toast.  This works great in a bread machine, which makes it super easy to make.  Every other bread we tried, gluten and wheat free, was dry and tasteless.  Give this one a try.  I don't think you will have to keep looking for a great gluten and wheat free bread.  You've found the best!"

This bread was easy to make, and baked up light and fluffy in the oven, almost like white flour bread would, only a little more moist. I added some hemp nuts, 2 tsp pizza spices and some onion powder.  The flavor was heavenly! The package has directions for all the uses it advertises and suggests ways to make specialty breads, e.g. herb bread, cinnamon bread, etc.  I'm very pleased with the product!"

I purchased the Stonewall Hot Pepper Jelly recently and was impressed.  I use it with butter on crumpets and muffins and often a small bit on a Ritz cracker and brie cheese.  That's good!  The flavor is sweeter than others I've tried but the spicy pepper flavor still jumps out and enhances the sugar on my tongue.  We'll serve it at our Superbowl party by warming slightly and pouring over a wedge of Brie placed on a wedge shaped triangular plate with crackers or those mini toasts."

The flavor was different than that of any other Earl Grey tea I've tried. This is the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 - basically it's not what I expected. Perhaps bergamot citrus was what set it apart from other companies. However though it's different it was very good. Tangy and flavorful, it seemed to get better with every sip. I don't usually add anything to the tea (no sugar, sweeteners, milk, etc.), but this tea in particular truly didn't need any additions. I am planning to try other teas from Rishi."

We love it so much, we have told several people about the Senseo and they have gotten them as well. This is a wonderful product and we waste a lot less coffee using the pods instead of making a pot of coffee. In fact, I think we drink a lot more coffee we want to try all the varieties of the Senseo coffee pods. Pair the pods with The Barista Blend flavor packs, sit back and enjoy."

The seller was listed as ABC Wholesale, and it is now listed as RED TAG sale, even though it's the exact same item.  Buy it from another source, it's a great tea.  I personally think it works great in combination with other teas, my favorite is a combination of four bags of this tea and one bag of plum black tea to make a gallon pitcher, which tastes great both hot or cold."

I'll let you know how this works out when it arrives.<br /><br />I guess if you just want to add powder to regular tea to make yourself feel better about the added health benefits this would be ok. If you hate the green twiggy matcha taste, this is ok.<br /><br />This is probably ok as ingredient grade. Or if you like iced tea...<br /><br />This is a sage green powder color ground very fine.<br />Tastes like ground BROWN tea.

I find that other brand flavored teas have such a wonderful aroma, however, the tea tends to be bitter--tasting nothing like the intended fruited flavor.  The Ahmad strawberry tea has a rich and smooth strawberry flavor, no matter how long I allow the tea bags to steep.  My family loves it as iced tea--as do I. We enjoy it so much, I make full, three-quart pitchers at a time and its always gone by the end of the day.  This year, I have already purchased four large boxes--20ct/6 bx--120 tea bags per box and now am purchasing the last of the 10 ct/12 bx box. I've gotten some great deals on here (as low as $.12 cent/tea bag)--on the internet, this tea runs $.18-.20/tea bag which adds up when you are buying 120-240 ct boxes."

I've tried the other ginger chews made by the ginger people, but these are far superior. I've had the ginger people chews for months and haven't come close to finishing the package. I've had the Reed's ginger candy for a couple of days and I've already finished my first pack. If you like ginger then you will really like these. I know it may be a splurge, but it's worth it. You get 20 packs with each package containing 10 individually wrapped candies. My only problem is going to be in pacing my consumption of this yummy treat."

They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).<br /><br />They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA."
08	83947,B000FNJ5JO,AWT5R0JHUACQ3,10/6/08,1,1,5,Good things come in small packages,When I first got this container of Matcha I thought it was a lot to pay for such a small container. Let me tell you..a little bit goes a long way! Matcha green tea is also much more flavourful than brewing tea from a teabag.  I have also found many recipes that call for green tea powder and this has worked out well. I would say the price I paid is well worth the wonderful matcha that I purchased.
08	58167,B000LKU3WY,A2V66VFSBPXPVM,5/27/08,13,13,4,WONDERFUL but....,"(My very first review...)<br /><br />What I got is different (but better) than the Reed's Ginger Candy picture. This yummy chews comes in a bulk-box of 20 small boxes, and each small box contain 10 candies making a total of 200 candies. Each candy / chew is wrap in an **edible** rice paper and then in a wax paper. I'm very impress with the whole packaging, and the edible rice paper is a nice surprise. I hate those inner-wrapper that comes with most candies making eating-candy a messy experience. The candies are very addictive. The only small complain I have is that the ginger-taste is too mild for me. If you are getting this for morning / motion sickness or migraine, this may not be a good choice. I would recommend crystallized ginger. Hopefully, the Reed's crystallized ginger candies are not this mild. My favor is W&M Ginger Glace but can't find it online."

08	5557,B000Y4145M,A19XBW5WUDH1Z,2/14/08,1,1,4,Dogs loved them,I have 3 chihuahuas and I thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear. They still were too much for the little guys. I would say a dog 20-30+ pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys.<br />They had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch. I don't know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural.<br />My chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them I was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them. They didn't have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them I just wouldn't buy them again since my guys are too small. The bags were a good size for the price. I bought three and should have bought one bag.<br />I rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion.
08	8740,B000LKZ84C,AKYYV4PLEJRJJ,7/8/08,27,29,4,"Great shelf life, very good for general use","I use this product frequently.  Like most tofu, you need to press it (between paper towels with a heavy skillet on top works fine) to get the excess water out.  The more water you can remove, the less you'll have to deal with sloppiness when cooking, something the previous reviewer did not like.<br /><br />As for a blank slate on taste, that's exactly what makes tofu great.  It will take on any flavor you want to impart.  Our most common marinade is placing the pressed, cubed tofu in a Ziploc with a mix of soy, honey, and lemon or lime juice.  A quick search online for a marinade will give you ideas (many also include minced garlic, ginger, etc).  You can also purchase a premade marinade, like a teriyaki sauce.  The more liquid the marinade (and the more water removed from pressing), the better it will penetrate the tofu.  Even a half hour in the bag works fine.<br /><br />We saute it right in the pan with the stir fry veggies (add tofu last--it just needs to get warm; or, for a firmer style, you can bake or ""brown"" it separately first) and pour in the remaining marinade as the final sauce (you can thicken with cornstarch if desired).  Handle the tofu cubes gently as they are not firm like most meats, but broken up pieces taste just fine too.<br /><br />Marinated tofu cubes also do well on kebabs with veggies on the grill.<br /><br />Plain tofu ""creams"" well and is often good in a dish that requires thickness.  We've made chocolate mousse with it as well as scrambling it like eggs.<br /><br />We have great success breading pressed cubes of this tofu just like you would the chicken in a General Tso recipe.  General Tso's Tofu is AWESOME.  The flavor comes from the sauce so you don't need to marinate first.<br /><br />Some people also freeze tofu--generally remove from packaging and press first--to give it a firmer consistency.<br /><br />Tofu is all about how you prepare it.  Most people will NOT like it plain, so don't expect to just dig a fork into it.<br /><br />This particluar product is great because of its all-purpose nature (firm is definitely better than soft for saute, etc) and its shelf life.  I would have given it five stars but the must-be-refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer.  They don't last as long in the house, though, so this is a perfect choice to keep in the pantry (usually dated a few to several months out)."
08	27954,B000LKZ94G,A3NN3UJXKVHQR1,10/18/08,0,0,5,GREAT for Kids!!!,"Both of my sons LOVE this pasta.  I, personally, think that Tinkyada pastas taste better (more like ""real"" pasta), but my kids like this just as much.  I think the fun, animal shapes make it more appealing to them.  They love the letter-shaped pasta (made by the same company) as well.  I wish the company hadn't made the pasta-size larger though, as my kids liked the smaller size better.  Oh well, they still like it and I'm thrilled to have found it on Amazon.  Our local MOMs store stopped carrying it, so we haven't had it in quite some time."

The preparation time is still very quick, and it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These noodles are far thicker and chewier than your standard supermarket Top Ramen noodles.  They also come with a spice package and a dry ingredients packet that contains bits of seaweed, mushrooms, and carrots.<br /><br />I usually only put in about 3/4 of the spice package and add extra ingredients like nappa cabbage, shrimp, scallops, green onions, mung bean sprouts, and/or an egg.  Kimchi also goes really well with these noodles.<br /><br />The bulk price that Amazon offers is an excellent deal, especially for people who don't have access to Asian supermarkets.  It's the perfect food to have for when you want a quick and flavorful meal."

Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that."

Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did."

He used to grab the bag out of the pantry to ask for it.  Now I have added it to his picture cards so he can flip through the cards and ask for it.  He loves the texture and the shapes and colors are fun.  The rest of the family will eat it as well.  It has a great texture when cooked al-dente and when stored in the refrigerator does not get mushy.

Only about half of the crackers in each package remain in tact.  The cost is a really good deal as long as you don't need the crackers to be in tact.

The alternative would be to have massives of packaging to protect them and surely we don't want any more excessive packaging.<br />Let's not encourage suppliers to do that. What's a broken cracker compared to a broken planet?<br />I just save the whole ones for entertaining and enjoy the broken ones as my snack! They are delicious whole or broken!

That's when I discovered Itoen bottled teas. I love Itoen products because they offer a variety of unsweetened Asian teas like Mugi cha (barley tea), Jasmine tea, and Oolong, Lemongrass, and mint teas. I like all of them but Oi Ocha is my favorite. Yes, its easier to brew tea at home but in Osaka, I was always busy and running around so I wanted something that was good that I could pick up at any vending machine or convinence store.<br />Oi Ocha goes well with quick snack foods like Onigiri (rice balls) with sour plum inside or butaman (pork filled buns with Cantonese barbaqued pork inside aka Nikuman outside of the Kansai area.)<br />I am so glad that amazon is offering a 12-pack to buy. I usually take it with me to work because I drink tea and bottled water more than anything else. I used to drink Coke but the excessive sugar puts on the weight. I never had a problem with weight gain from tea drinking.<br />If you're looking for a quality bottled green tea, then try this one. Its great as an everyday green tea without any sugar.<br />Its has no calories or added colors or flavors either.<br />It gets me going in the morning better than coffee.<br />I hate bottled teas from Lipton, Snapple, and Arizona."

That's what this stuff is - good green tea in a bottle that is ready-to-drink. It's absolutely great when cold. (The taste is nutty and mild.) Best of all, it has ZERO calories. But to be honest, I don't drink this because of the lack of calories. I drink it because it tastes GOOD. Buy some and see why it's getting very popular - even among those who aren't dieting."

I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product.  Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes.  I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.  It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible))."

I have eaten ""red apples"" before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with ""red apple"" flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this ""red apple"" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this ""red apple"" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD."

Since we discovered this tea some two years ago, it is the only tea that we use.  Bentley is known for it's high quality and this white tea is just that.  The light hint of ginger with the pleasant blending of peach makes this a very smooth delight.  While it is not caffeine free it certainly is lower in caffeine than other green or black teas therefore also making it a fine evening dinner tea.  TO YOUR HEALTH!"

The name Stomach Ease is really right on the money because it quickly eases stomach discomfort.<br /><br />The ingredients are a little intimadating for sure!  I'm not a fan of black licorice at all, and that nearly stopped me from buying this.  The taste is interestingly strong, it's not something I had ever tasted before.  The flavor of the tea is like notes in a harmony because you are noticing many different flavors that make a wonderful combined taste.  To say that it quickly grows on you wouldn't be far off from the mark.<br /><br />It's a wonderful product - that I recommend to anyone with issues with their stomach.  Give it a chance you will not be disappointed!"

They're so good I dare say that they're addictive from the very first time you try a few. The taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods.<br /><br />The main ingredient is whole grain brown rice; and yes, this is good for you. I haven't had regular potato chips in quite a while; but I would imagine that these chips have less fat then potato chips have. There are no trans fats, no cholesterol, no preservatives, no and artificial flavors. They are even wheat and gluten free! Very good! They have less than 1 gram of sugar per serving.<br /><br />They do have some sodium; they have about 200mg of sodium in every serving; and there are roughly five servings to a bag.<br /><br />If you have further questions, the company maintains a website and an email address so you can contact them. Good PR!<br /><br />Overall, these are some very awesome chips! I highly recommend them. Enjoy!"

IMHO this honey has so special flavor or texture, in fact it crystallizes even when stored unopened. But I like the fact that it supports bee populations in a healthy locale. With the plight of the declining bee as it struggles to survive we need environments such as this to ensure the bee and our agriculture systems survive. So for that reason and since it is raw and unfiltered, I will continue to buy this product. Other honeys you may want to try that are sold on AMZN are Cal's Tupelo raw honey made in GA (incredibly good and smooth), and outside of the US consider Manuka Honey from New Zealand (amazing health benefits) and my very favorite is Bernard Michaud 1000 Flower Honey from the South of France. It is very expensive but truly heavenly and worth the price as a special treat. I use this one solely on toast or pastries or by the spoonful.  At Tropical Traditions I buy their Canadian organic raw and unfiltered honey that in order to be somewhat cost effective, I buy it in a 15# pail that lasts a year. I use honey mainly during the fall and winter for constant tea sweetening (yes. I gain a few pounds) but I rationalize it's healthier than organic sugar and it supports bee farmers."

It doesn't taste stale if you can't heat it and it stays fairly good for a few days just sitting on the counter in a Ziploc.  It works just fine using my Kitchen Aid mixer and my oven, I didn't need a bread machine.<br /><br />The suggestion on the package to add 2 TBSP molasses for a whole wheat bread taste makes a good GF bread great.  Also, I've continued using a tip I picked up somewhere to substitute 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed + 1/4 cup water for 2 eggs (more fiber, less fat).  These two things turn out a good brown bread that makes a great ham & Swiss w/ stone ground mustard.<br /><br />Amazon Subscribe & Save has the best price on this product that I've seen.

Many of the flours I used were difficult to find locally and some I had to grind myself.  Often the bread was heavy tasting or donwright strange tasting, with much work and effort often just wasted.<br /><br />After trying Pamela's Wheat Free Bread Mix, it was obvious I had been wasting my time.  I have tried many variations suggested on the package, made foccacia, buns, rolls and many other uses such as pizza dough and calzones.  This works perfectly in my bread maker, (using only one knead cycle) and have also used mixing by hand.  The bread comes out perfectly everytime, with just the right amount of consistency & rise, without gigantic air holes or packed so tightly it looks like pound cake."

The selling point is the organic, fair trade aspect. Also, the elimination of the middle-man, but I'd have to review the books before I'd believe that.

08	29281,B000PDY3P0,A12Y2YEYK7VZSW,7/25/08,29,30,4,"Delicious, Quality Popcorn","I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!"

It is moist and holds together well even when sliced warm out of the bread maker. I bake it in a Breadman TR 875 and follow the directions on the bag of the bread mix (which says to NOT use the gluten free setting). I'm baking bread from Pamela's bread mix for my 11 year old granddaughter who also must eat gluten free. It allows her to take sandwiches to school like the other kids. The bread toasts well and probably freezes well, but we eat it too fast to worry about that. It bakes well with added herbs, cheese, etc. It's a good product."

They stopped carrying the chips and I had to look elsewhere for these delicious snacks. No local store carried them, so I turned to Amazon.com in hopes of finding them. As soon as I discovered them on the list of foods carried by Amazon, I ordered a box.<br />When the box of chips arrived, I opened a bag of the  Riceworks Salasa Fresca chips, only to find not a single whole chip. The largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip. It was impossible to use them to dip with. I hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product, but, most of the bags had similarly damaged chips. On average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag.<br />It was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping. Because of the condition of the chips upon arrival, I will not buy them from Amazon.com again.<br />Great Chips when they are whole. A great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces."

Now, the flavor comes from real peppermint, so it's not going to last as long as the fake stuff, nor it will be as mind-blowingly intense as some of the new super-flavored gums.  But if that's ok with you and you'd like to chew something that doesn't put weird chemicals into your body, this is for you.  It's expensive, sadly, but what can you expect?

Normally, I'm not a big fan of canned soups, but the Alphabet Soup is an exception.  It's a rich tomatoey broth with a few vegetables and pasta alphabets.  I like soup without a lot of ""clutter,"" so to speak.  My sole complaint is that the alphabet noodles are a bit mushy, but then what do you expect in a canned soup?  Still, if you're looking for something to warm you on a chilly or rainy day, Amy's Fat Free Alphabet Soup fits the bill."

Because as a food, Haribo gummie bears are somewhere between Friskie's Turkey & Giblets and gravel.  Haribo brand gummie bears lack flavor, gum, or bear.  They're even shaped like tiny fragments of Mount Rushmore -- doubly impressive for a German candy that never even witnessed South Dakota.<br /><br />If you need a solid gummie, go for Target's Market Pantry brand or whatever Area 51 concoction going on at Saratoga Sweets in Clifton Park, NY.

My first experience, however, was not positive. The first loaf collapsed - due to the fact that I mistakenly added too much liquid. Fortunately, all subsequent loaves have baked perfectly. The texture of this bread is soft and does not crumble. The taste is a bit on the sweet side, but it is still delicious. My non-GF son loves this bread (especially when it is fresh) and prefers it over his gluten wheat bread. Definitely worth a try."

And then MORE to make dinner rolls...all came out very well. I am very pleased. If you go to the Chebe website you can find many more recipes which is nice because for each recipe it tells you which versions of Chebe Bread Mix can be used for which recipes (and now there are 5 or more varieties of this Mix). I am planning on trying out the Sticky rolls and a pizza crust with this Mix so I will see how that goes. The mix, is very fine and fly away....so you want to take it easy when opening it and pouring into the bowl or you will have a fine dusting of powder around the area you are mixing it in.

I've been adding poppy seeds to add a slightly different flavor.  It still has the heaviness that all gluten free breads have, but it is lighter than most and toasts well if not cut too thickly. I cut the loaves in half and freeze one half. I use a regular mixing machine."

08	60363,B0019F30J8,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,6/5/08,27,27,5,A Must Have for the Foodies Spice Cabinet,"When I first received my order of the Italian Dressing mix, I was a little wary. A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE!<br /><br />When my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.<br /><br />Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.<br /><br />Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack.  Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set:<br /><br />*  French Garden<br />At first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version.  The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death).  The garlic and onions were strong, but not too.  I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon.  I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny).  Very nice!  My fear of it being too salty was put to rest.  I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away!  It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable.  I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure.<br /><br />*  Napa Garden<br />This mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend.  This one was not as salty as the other two.  The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta.  That turn out to be a good choice.  The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety pack.  All three will become staples in my spice cabinet."

I ordered this product thinking it would at least improve the taste a little. Well, now everyone in my family is hooked on this stuff. Even my picky husband loves it. My daughter loves to mix with olive oil and dip bread in it. All of the flavors are absolutely wonderful. You've got to give them a try."
08	60365,B0019F30J8,A285L3HTROKIUA,10/12/08,12,13,5,Delicious and Gluten Free Too!,"I have been looking for a long time for a decent salad dressing. The store-bought dressings haven't done the trick (unhealthy oils, mysteriously long-named ingredients, odd to no taste, etc), the mixes we've tried haven't been much better, and I have yet to find a really terrific homemade dressing that is similar to what I can get in my favorite Italian restaurant. So, I was a bit leery when I saw these. But the price was right and so with a ""sure can't hurt"" attitude, we bought the Italian mix.<br /><br />Oh my! It is very tasty with just the right blend of spices and ""zing"" (not a hot and spicy zing, just an ""awaken the tastebuds"" zing). We all loved it and so were inspired to try the other varieties. There is no disappointment here! All 3 are simply delicious and have me wishing that, like a cow, I had more stomachs so I could eat more of the stuff ;o)  I find myself craving salads at all sorts of times and it makes a yummy marinade also.<br /><br />Seeing how our family recently found we need to go gluten-free, I contacted the company to ask about their GF status. The reply was that though the bottles are not yet labeled as such (they soon will be) they are most certainly gluten-free. So, one more thing we restricted diet people can have to enjoy. YAY!!<br /><br />It's great to be able to make up our dressings with the healthy oils we enjoy and to be able to understand every ingredient on the label. Our family appreciates that. Along with it being economical, I'd say you can't go wrong. Try them out. And if you don't like them, well, you can give them to me ;o)<br /><br />Bon Appetit!"

I was overjoyed when, a few months after my return a found that it was available in an expensive grocery store near me.  Unfortunately, the kind of Orangina sold in the US is not the same beverage that is available in Europe.  The ingredients are totally different.  Since this product page says ""Made in the US"", I can only assume this is the American recipe, which is not as tasty (but probably has a longer shelf life).

Long story short, it's not bad stuff -- but since I don't read Greek, it's taken a lot of experimentation with amounts to get the amounts right.  I find that if I don't use enough of the instant granules, I get a thin acidic cup, so I personally use about two tablespoons per cup of hot water.<br /><br />Remember that this is intended to taste like strong Greek coffee, not drip-brew, and is best taken with sugar, no cream.

When I tried 5-Hour Energy, the first thing that I noticed was that I noticed nothing at all.  I gradually became more alert and less tired, but not once did I experience the jitters, a fast heart rate or any of the other side effects some claim to have experienced here.  What I did feel was what I feel like after having had a restful night's sleep.  I wasn't going to run a marathon at full speed, but I wasn't going to zone out for the rest of the day either.  I remained awake and alert for roughly seven hours, so the five hour claim might just be an estimate.  Either way, when it was time for bed, I had no problem going to sleep and absolutely ZERO crash effects.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of this drink is the taste.  It's somewhat medicinal, but pretty much all energy drinks have a medicinal taste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you want something to ""take it up a notch"" while working out or doing hard physical labor, 5-Hour Energy might not be for you.  However, if you want a few steady, alert hours minus the jitters, 5-Hour Energy is the perfect choice."

But, 5-hour, like all of these energy drinks (Monster, RockStar, RedBull, Cocaine etc.) is obscenely overpriced liquid caffeine. As of 2008, there have been no large scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials that show the ingredients, other than caffeine, in these ""proprietary blends"" actually work in healthy humans as advertised. When pressed, the manufacturers cannot come up with the data that support their hype. To date, only good ol' caffeine is the only over-the-counter drug that does what people who buy these overpriced snake-oils desire. So, save your money. Buy ANY drink you like and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill like max strength NoDoz or Vivarin. Cheers."

Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isn't the right product.

I haven't eaten the chemically-laden version in years...but remember the neon orange junk that got stuck on my fingers. Robert's Pirate Booty is just delicious and addictive. You have been warned!"

It's light and airy and for me like gopher nuts (you know you keep goin fer more, yuck yuck...), my bro-in-law thought, meh. So - crack for me, not so much for him. I'm the one that counts so 5 stars!"

I had heard a lot about this from my friends but hadn't tried it myself. Fortunately for me, I could lay my hands on a small packet and that was it. No other commercial snack (yep! homemade snacks by mom are the best in the world, this comes second) comes even close to the great taste of Pirate's Booty. It indeed felt like I got hold of some great booty when I tasted it. Get it, you won't be sorry."

And was the only thing that took care of All Day sickness by the third trimester.<br /><br />The only bad thing about it was the company I bought it from.  They charged $17.00 shipping for two boxes of this tea.  Next time I'll be ordering this from someone else.
08	84943,B0012UYVRK,AU44ANEEZXP3D,11/4/08,23,23,5,You have to do it right!,"This stuff is great, my kids love it!  No artificial colors, flavors, no sugar, and no harmful chemicals like the blue stuff, pink stuff, or yellow stuff.<br /><br />You have to know how to do it right though!<br /><br />First off, use about half of what they suggest.  You can always add more later if you want more, but with Stevia if you use too much it will taste bitter.  Some flavors require more than 1/2 strength.  With orange for example I use their recommended amounts, but the other flavors are anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended amounts.  Always start with less and add more until it tasts right for you.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a long time for it to dissolve.  Mix it in and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before trying any, and really it is best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  If you just dump some in the top and take a drink you will be VERY disappointed as it will clump and just sit there.<br /><br />We use a dispensing refrigerator container so the kids can serve themselves.  I make 5L at a time, one of each flavor and it is always a hit."

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."

Another friend of mine started cooking it in her bread machine and says that it works great that way. (follow the bread machine directions)"

He loves this bread and pretty much won't eat others!  It's easy to make and bake (by hand - I do not have a bread machine). I use Soy milk.  It bakes perfect every time :)  Just follow the directions. Slice when it's cool and freeze. It makes great sandwich bread and toast.  The Sweet Bread recipe on the package is good, too.  I haven't yet tried the other recipes but am sure of their success and great taste and texture as well.  What's even better is Amazon's great price on the case of six!  You simply can't beat it."

Surprisingly, this is neither a 'burn your mouth hot' rub, nor is it even heavy on the cumin and curry flavors.  (Though why *wouldn't* you be surprised, given the exceedingly generic Product Description that Amazon lists for this mix!)<br /><br />There really isn't a single dominant note in this rub, it's a balance of cardamom, smoked paprika, garlic, and even (I suspect) cinnamon. I'd advise people who want to kick things up a notch to add a dash of cayenne or black pepper.<br /><br />This works very well on lamb, chicken, and (surprisingly!) fish such as catfish or snapper.  Tends to be lackluster on red meats and fish like tuna and salmon.<br /><br />Only the two standout mixes that Chef Tom sells: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are better than this one, mostly due to their extra versatility."

You will not get tired of the flavor since you get to sample a number of them :<br /><br />3 wintermints<br />3 peppermints<br />3 cinnamints<br />3 spearmints<br />3 bubblemints<br /><br />Like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war and it was really intended for our soldiers.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of ""Juicy Fruit"". It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States."

But all of them made me jittery and made me feel uneasy, even before an intense workout. I go to the gym at 5:30AM everyday and take one of these on the way out the door. As soon as I get halfway to the gym, I cannot wait to hit the weights! Now sometimes I will add a sugar free Red Bull on leg day, but one of these usually does the trick on regular days. I love this stuff. I hate the feeling most pills and drinks give me. This stuff just makes me feel alert."

The price fluctuates wildly with these kinds of bones, so watch for a sale. I paid about 3 bucks."

However, it still has its drawbacks.<br /><br />First, the PROs -<br /><br />Instant energy - Works almost immediately (within 1 minute for me)<br /><br />Not a lot of ""jitter"" - Many other energy bars and drinks give you that shaky feeling.  This one does not<br /><br />No Crash - Its true, there is no crash.  Though when you come back to your previous energy level, it might feel like a crash.<br /><br />A very positive energy - In addition to the physical energy you also get a very refreshing mental energy.  It can almost be described as a very focused high.  A feeling of clarity and motivation all at once<br /><br />Small amount goes a long way - I like that you dont have to drink a big 16 oz bottle of this stuff.  Most energy drinks have a taste about as appealing as bath water.  So, its nice to only have to drink an oz or two<br /><br />Now, for the CONS<br /><br />Taste - See above<br /><br />Thirst - I get very thirsty on this stuff.  I always have to make sure to have a big bottle of water around<br /><br />Its addictive - The ""mental"" energy you get from this makes you want to do it all over again.  Probably not for people with addictive personalities<br /><br />Big initial blast - The first 10 minutes for me are almost too much.  I seem to want to do everything all at once.  After that, i calm down a bit and become intensely focused.  But, those first 10 minutes are usually spent just trying not to knock anything over in my office"

To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body."

First, the portions really are tiny -- two ounces makes a thin piece about two inches by two inches square, and that includes skin. It's enough for a small appetizer for one, but no more. I would not give someone such a skimpy amount as a gift.<br /><br />Second, the salmon itself is on the dry side. While I don't like my smoked salmon to be *too* oily, this goes to the opposite extreme. The result is not as flavorful and satisfying as I would prefer.<br /><br />I will definitely eat the remaining packs, but would not buy this product again."

The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I won't waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.

The Bouquet arrived exactly at its destination when I was told it would, and was apparently beautifully and impecibly packaged with a lovely message card, also inside were all the care instruction for the flowers and flower food etc. My friend has told me ""You could not have walked and picked these flowers from a field any fresher"" that they are an enormous arrangement with so many flowers and colours it was hard for her to describe, and best of all is they are sented, and very beautifully sented. My friends were just so overwhelmed by the package and are frightened I've spent to much, I've told her to look on line because I am so thrilled with the service. And certainly my friends in the States are going to be using this service and Falcon Farms for sending flowers to there loved ones now.<br />To get this kind of Bouquet delivered here within the UK would have cost about  80(at the very least) and I kid not.

Having drunk merely half the bottle, I felt energized and ready to roll in three or four minutes. The product was true to its label in that I was able to study with concentration from 12 o'clock to 5 with no ""afternoon slump"" or ""jitters""(though for a time I did experience a subtle tingling in my fingers). When my five hours were up, I came back to normal and didn't feel any side effects or ""caffeine crash"". The product is not addictive: I bought a pack of twelve bottles a month ago and still haven't used them all.<br /><br />5-hour energy should be used with wisdom, however -- the manufacturers say that it contains ""no more caffeine than a cup of coffee"" but doesn't specify the size of the cup. It took me an hour longer than normal to get to sleep when I drank a whole bottle.<br /><br />That said, I have no other complaints to offer of this excellent energy drink. I suggest taking half of a bottle whenever you need a boost of concentration or motivation, as that is usually sufficient. Also, drink these only when you need to -- it's potent stuff, and I wager those little bottles can disappear quickly.<br /><br />5-hour energy is a great resource for workouts, daily business, and the hurly-burly of modern life. I give it 4 stars."

I wouldn't have gone near this with a ten foot pole had I not been behind a woman in scrubs purchasing some in a convenience store. I asked her if it worked, she was very favorable and her doctor/boss was positive about it as well. I went home, did more research, saw that the results ran the gamut, but I saw no one experiencing any severe side effects. I took the plunge.<br /><br />I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) that is under control with medication, but I'd been recently finding myself extremely tired from early afternoon to the end of my work day (and beyond). I started out with half a bottle of 5-hour after lunch and am extremely happy with the result. It's not dramatic - it just gets me from ""tired"" to ""not tired"" for the afternoon and early evening. I've experienced none of the side effects that others have, but two things that I'm doing are (1) not drinking on an empty stomach, and (2) only using 1/2 bottle.<br /><br />I'm by no means downplaying anyone else's experiences - we're all different, our bodies react differently to all sorts of things, but I would definitely recommend to anyone to give it a shot.

When I'm crashing, caffeine just gives me the jitters and I still feel tired, no matter how much coffee or tea I drink.  I had a bad mid-afternoon crash and could hardly keep my eyes open so I drank a bottle of this stuff.  Instantly, I had mid-morning perkiness again.  Magic.  No after effects, but if you're dead tired to begin with you should probably treat the cause rather drinking energy drinks which relieve only the symptoms.

Thought that it would be interesting to try since it was powdered and didn't require any brewing. Simply pour into a glass and add water. Could it really be that good if so simple?<br /><br />A resounding YES. I was very surprised. I've been drinking green tea for awhile, so I can see where some may not like the taste at first. But as you continue it grows on you quickly. I tend to like my tea on the stronger side, so the next glass may use 2 packets instead of 1 and slightly more water.

08	56476,B0000VYKZA,A1OQ5YU9CA5WZO,3/28/08,1,1,4,Very interesting blend,"I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.<br /><br />Out of the bag, the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule . Even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket, the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air, the aroma starts to leak. Grind your beans moments before you put it to use, you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it."

Hard to believe I know, considering they seem to be on every street corner, but believe it or not there are still large sections of the US w/out Starbucks. So for those of us who want good coffee, Thank God for the internet & amazon. Verona is my favorite SB blend. It doesn't taste burnt as some of their coffee does to me. It has a boldness without being too dark & overwhelming, and it has subtle notes of chocolate without the icky sweetness of a flavored coffee. It makes a delicious cup of coffee."

But it's always short lived so he always brought a few to work. This one seems to be working for him. Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.

For those that do not know understand, ADD and ADHD people have an issue if various stimulants and relaxants having the opposite effect. For an example, Red-Bull will put me to sleep while a Benadryl will have me bouncing of the walls.<br /><br />5-Hour will not have me bouncing off the walls or falling asleep.

Really sleepy and lethargic, no focus.  This stuff usually does the trick.  One minute you're falling out of your chair, the next, you're good to go.  Alert and focused.  It's been a lifesaver more than once.  I'm also going to school online, and it has saved my bacon there, as well. I get the 12 pack and keep some at home and some in my drawer at work.  For me, its effect is usually about 3 hours, though.<br /><br />I seem to need the whole bottle, and I guess I'm one of the few that really prefers the Lemon-Lime flavor to the others.  The taste's not great; but it beats Red Bull and the like in taste, and effectiveness - and, you only have to drink the small bottle instead of a whole can.  Only 4 calories.  Sugarfree.  Not much caffeine.  I can honestly say the only time I've experienced anything close to jitters, is when I drank two in one day.  Even then, it wasn't the usual ""too much caffeine"" jitters.  It's the best thing I've ever found.  Tried another brand last month- tasted even worse and didn't work as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend 5 Hour!"

08	60760,B003QNJYXM,A1NZR5TI1FGHQA,12/2/08,12,17,1,As ineffective for me as sugar-free Red Bull...,"First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked:  different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product.<br /><br />And some background:  In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull.  Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either."

Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could."

It is moist, slices good and keeps well.  It also freezes well.  It is not too bad for being expensive if you order it from Amazon.  it's an even better deal if you put it on automatic order.

From what I've read so far, I believe this particular version is not aged like the very high-end, expensive, caked versions are, but it seemed like a good way to get a taste of this tea variety.  I am not disappointed at all.  Though it's not a drastic departure from other teas, it's not quite like any I've had before.  It's very mild and earthy, with a subtle sweetness -- VERY pleasant!<br /><br />Something else that sets it apart from other (non-herbal) teas: It doesn't get bitter after extended steeping!  Furthermore, as I've read elsewhere, just one serving goes a long way.  In fact, I never stop steeping it.  When my cup is almost empty, I just top it off again.  I get at least four flavorful cups with just one of the prewrapped nuggets.<br /><br />This instantly became one of my favorite teas.  I'm delighted I finally discovered it, and just may have to spend the $ to try one of the more expensive/exotic versions.  If it's even better than this, I would understand why folks are willing to pay such a premium $."

Try adding herbs and spices to the mix (rosemary and a little extra olive oil is really good, or Italian herbs) or any flavor you like, it's a great base. It also makes great pizza dough, though it's a bit hard to work with in terms of texture. I definitely recommend this mix, it's tasty, has a great texture, and pretty easy to make, all in all."

On the other hand, if you have found Whole Foods gluten-free loaves, such as the Prairie bread with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then I think you'll be disappointed as I was. I tried the manual mixing method, and took special care to allow the bread to rise as I would a non-GF bread. The instructions say only to let it rise 1 hr. which I believe is inadequate. Perhaps the yeast in the supplied packet was not as active as it should have been -- in any event the resulting bread did not rise properly in several attempts. Flavor is not that great, but I did make some ""everything"" bagels which were fairly tasty if not very light."

08	6496,B000FNEX50,A3C1I1T8I5IPW0,2/16/08,0,0,5,My son loves these cookie bars!,"My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!"
08	6497,B000FNEX50,APCDN1JK6B81P,1/6/08,0,0,4,Cookies you don't have to feel guilty about eating!,"I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great ""hearty"" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies."

I have not used this item, am just giving definition.","Non-GE - ""GE"" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be ""instant gratification"" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products"

It is so distressing not to be able to soothe you child when they are obviously hurting.  My last attempt was to add tea to her formula.  I steeped the tea as instructed and added 1/2 ounce of Ginger Aid to every 6 ounces of formula (discolored formula a little).  The results were amazing!  She has gone from screaming for hours and having a look for misery on her face at most times to one of peace!  She eats better, sleeps better and is more alert during her awake hours.  The look she had on her face of discomfort all the time is now replaced with a look of relaxation. The screaming is now just bedtime fussiness.

Of all places - this was served to me at my favorite Mexican restaurant!<br /><br />Hubby and I eat there weekly and usually the owners like to treat us to an after-meal cappuccino - but the brother who makes them wasn't there one night, so another of the family offered to make us some ""special"" tea - and indeed special it IS, as he had brought a personal stash of it back from Spain.  He served it to us with half & half - what a lovely, robust drink!<br /><br />I immediately got on my favorite on-line merchant's site and found that indeed, PG Tips could be had through Amazon - so wasted no time in ordered.<br /><br />I drink this almost to the exlusion of all my others now and will most definitely reorder when I run low."

It can be used to deodorize the refrigerator, closets, car interiors, garbage cans, and food coolers.  It can be used to help clean the laundry.  It can extinguish  small grease and electrical fires in the kitchen.<br /><br />The use of baking soda for antacids is effective, but it should be used only rarely.  Any persistent indigestion requires medical attention.  What is ""indigestion"" could be a cardiac emergency.  Also baking soda has a high sodium content.<br /><br />It can be used to whiten teeth.  Some people use it for deodorant. A small amount in warm water makes an excellent gargle for a sore throat.<br /><br />It can be used to deodorize carpet and upholstery, but it is important to check for colorfastness in a small spot first.<br /><br />We use it for cooking.  My mother used it in her peanut brittle.  I remember how it used to foam when she added the baking soda, and her recipe is in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook  My friend Cathy uses baking soda in her delicious crawfish cornbread, and her recipe  is in  The Collard Patch  When we cook collard greens, we often add a tiny little pinch to the collards - only 1/8 teaspoon to tenderize the collard greens.  Several of the recipes in THE COLLARD PATCH include that little pinch of baking soda."

These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list ""high fructose corn syrup"" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it."

I take mine with milk & sugar; as I learned from my time in England.  A perfect treat on a cold night while you read and relax.

It was half dead when I got it, and the company said I could pay to return it to them, and would have to have it packaged in a certain way.  Cost more to ship back.  I kept it and I am still not happy.  I bought a few plant from them.  I have a green thumb and love house plants, but these were not worth it."
08	9505,B000UBDKII,AC1637YP1NQOG,5/1/08,0,1,5,great coffee!,I love this coffee and it is so convenient to have it shipped to me automatically!

It's a good coffee.<br /><br />But this is called French Vanilla Caramel, and this review is based on the product's name.<br /><br />Let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors... coffee, ice cream, candy, you name it... if it's vanilla or caramel, I love it.<br /><br />With the exception of this.<br /><br />Where's the vanilla? Where's the caramel? And don't get me wrong: I'm not trying to say that the flavors are too mild. I'm saying that they are NON-EXISTENT. And therefore, based on the name, this coffee gets 1 star."

08	87687,B000EVT042,A6T1RHMQ9NSE4,2/26/08,14,15,5,Haribo Gummi Bears BURSTING with FLAVOR!,"First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true. If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy! You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh and delicious. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some.  But, I do recommend the five pound bag over the pack of twelve.  You get approximately a pound and a half more in the five pound bag for about .50 more!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more and different kinds. We all have our favorites!"
08	87691,B000EVT042,A17BUUBOU0598B,6/29/08,4,4,5,Haribo Original Gold-Bears - Great Candy Snack with Less Guilt!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT042"">Haribo's Original Gold-Bears (Pack of 12)</a> is a great way to buy sweets that aren't always easy to find in the US. I wasn't always a Haribo gummi fan, but I have my ex girlfriend to thank for getting me hooked.  These come in sugar free versions as well, but I prefer the regular ones.<br /><br />I really love this 12 pack more than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVOSE4"">Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound Bags</a> that are also sold on Amazon.  The main reason is that the 5 lb bag is only ideal for a party with A LOT of kids eating them.  I know that the 5 lb bag gives you more candy for your money.  But these 5 OZ bags keep the gummis fresh and help with portion control.<br /><br />I always share when I eat these or save the excess.  For me a 5-oz bag is too much to eat alone.  1 5-Oz bag is good enough for 3 or 4 people to share.<br /><br />Haribo gummis are very chewy compared to others, but they also contain less sugar and more fruity flavor.  I personally think they are the best.  They have 5 flavors inside including pineapple, lemon, orange raspberry and strawberry.<br /><br />Definitely don't hesitate to get this.  I haven't tried all of the weird flavors (cola, etc) but I have had many and they are almost all great.  But these original bears are going to please most people.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
08	60807,B001E5E05G,APMN4KPQSMKTX,11/2/08,5,7,5,Great product but overpriced at Amazon,"Great product but with the ubiquitous 25% off coupons at Fresh & Easy on $20 purchases, comes out out to $2.55 per box everyday.  At closer to $4 a pop from Amazon why buy unless you're a masochist or there's no F&E near you?  Here's hoping Amazon gets real & lowers the price to F&E levels."
08	76926,B0001AU3OW,AEH8SJHQ5RQ3U,4/27/08,0,0,4,tea,I love that there is no pouring required for this product. There is no mess will spillage or with loose tea leaves. Its great for a quick cup of tea or for a group. I also enjoyed the sampler because i could try out the different types. Cleaning the tea leaves out required filling the pot with water and swishing it around instead of having a tea filter to dump the leaves in one swoop. That is the only set back to this great product.
08	60810,B001E5E05G,A1CQINLMHJ1ZXL,5/3/08,2,3,5,Wallyworld LoL,"This is a staple in my diet, high fiber and protein content (imo it's the best of the GoLean series health wise)  and tastes great! Probably not everyones cup of tea, but would you really eat this if you weren't trying to eat healthier?<br /><br />The people in the previous reviews are correct that the price isn't THAT competitive. Though with the subscription (free shipping, Prime not needed) it is pretty good, especially considering most of Kashi cereal is close to $5.<br /><br />For the people who buy this at walmart and target, how often to do go to those god awful places??? I mean seriously if you drove to walmart just for  cereal that's damn expensive box(es) of cereal right there. If you go to walmart every week knock yourself out on their more aggressively priced kashi and think yourself smart as you overpay for some of their other items.<br /><br />Sure you could buy 10 boxes and save some money, but if you're like me you wouldn't want to waste time, gas and deal with such places like walmart."
08	76924,B0001AU3OW,A126F7OK2T4JUX,6/20/08,1,1,5,Wonderful Product!,"This was on my daughter's wish last fall for her birthday, so I bought it for her.  Her husband & I loved it so much that I got it for him for Christmas, and my own husband surprised me with it.  We all love it and still use it daily.  The teas from Adagio are wonderful, but it's the pot that is truly extraordinary.  I highly recommend this for any tea drinker and it makes a really excellent gift."
08	76923,B0001AU3OW,A1FIYCNU0KRDQA,9/23/08,2,2,5,I wish I could give more then 5 stars,"This is the best idea ever. I have many pots for loose tea and make tea every day. I have used ""bags"" to put loose tea in and balls to hold loose tea or a pot with a filter in the middle, I've used a small filter that sits on top of my cup but nothing works near as well, and is as convenient as this pot. You put the loose tea and boiling water in the pot and after it has steeped you place the pot on top of your cup, the tea drips into the cup because the rim of the cup presses it's valve.It is the simplest way to make loose tea that I know of. A uniquie gift idea. I plan on getting one for all my tea drinking friends. Christmas shopping is going to be easy this year."

I have used those for years as both an alleviate and an ironic potpourri for would-be long-term guests, and I have never been disappointed. Imagine my dismay, then, when I received (by breathless messenger) this item, clearly intended to be *eaten*.  Shudder."

08	83849,B0000SY9UE,A1LYG8VBXVW7PR,2/23/08,3,4,5,Not gross like most coffees,"I'm more of a tea drinker but occasionally want something different and I like this to keep me up or wake me up too. So, keep in mind I haven't tasted lots of coffees. I find most coffees bitter and gross, like starbucks or whatever my mom buys. With some splenda I actually enjoy this, so even if you don't like coffee give this a try. It's definitely one of the better one."
08	60832,B001E5E05G,A3RAZ16FFW39ME,2/5/08,1,2,5,Surprising,"I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting the typical flavorless ""nuts and twigs"", but like the taste of this."

08	87692,B000EVT042,AU7SCW3DM95Q0,7/12/08,3,3,5,Just deliciously delicious!,"I have been hooked on these gummi bears for years! I used to work on an Army base and whenever one of our soldiers would go TDY to Germany, we would make him bring these back for us!! I'd tried different types after I left the base, but couldn't find the particular flavor. When I did happen upon it, I was so happy to discover Haribo brand again! Yay, go Gummi Bearen!!"

When they arrive, I put them into the freezer and take one out whenever I want to take one for lunch at work. It is defrosted by then and ready to eat. I really like the fact that it is not too sweet."
08	47505,B001E50TJC,A2N75ADJSRW0AH,7/31/08,4,5,3,I'm not that excited about it.,"I purchased a 12-oz bag (whole bean) of the french roast based on the several glowing reviews posted here.  After finishing off the bag, I have to say I'm not too impressed.  It's okay, in that I would definitely choose this over any Folgers coffees that I've ever had, but the roast was SO dark that it tasted burnt (I mean completely charred), which masked most of the flavors that might have been there.<br /><br />It's possible that I just got a bad batch -- that happens from time to time.  But honestly, I'm not willing to buy another bag to find out. I've recently started buying from the Roasterie and Atomic Cafe -- with coffee so good, that there's no going back for me. :-)"

They list a one cup serving as having 13 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber.  Six grams of sugar give it a slightly sweet taste.  It has 480 mg of potassium and only 85 mg of sodium, along with 20 percent of the RDA of phosphorus.  It has only limited vitamins, but I take a one-a-day supplement separately.  It is listed as having 140 calories per one cup serving, mainly from protein.  It will get somewhat soggy if you leave it setting in milk too long, but that is a feature of many dry cereals.  It can be eaten as a dry snack, something that is not always true of dry cereals.  Adding fresh fruit is optional.<br /><br />One reviewer commented on the price.  It does pay to shop around, but that is true with any product."

(If not, what group does it belong in?)  Anyway, after searching and sampling bear after bear across the globe, the Haribo are the best ever.  The flavor and more importantly the consistency of the gummi is perfect.  They are not too soft, so some of the cheap store brands and they are not too hard or solid to where you can't chew them easily.  I ate these overseas years ago and every time I traveled to Europe, I would bring home a stash.  I found that Amazon now carries them, so I am in heaven.  When I bring bags to work to share, they disappear faster than any other candy.  Really a treat.  People laugh when I tell them Haribo is the best gummi bear ever, but once they try them, they all agree with me."
08	60875,B001E5E05G,A2V8MUEA0T931U,3/31/08,0,1,5,Best breakfast food!,This is an excellent start to the day. It is slightly sweet and has excellent protein and fiber content. Go Lean keeps you full longer than other less substantial cereals and gives you a good serving of whole grains.

Then I add cinammon to taste (at least 1-2 tsps) stir some more and then pour it in a pan and toast it at 350 for 10 minutes - the resulting cereal is absolutely fabulous and I like to mix it with my sugar free activia as well as milk.<br /><br />It's super! and for weight loss use it as a meal replacement and you'll drop weight like a stone.<br /><br />However, do not order this cereal from Amazon, as I post this they want over $4 per box.

You can go out and plunk down bundles of bucks for your 'high-fallutin' name-brand coffee, but you'll only be spittin' in the wind. The French roast is robust, smooth, and aromatic, with no trace of bitterness. The original [red bag] is excellent, as well. We usually buy the whole beans and grind them at home. If you're not already using the Melita funnel drip system, give it a try. After all, your coffee will only be as good as the water you start with! Have you ever experienced a decidedly sour cup of coffee? If you have, look no further than the coffee-maker's water delivery system. In between batches, the stagnant water in the tubing becomes a bit funky. I once tore-down a typical brewing machine, the greenish slime that I found in the water lines was the stuff of sci-fi thrillers! Incidentally, for all of you coffee connoisseur snobs out there, if this brand of coffee was good enough for my parents' ol' percolator, than it's certainly plenty good enough for me."

After bouncing around from various retailer chain-branded coffees (which were inconsistent in my opinion), and occasionally trying the stronger roasts of more maintstream coffee brands, we decided to try Eight O'Clock. I think I heard it was highly regarded by Consumer Reports. Aside from the convenience and value of buying in bulk here, we are loving the taste - smooth, rich and no bitterness. Great product."

I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"

08	81969,B00097C4GW,A1P3WH08J6VEXF,10/1/08,1,7,2,More than it's worth,"I first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning Hapkido. It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4  bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits. In spring and summer I have it at room temperature. If it is cold outside I drink it warm. Either way is great. Try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water."
08	81967,B00097C4GW,A1MV7H2G87CM2R,2/11/08,1,2,3,OK but not the best,"First, this product is overpriced on Amazon... you can easily get this much cheaper at an oriental grocery store in most areas.<br /><br />Second, I found this tea to be good but it was just ok. I prefer buying roasted barley seeds from an oriental grocery store and making the tea that way. I wanted to try the tea bags for their convenience as the aforementioned method is not as convenient. However, the taste difference between making it the real way and using convenient tea bags is notable enough that I would not use this particular brand of tea bags (note: other vendors sell the tea bags will the barley seeds but too expensive).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />1. For convenience, it is a great product. However, for great barley tea, try doing it the real way with roasted barley seeds... the seeds are cheap (more characteristic of the Korean way)!<br />2. Buy from an oriental store if one is available in your area to save money - not Amazon!<br />3. Anyway you cut it, barley tea is a great tea!"

I bought a bread machine and purchase Namaste Gluten free bread mix with fear and loathing.  We were so relieved and happy when we tried the finished product.  It is moist and quite tasty!<br /><br />One thing you should know - each loaf requires 1 whole egg and 3 egg whites!  We ended up with a lot of left-over yolks! (the dogs were happy).  I purchased some White's Only and all is well.<br /><br />The Mix works wonderfully in a bread machine.

HUGE bag can get a bit stale, but this only happens with the last few handfuls and even the stale ones are better than most other gummies.<br /><br />finally, they have what i call a long betrayal period, meaning you can eat a large quantity of them before feeling sick of them.  this could be seen as a vice for their obvious dental and dietary drawbacks, but i'm giving points for their lasting quality.<br /><br />I like getting the 5 lb. bag over this box of 12 bags because it's cheaper by volume and i like the lack of excess plastic packaging involved.  plus as i stated before they don't go stale very quickly.<br /><br />very VERY good."

Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea ""add to bottled water"" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this ""top shelf"" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!"

I bought a bunch of hickory farms stuff for my other family this was the only thing that everyone thanked me on. It's good for one or two people.

I mix this with ice water and splenda.  It is a refreshing summer beverage.  I like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages.  It is convenient and easy to use.

It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck"

This product has all the right amino acids and the potassium chloride and potassium iodide that she needs right now.  She loves it - it is a life saver....I have made a decision to give her the recommended daily amount from here on out and not stop when she gets better as I feel this is how we once again got into a crisis stage of her illness.

I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.

08	26186,B0058AMY74,A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,6/2/08,1,1,5,Caution: Kettle Chips are addictive!,These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.

They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.<br /><br />They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table."
08	26183,B0058AMY74,AX668BUQRHI7C,7/20/08,1,1,4,Delicious!,"These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!"

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

These are considered healthy snacks in Germany because they are made with real fruit juice. Even the Haribo brand gummies purchased in the U.S. are not made with fruit juice. So, while I'm disappointed that I can't get what my niece has the privilege of eating in Germany, this is the best gummi in the U.S."

Something nobody in their right mind would eat and call ""fruit"".<br /><br />This is not fruit -- it's candy.  And as candy -- it's not even good candy.  Why not go for a piece of real fruit followed by a bit of REAL 60-75% chocolate made with REAL sugar.  Chocolate has the highest concentration of anti-oxidents on the planet -- so many that it has a naturally ultra-long shelf life with no zero- none- nada- not-a-bit of preservative or partially hydrogenated anything.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I've just about reached the end of my patience with these monolithic companies that market empty calories laced with poison under innocent sounding names and cute, brightly colored boxes with cartoon animals on them.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by anything that says ""Zero Grams of Trans Fat"" --if it has partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients list -- then they're splitting hairs with the labeling laws.  Partially hydrogenated oil IS Trans Fat.<br /><br />If they make the portion size small enough that 1 portion has less than .5 grams of partially hydrogenated fat (even if the portion size is only 4 grams of the food)  -- then they are within the law to lie to you and advertise their product as having 0-grams of trans fat!  Can you believe it?  Whatever happened to the spirit of the law?<br /><br />Money happened.<br /><br />If a portion size is 4-grams, and each 4-grams of a 180-gram box contains .4-grams of partially hydrogenated fat -- that means the box could contain as much as 18-grams of TRANS FAT.  It's a con.  It's a lie.  It's trying to pass a lie that falls within the letter of the law off as the truth.  I've actually read boxes where the serving size was 2 crackers -- little tiny crackers -- that together weighed less than 9 grams.  That's less than 1/3 of an ounce.  Who is that supposed to be a serving for?  Barbie?<br /><br />And if you buy these things and feed them to your children -- then you're buying the lie because it's easy, pretty, well marketed, sweet (no kidding) and without a shadow of thought or conscience."

It was on top of newspaper with styrofoam  filled to the top. It was even tightly wrapped with bubble wrap. Keep in mind that they really mean it when they say each tree is different. The tree i got was smaller than i expected it to be. But i dont know much about bonsais. And it came in a cream pot with moss. Which i love. SO when ordering a bonsai try not to get your hopes up because like i said each is different. THe one in the picture is just for to show you the type. For a four year old the price is pretty resonible. Most go in the thousands.

We have drunk Irish breakfast tea for many years, and this is an excellent blend, especially for a bag (which makes it easier).  Other brands we've tried in stores are weak imitations of the type because they tend to cut the blend with cheaper black tea in order to make a higher profit.  ToH doesn't do that and the rich flavor speaks for itself.  This tea is a definite flavorful replacement for coffee... just add cream or evaporated milk... mmmmmm...<br /><br />Do the math on this 6 box x 50 bag count and compare with what you see in stores.

I most often brew this tea in my Sunbeam Tea Drop machine using distilled water and it is suberb.  The aromaa is full and the taste is brilliant.<br /><br />I first came across this tea in a Singapore hotel room brewed in tea bags using tap water.  It is also very good in this form.  From my experience I think it would be difficult to get a bad cup!"
08	40839,B00112GBO0,A32R1JBRI56ZJA,3/20/08,12,13,5,Great black tea!,"This tea comes in vacuumed sealed foil pouches inside 6 cardboard boxes. On cutting open the sealed pouch, you are treated to the fresh scent of pure black tea. I like that there are six small pouches rather than one big one, so that I know the tea won't go stale before I can use it all.<br /><br />The leaves are definitely the highly prized top buds, and is ""single-source"" as the package info states (not blended with cheaper teas from other countries). You cannot over-brew this tea. It doesn't become bitter or acidic if you accidentally leave it brewing too long.<br /><br />So far, I've only had it hot but can tell it will also make a great iced tea."
08	33990,B00412W76S,A16V6Y0BWZAGNI,6/16/08,3,3,5,Great quality. Heathful product.,"A refreshing cold beverage and a soothing, perfect, hot cup of tea. Offers healthful benefits."
08	87721,B000EVT042,A2K7BUT8XPPR7A,7/16/08,1,1,5,Excellent,"These came fresh and flavorful. I was worried that they might be stale, because they're from Amazon, but they were still soft. These are definitely my new favorite gummi-bears."
08	13073,B000JUK4OS,AAQF1FIR68QBY,5/23/08,1,2,5,Enjoyed by Soldiers in Afghanistan,I sent a box to my son who is stationed in Kabul Afghanistan.  He was thrilled to get it and really enjoyed it. He shared some with his fellow soldiers and now they want more!!
08	53828,B000H25WMW,A1JFKJQ057QRBU,12/20/08,3,3,5,Bear Creek Cheddar Broccoli Soup,"This is a great instant soup.  It does not have the burned, overcooked taste that you get with Campbell's Broccoli soup.  It is thick and creamy and one pouch goes a long way."
08	34002,B00412W76S,A3B3F8S3RWQ4XI,5/20/08,4,5,4,Shipping Charges,"The product was fine, but the cost of shipping was more than the cost<br />of the tea.  Won't make that mistake again."
08	87722,B000EVT042,A2C0B3V5B7FXVY,6/12/08,1,1,5,Great Buy!!,It is a great buy compare to the local retail stores. I just wish Haribo had more orange colors!!
08	56506,B0017ZVDJO,AOL3TQB5VGOC9,5/13/08,5,5,5,now i can buy cd's and gelato at the same store.  SCORE.,"seriously.  this is amazing.  who knew you could order frozen food products on amazon?  if you haven't tried it yet, you have got to get on the gelato classico train . . . it is sooooo good.  i haven't tried a flavor i don't like yet and it's healthier than ice cream so, wheee!  delicious and i'd definitely recommend it (obviously) to anyone.  if you're an ice cream eater, try this and you'll never go back.  i don't even look at ice cream the same way anymore . . . try the dark chocolate with fresh strawberries: instant legend status."
08	87723,B000EVT042,AD8C5XNVSQCCT,6/9/08,1,1,5,The Best,"I consider myself a gummi bear expert. These are very flavorable with a great ""chew""."
08	53831,B000H25WMW,ABHDWJA5PX2VC,10/20/08,2,2,5,Warms your soul......,This is so great on a chilly or winter cold day. Warms you up and is so easy to make. I also sometimes will add some bits of left over ham too. The package has suggestions of what else you could add to the soup. Also is just great by itself. Great price on Amazon too. Bear Creek is a name you can count on for excellence. Love all their soups. Just so nice when you don't have the time to make you own.
08	53832,B000H25WMW,A2WOC8UBBAMH0B,5/21/08,2,2,4,Very tasty,"Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.<br /><br />The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.<br /><br />Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future."
08	87724,B000EVT042,A1DJB26VVNTKKA,6/3/08,1,1,5,Tasty gummies,These taste as good as any gummy.<br />I will try other flavors next time.
08	76741,B0049ULB78,A3E43CGZ847R52,1/31/08,2,2,5,Close second to Midnight Magic,"I have been disappointed by most of the Green Mountain k-cups I've tried but this one is very good.  It's strong and flavorful, holds up to half & half and also makes a great iced coffee.  Not as good as Timothy's Midnight Magic but a very close second.  I would order it again."
08	87725,B000EVT042,AH2RI8XI4V26Y,2/20/08,1,1,5,Yum!,This is my husband's favorite brand.  The 5 lb bag was a better value but I opted for the individual bags because we would surely eat too many in one sitting without the built-in portion control!
08	87726,B000EVT042,A21YEB2EPF2YTL,2/3/08,1,1,5,YUMMY,These are very good. They arrived fast and are being consumed as we speak. I would recommend these to everyone!!
08	10725,B000NMG99Q,A1KDYW37P6WCC8,2/14/08,1,1,5,Glad I found these again.,"I had not seen these candies in my neighborhood for a long time.  I developed a cough and nothing was working.  I tried to find these because I just had a feeling they would work.  I could not find them anywhere, so I searched Amazon, and viola, here they are.  They are a great candy and the drop of honey inside really soothes the throat.  My whole family loves them and everyone I offer them to try like them a lot.  I think Amazon will get a lot of new orders for these."
08	87727,B000EVT042,A296LUY2HMM4P1,1/7/08,1,1,5,Haribo Gummi Candy,The thing I liked about this is they came in small packages and it was delivered very quickly and fresh
08	87728,B000EVT042,A3L5M0JJG3522C,1/6/08,1,1,5,It's not your average bear,"The creme de la creme of gummi bears.  You can't find this product in any grocery stores. (*update: I found these at Long's but for a 5 oz bag they were taxing it at 1.40 a bag.) That alone says enough for me.  It's one of those things that you can only find in exclusive places ie CostPlus, Amazon, etc.<br /><br />Their product is created more of starch, not of gelatin like other brands.  This results more of a cleaner bite rather than a chewy one.  I also found that in other brands, the gummi bears tend to be oily where as Haribo coat theirs with beeswax.  The process of Haribos gummi bears take days to complete; the quality is detected once you bite it.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, fresh (especially when you have 12/5oz bags to enjoy)."
08	2628,B0016FY6H6,A3TG3FPAFO0SWT,7/3/08,2,2,5,Good for on the go,I like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea.  I've added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks.  I have fun mixing it with things.  It blends well for me.
08	55487,B0002M7WG6,A1KR4F2O0GSZ92,12/17/08,3,4,5,my girls love it!,"My dobermans love Yuppy Puppy. The enclosed pamphlet says it can take up to two weeks for your dog to learn how to work it, but that is probably an exaggeration as food is a great motivator. One of my dogs learned how to use it in under five minutes, using her paw, the other took about a day and prefers to use her snout to depress the lever. I tried to teach her with her paw but she learned her own way to do it. It is cute to watch them and is much anticipated when I say ""Work the Machine!"" Product is built sturdy for heavy use by mongrels and stays in place well. Doesn't tip over. Highly recommended."
08	4990,B000H25QVO,A16T9YLAVU899P,12/20/08,0,0,5,The best green tea,"Dynasty brand green tea is the best green tea I've ever tasted.  It never tastes stale, unlike brands I've bought in grocery stores.  This is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining.  The metal apparently keeps out moisture."
08	47601,B001FOXYJO,A22TE94IK3PAKD,6/13/08,5,5,5,Coffee Review,"Came across this coffee in a hotel in Kazakhstan during a business visit. Really enjoyed it ,but it is not available in Australia to the consumer. Found it on Amazon, and now have it every morning.If you like coffee with real ""guts"" and a bit of flavour but none of that bitterness, this is the one."
08	47602,B001FOXYJO,A3ND6FPSRJ4L6I,12/31/08,3,3,5,A Real Delight,"We have tried many coffees and a number of home coffee makers but have  been unable to brew anything to match the quality of the coffees we enjoy in our favorite restaurants. But this morning we tried the Carte Noire given us as a Christmas gift. What a delightful surprise. It has that ""blackness"" that we associate with good coffee but none of the bitterness. It is unquestionably the best coffee we have ever made at home. And with a small addition of Irish Creme syrup (another Christmas present), it was simply quite wonderful."
08	2627,B0016FY6H6,A2YQCZEHOJZLQL,9/1/08,2,2,5,Great health benefits,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
08	2079,B001E5E29A,A1K63DKY43ROJ6,1/15/08,1,5,5,"Don't buy any other, this is the best!",I hope Amazon always carries this product too. I have ordered it twice. Excellent product for the price. Yum-O!
08	576,B000G6RYNE,AX7K82LNPVATT,10/2/08,2,2,5,Good chips,I bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.
08	61133,B000FA38ZY,AMWBLUZ6SQ6ZP,3/2/08,4,6,5,Great cookies!!,"The price is very reasonable for a case of these cookies (12 boxes), especially when you factor in the free shipping!  They arrived promptly, in perfect condition, and are delicious!"
08	18494,B000LKTSZM,A360OAQUH18QAJ,9/6/08,7,7,5,Lovely Treat - Not Too Sweet!,"These cookies are our favorite summer treat - we keep them in the freezer so they get a cool soft crunch. They are sweet in that european way, so your teeth don't hurt when you eat them! I am a health conscious sugar addict (a tough combo!) and these fit the bill just right when I cannot bake my own desserts. We love the fresh lemony flavor after a meal, or as a mid-afternoon snack.<br /><br />If you like very sugary sweets, you probably won't like these. However,  if you want to wean yourself (or your kids!) off of a lot of white sugar intake, you might want to give these a try! A pack of 12 goes faster than you think..."
08	9516,B0001M10OW,A3L2G0OLGPX59,8/8/08,4,4,5,"aluminum free, have used Rumford's for years","I couldn't find Rumford's at the grocery, just found brands with aluminum, but of course Amazon has it!  I have used this brand since I started cooking as a child at my parents' house."
08	26151,B0058AMY74,AX7K82LNPVATT,10/2/08,2,2,5,Good chips,I bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.
08	9517,B0001M10OW,A1ZY80FK93W602,6/29/08,4,4,5,The only baking powder I will use.,"I learned to use Rumford from my Mother.  She could always taste the baking powder if another one was used.  Therefore, we never had Calumet in the house."
08	20193,B000F42ECI,A28SPLHJ7STNG4,8/30/08,1,1,5,Nice Tea,"Worth the extra money if you love good tea...since the extra money isn't too much extra like it is going from, say, a Chevy to a Cadillac.  It's a solid consistent flavour...not harsh like other brands."
08	20194,B000F42ECI,A3JAV0VWEE8L11,4/26/08,1,1,5,Delicious traditional tea,Just like the tea I remember from childhood.  Large tea bags that allow the flavour to flow fully and perfectly.  Nothing like it available anywhere.  This is real tea!
08	76703,B0049ULB78,ADUN9X5PQXZXM,1/9/08,0,0,3,"Bold for Green Mountain, but not BOLD","If you are looking for a BOLD k-cup, try the Coffee People ""black tiger"" or their ""french roast"" bold... they are about the closest thing to a cup of Starbucks that you can get in a k-cup.  This is fine if you like Green Mountain, McDonalds, or Dunkin' Doughnuts coffee.  It has a classic GM slight nutty/sweet taste that I am not overly fond of but it is okay for an evening cup or when you are in the mood for something lighter."
08	76702,B0049ULB78,AUGSUXZXOIRQZ,2/16/08,0,0,5,Can't beat the price,These are great if you like your coffee strong.  The price is fantastic compared to department stores.  I love my k-cups.
08	76701,B0049ULB78,A24HELOL6MJKMF,2/24/08,0,0,5,WONDERFUL,THIS COFFEE IS PERFECT FOR ME. BEFORE I GOT THE K-CUP COFFEE MAKER I ENJOYED STRONG COFFEE.  I TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF K-CUPS AND ALWAYS GO BACK TO THIS ONE.  IT HAS GOOD FLAVOR AND STRENGTH TO SATISFY ME.
08	76700,B0049ULB78,A7S0SH4IKOVIV,4/21/08,0,0,5,Coffee,It had a great variety and I am not much of a coffee maker but I have to admit I enjoyed this coffee very much!  I will be ordering again

08	2160,B000N5XCPM,A2H1JEGK2YBTSZ,1/19/08,13,13,1,Half-empty cans and greasy inconsistent ingredients,"We have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year.  Over the past few months, we have had a problem with the cases of Grammy's Pot Pie cans.  Some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard-like gravy with no veggies, and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies,etc. What happened to truth in labeling?  We also had the problem with the cans being only half-full sometimes. Our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them Merrick.<br />  They need to start testing their food again.  It used to be great.  Look at the old reviews from last year and before."
08	47632,B000GX7MB6,A1WKD2KQ9V42QI,2/7/08,1,1,5,Healthy and cat loves it!,This is a great product that I will definitely buy again.  I was looking for a product that only contained seafood with no animal byproducts.  My cat just loves this tasty food.
08	34125,B000UBJL4U,A387QQXN7BJ3ZQ,2/29/08,2,2,5,1000 Island Dressing Packets,I really like this product. It is easy to throw in lunch bag and go. It taste good. Recommend this purchase.

08	15653,B0000CDBRJ,A17U4B8TMIO3V4,1/20/08,4,4,5,Chef Paul Prudhomme's Best Seasoning,"I've been experimenting with Cajun food for quite sometime. I've talked with several different Creole Chefs and two of the three that I have spoked with have recommended this seasoning over any other. From now on, this is the only Creole seasoning I use on any meat. I've bought the variety pack of Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and nothing really stuck out like this one. If you have been using Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and haven't purchased this one, you are in for a treat. I can't find this specific product in the stores, which makes the 24-oz can a great buy."
08	15654,B0000CDBRJ,A2UVYJXK9DSGR,1/7/08,4,4,5,Wonderfully Versatile!,"We absolutely love this seasoning. I worked years ago in a restaurant, and this is the seasoning they would put on fish, chicken and beef. It adds a lot of flavor, without adding a lot of fat and calories. We use it for veggies, soups, fish, you name it.<br />We can't seem to keep it in the house, and at approx $5.00 for a small bottle from the market, this large canister is a much better deal. It should last us a good long time."
08	34134,B000UBJL4U,A180S4B0BIGODQ,11/15/08,1,3,1,Too rich for my blood,"The cost for this product including shipping is way too rick for my blood. From now on, I'll make my own dressing."

08	55120,B001GVIUXQ,A297OARE76DMYM,12/11/08,18,19,5,My cat actually loves it......,"...and he hates everything. I fed my cat Iam's for years, because his vet reccomended it and therefore I figured it must be the best for him, but after the cat food scare, I wanted to get out of all the traditional brands. The vet reccomended another brand, which I cannot think of the name right now... that you can buy at PetSmart. It was pretty pricey - about $28 for a 64 oz bag. My cat hated it, he refused to eat it, and it looked wooden.But I took him to a playdate at a friends and he has this habit of eating out everyone's bowl and came across Newman's Own in his friend's food bowl. He loved it! My friend sent me home with enough to transition him and I ordered a bag instantly from Amazon. And if you are looking to go organic with your kitty, comparatively, the price for Newman's Own is right. Much cheaper than those in the same class."
08	55119,B001GVIUXQ,A278535AIRIJMV,6/11/08,19,19,5,great cat food!,I bought Newman's Own after the cat chow scare as well but was surprised at the change in my cat's behavior and activity level within the first month of the switch. I wish it were available nearby but I'm signing up for the auto ship which gives you free shipping and a lower price. My cats love the flavor and respond well to the nutrition and absence of processing in their food. I know how lethargic I feel when I get busy and eat too much processed food-why would they react any differently? It's well worth the money-I've tried cat chow naturals and while it is better than regular it does not produce the level of improvement that PN does so I'm sticking with the good stuff!
08	40807,B000RY5EVO,A1RNLLGO1FK5CT,4/14/08,3,3,5,Best spiedie sauce,"I spent over 20 years in the Binghamton area and although there are several brands of spiedie sauce, this is absolutely the best. If you marinate the meat for a day or more, the flavor is richer and more fantastic! I highly recommend this to ANYONE! Enjoy!"
08	15656,B0000CDBRJ,A1FRKRUFEEJWIT,11/10/08,2,2,5,Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Redfish Magic,I absolutely love this product!<br />As a home-chef I use this product on just about all of my seafood. It adds a distinct flavor that that takes any fish or seafood to another level of excellence.<br /><br />Great for even the most basic cooks!
08	40804,B001EO5R2W,A1QTREIIAJM36,8/3/08,1,2,3,A little too sweet,"The product tastes good, but they're a little heavy on the sweetener.  I feel like I'm eating Lucky Charms."

The company has such great values - 10% of all profits go toward peace making efforts, that is why the cereal is higher in price than most cereals.<br /><br />Except for the price, high sodium, low fiber, and small amount in the box, all of the cereal flavors are great tasting! I like it despite these drawbacks because of the peace efforts, the natural ingredients, the freshness, the spices, and the mix of oat clusters and flakes.<br /><br />I especially love the mango passion cereal flavor- it has a great spice flavor, with cardamom! Serve with great tasting soymilk and fresh fruit, and you have a great breakfast! Some flavors (but not all) include: Peace Cereal Mango Passion Low Fat Crisp, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), Peace Cereal Maple Pecan Crisp, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), Peace Cereal Raspberry Ginger Low Fat Crisp, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), Peace Cereal Wild Berry Low Fat Crisp, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), Peace Cereal Apple Cinnamon Crisp, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)"

08	34151,B000P3U70K,ATFWL9M3XVMMK,1/22/08,9,12,4,Baby Hulless popcorn,The popcorn itself is very good but the seller lacks the brains to pack it correctly so when the popcorn came the bag was split and popcorn was spilled all inside the box and leaking out of 1 corner.
08	34155,B000P3U70K,AMAVTQ7CD5A5R,1/1/08,5,9,5,Prompt delivery,This product arrived on time and in excellent shape. I would order from them again.

The shipping was so much that I figured if I wanted to try them too, I aught to get one for me as well.  They came well packaged and in a very timely manner.  I tried them and they were good tasting and had a good texture.  It didn't seem like the flower bloomed very much in the champagne, however.  But it still looked beautiful in the flute and was fun to look at.  I would recommend these as well as probably purchase them again at some point, I just wish the shipping didn't cost more than the item itself."
08	40797,B001EO5R2W,A2WBE93UGB93FC,1/27/08,2,2,4,Great taste unlike any other cereal!,"I've seen Peace cereals at the store for some time, but was hesitant to buy it because it was expensive (~$4.50). I finally tried it, and it was a great choice! A great taste unlike any other organic cereal I've tried - unique with the cardamom and other spices. It has a nice bite to it, a nice spice about it, and the mango flavor is good too. I'm not as fond of corn flakes as I am of wheat flakes, but these corn flakes are crisp and crunchy. I really like the oat clusters. I also tried the Raspberry Ginger Peace cereal and it was just as good and unique.<br /><br />Only two downsides (which is why I rate this a 4) -<br />1. not many servings - it says 7 servings, but I usually just get 4 (and I measure)<br />2. high sodium for cereal - why does cereal need that much sodium? Most of the cereals I buy have no sodium.<br />3. Ok so there is a 3rd reason - the price."

I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.

I was happy to see that I could buy at a cheaper price at Amazon.com from a different seller than Bolivia Stores but it was a nightmare, please be careful and aware of this facts:<br /><br />I order a coca tea box from Bolivia Exports, the package was very late and took over two weeks for arrival when I got used to the ""less than a week USA shipping"", this package was mailed directly from Bolivia and not from North Carolina where I usually get my coca products shipped from. I received a custom open package with green tape all over, tea bags where opened and ripped apart, the box was cut open all around and I can send as many pictures as required..... but the worse part is that with it , I got a Custom, DEA and FDA warning letters that the coca tea box was getting in the United States without licences for schedule II substances from a no registered seller for what it was a 100% illegal package from Bolivia that I needed to sign for and get my name as importer of ILEGAL GOODS; the product was not intended for human consumptions because it was not from a FDA certified location.<br />How is possible that Amazon can aloud sellers without licencing for controlled substances and food in its pages??? I called ""Bolivia Stores"" and found out that they are an American company with all paperwork, licencing, FDA registered facilities and permissions while this is a different seller from Bolivia not linked to them in any way.<br /><br />I want my money back, I receive a product that cannot be used and I will contact my credit card company with the complain also but now, who fix the problem I have with Customs US???<br /><br />I tried to save a few dollars and got a whole headache and lost every penny in a tea that cannot be drink"

Both my dogs and my cats love the food and have been on it since they were 4 months old. My younger cat was very sick when I brought her home and I was nervous about putting her on a vegei diet until she was well. My Vet uses this product and recommended that I switch right away because it's such a high quality food. Once I put her on Evolution she had a speedy recovery. Everyone that has had contact with my pets have made comments on how beautiful their fur is.

08	55118,B001GVIUXQ,A360EFJOE4L7IZ,5/21/08,70,70,5,Good for cats - Loved by cats,"Approximately 20 years ago, I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet.  Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS).  I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies.<br /><br />I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died.<br /><br />Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine.  More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled.  IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro.<br /><br />I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust.  I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic.  Newman's Own is both natural and organic.  It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Amazon.<br /><br />My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food.  They also love Innova EVO.  I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Peace of mind<br />2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands<br />3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants<br />4. The cats love it<br />5. Does not cause the other digestive problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands<br />2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.  And I can now add Amazon to my list of sources for the food."
08	61234,B000HAAAKI,A3H9P1J84V6OW9,4/13/08,4,5,5,An experience worth having.,"This tea has a smoothe earthy flavor. It definitely fits into the catagory of organic health foods for its purported nutritional content as well.  The energy I personally felt was very subtle, not much like so many dietary supplements and drinks out there that gets one juiced up to the point of jitters. If taken for the first time, a slight numbing sensation can be felt in the mouth and throat areas.  The sensitivity to the numbing sensation appears to fade a bit with ongoing consumption. As far as an appetite suppressant for me, it works to a slight degree, probably depending on the amount. According to one coca tea blogspot website, the coca leaf contains 14 alkaloids:  Atropine, Inuline, Benzoyne, Reserpine, Cocamine, Conine, Quinoline, Pyridine, Globuline, Hygrine, Papaine, Pectin, Egnonin, and Cocaine--one gram of crushed leaves contains 5.3mg of which only 4.42mg of it is released during a 3 minute steep in 180ml of hot water.<br /><br />  Of the listed alkaloids, Cocamine is becoming popular in dietary supplement blends that are geared towards those needing energy for workouts and such.  From my personal experience ALRI's Venom Hyperdrive is a good synergistic blend of vitamin b-12, cocamine,hoodia gordinii, etc. that have worked well for me in getting appetite supression and high energy for workouts.<br /><br />  By the way, the natives supposedly use a minute amount of an alkalinic additive to enhance the potency (by improving extraction) of the coca leaf's alkaloids.  They are little ash/lime balls called Llipita(available online) and they can be pulverized and sprinkled upon your beverage like pinches of salt. Oh, and what a conversation piece--a definite novel-tea!"

It felt mildly stimulant, but not pleasant.<br />When I came accross the coca tea in Amazon.com, I was so surprised that I decided to try it.<br />I was sure it was thoroughly decocainized, so I doubted I was going to enjoy the Freudian benefits, but I hoped for traces of the alkaloid being left behind.<br />The tea does contain cocaine, but so little that it doesn't make you feel high. Instead, for me and my partner at least, the tea is as calming as alertness promoting. It is mildly stimulant, but at the same time one feels relaxed and somehow more in control.<br />The flavor of Windsor tea is much more pleasant than that of green tea and is also more complex. No wonder Coca Cola still uses the plant (??).<br />Will it still be legal next time I, an adult, decide to buy a new box? Certainly hope so."

08	61247,B000HAAAKI,A27PNFMGPK0IG3,3/23/08,5,14,3,Windsor Coca Tea Not So Great,"Well, it just came yesterday, 100 tea bags of Windsor, supposed to be the best. I made a pitcher of 20 tea bags by boiling the water, boiling again, letting it sit, putting a tea bag in my mouth and sucking and see if it would numb it. No not noticible at all, no wonder its legal in the US, stupid Coca tea! I heard if you put 3 in your mouth and suck on it for a while it will get numb, but I don't feel like doing that. I'm on my 3rd cup of iced tea today and I think I'm gonna just get a sugar-free monstor or drink expresso. Do I feel stimulated? Slightly. Do I feel sober? Yes. Alert? Yes. Energetic? Not particularly, and the fact its 65 degrees in the house doesn't help, I like warmth. Is it real Coca leaves? Yes, but dried and apparently from my research it would take 100 bags to equal 1 gram of coke. Does that mean 100 bags of fresh? I dont know. Why is it legal? Because there are not enough alkaloids in the tea to be considered an illegal substance, kinda like poppy seeds or the essence of coca you will see in the ingredients of coca-cola. It's also known to calm the cravings of cocaine users, although I don't have cravings any way, but if you do it's recommended.<br /><br />I'm now brewing one cup with 3 bags and seeing if I can tell anything...I pour the boiling water on the 3 bags. It has a nice green grassy color, similiar to green tea. It's quite delicious and as I drink it down my mood is slightly lifted, heart beat increases, but no more than with caffeine. Is it like cocaine? No, not at all and if you buy the tea hoping it's going to be that way, you've got another thing coming and will be very disappointed. I knew all this before I decided to try this. I'm not disappointed, yet not entirely enthusiastic about it either.<br /><br />It's a good alternative for thoughs who don't like coffee, it has a vast amount of vitamins, minerals and health benefits and is certainly better for you than caffeine. Also, surprisingly, no jitters like with coffee. Is it like doing a drug? No, not at all, I feel completely sober, yet my spirits are lifted a bit and a slight tingle, but it could be b/c I'm trying to feel something. I can see why it would be legal in the U.S not to mention it helps the trade commission in a safe legal way. And I'm not just saying that to keep it legal, everything I read about it not being anything like a drug has been true. I just didn't know until I tried it.<br /><br />After drinking the entire pitcher I was very giddy, but that was probably just the mood I was in naturally.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably not, it's rather expensive. I'll just drink my cuban expresso, I like caffeine better than coca tea."

Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could."

It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"

I take for lunch and toast and very filling and easy but cheaper than going to fast food places.  I use for mini pizzas, Hamburg buns, bacon, egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast, chicken sandwiches, etc.  Easy to take on trips or friends and family to eat. Must toast or bake for best favor."

The response I got from them regarding the no-show? ""Oh, did you want to re-order it?"" Uh, NO! I had to tell them they needed to return my money asap, which they did do (the very least). I will never do business with this company again and if their ratings are to believed, I'm not the only one very unhappy with them lately. I gave them a single star only because they did return my money."
08	26086,B0058AMY74,A2ZCD6KO2YY9IZ,1/18/08,2,4,5,Tasty,Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
08	4629,B000FFRY3G,A1NFSGHFUATGD5,5/21/08,2,2,5,Great value for the cost...,How can you go wrong with buying these in bulk for less than $3 per unit when they can run as high as $5 per unit retail?
08	6030,B001E2FMLK,A36L67ICIQD3LG,5/29/08,8,8,1,Ridiculous price,The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.

The flavor enhances all your seafood and just makes it wonderful.  Plus, these are great just to snack on out of the bag.  Kids love them!  We use them for chilis, soups, and recipes as well.  Highly recommend!"

08	50565,B0000DGG22,A1W3GOMXOSLF5A,7/6/08,7,7,5,Nice Gift,We bought a package deal- a redwood and a grove.  They were shipped quickly and arrived healthy.  My sister and her husband appreciate the fact the bonsai can live outside their small home in the California foothills.

My cats eat anything that doesn't run away from them, but everyone from the year old cat, to the seventeen year old diabetic kitty LOVED this food. Even my mom's cat, who is known to be pretty finicky loved it.<br /><br />The food looks like ""real"" food, not the loaf-type food so often seen in canned cat food, and it smells great. Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up, and I like that there is plenty of broth and liquid on the food, because that helps my eldest cat, who is missing several teeth, eat it just fine.<br /><br />I've been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food. This ranks right alongside those expensive foods. Good stuff!!!!"

My experiences with tea have been limited to Lipton, Community, some Bigelow, Celestial Seasonings and whatever brand that happens to be in use at the restuarants I visit.  With Rishi's Earl Grey, I ventured into my first loose leaf tea experience.<br /><br />Culled from 1300 year old trees of the Yunnan mountain villages, this Earl Grey is strong, almost sweetened coffee-like in taste.  If there's no coffee around, this tea would be my next choice.  It contains bergamot oil as well.  It has a stout aroma that hits you before you even open the inner lid of the container.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea to fans of dark teas in general, as well as folks like myself who are more familiar with coffee and biscuits than tea and crumpets."

08	58648,B0013P3KC6,ATFA4TVG4C8HU,12/31/08,177,180,5,Great Sweetener but learn about the product,"I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility."
08	20246,B001BDDTB2,A2CV33795L4KHH,11/25/08,3,4,3,Mixed reviews from the house felines,"Dash loves it. Jasper does not. Dash Hoovered both his bowl and Jasper's, while Jasper took two bites and then moved over to the kibble bowl. We've tried three different flavors so far, and the verdict has been the same. So safe to say, not ALL cats want to eat ""people food."" I don't know much about this product except what's on the label. The fact that it's a product of Thailand concerns me a bit -- I don't know what their standards are for pet food, and after the scandal with the lead in Chinese-manufactured toys, well, I'm a little skeptical. It's also an expensive product. Since I don't have a consensus among the house felines, I doubt I will purchase any more of this product."
08	50564,B0000DGG22,A3UOH6YXUDBV0B,5/19/08,8,8,5,Stunning,"Back in March I ordered four dawn redwoods from a nursery on Ebay, all about 2-3 feet tall.  They arrived bareroot and healthy.  The plan was to plant three in the ground to replace trees uprooted by Katrina.  The fourth was to go into a pot to be trained as bonsai.  All four trees were thriving, but the one in the pot looked like a plant that yearned to join the rest of its family out in the yard, rather than being forested with my bonsai collection.  Clearly, it was going to take time, patience, and training to get it to look like a bonsai.  I decided to put it in the ground and order a Brussels Dawn Redwood.<br /><br />And I'm glad I did.  The Brussels tree is a long way from a specimen, but it already looks like a bonsai, a mature-looking but minature redwood with beatuiful tapered trunk and gorgeous lower branching, all of which was lacking in the nursery tree, which had arrived pruned to favor topgrowth.  The Brussels Dawn redwood is absolutely stunning, far superior to the tree pictured on Amazon.<br /><br />Sure, the nursery tree would have acquired this look--eventually, and after much training.  But it loves growing with its kinfolk in the yard, and meanwhile I have this beautifully shaped little tree from Brussels to marvel at every time I sit outside with my bonsai collection.  Frankly, I can't take my eyes off it.<br /><br />I'm neither impatient by nature nor a champion of acting on impulse.  But there are times when instant gratification and acting on impulse has its rewards, and this was one of them.  The Brussels Dawn Redwood looks like a tree, not a seedling.  It is nothing short of breathtaking."
08	50563,B0000DGG22,A15CL28ALB7MTZ,7/21/08,13,14,5,"Fabulous, even better than the example picture","The base of the tree was thicker than the one shown in the picture.  The I received has a nice taper.  A nice touch, there was a little bit of moss growing over the dirt.<br /><br />The tree came packaged in a tall box with an inner Styrofoam base to protect the pot.  The pot and base of the tree were wrapped tight in a thick plastic and the soil was damp upon arrival.  The rest of the space inside the box was filled with a biodegradable type of foam peanuts (watch out, they get everywhere when you take the tree out).<br /><br />Fantastic tree!"
08	20248,B001BDDTB2,A1AEPMPA12GUJ7,11/27/08,2,3,3,"If your cat likes people food, this may be for you.","My cat George never quite finishes a 6-ounce can of cat food, so I thought I would try these 3-ounce servings. However, George is not terribly fond of people food, and he has only finished one of the cans that I have given him so far - the Sesame Chicken, as it turns out. He clearly likes the broth in the Chicken Pot Pie, but he doesn't finish his vegetables, or even all of the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Of course, we can hardly blame him for abandoning one can to attempt to get into the turkey liver I was cutting up. Some people food is too good for cats to pass up!"
08	58649,B0013P3KC6,A1SO1PGDNVMLXC,8/9/08,62,65,4,This is a great product - (Dog owners be careful),"Great product, great company.  High quality xylitol made from corn, not birch.<br /><br />However, this stuff is very toxic to dogs.  Don't let them have any of it, not even small quantities.  If you want a sweetener like this but without such toxicity to dogs, get Erythritol.  Same sort of thing -- a sugar alcohol, but not dangerous for animals.  Also, it does not have the same digestive effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) that Xylitol does.  It is maybe a little less sweet than Xylitol, however.<br />This does not mean it is bad for people - for example, chocolate is fine for people but also toxic to dogs.<br /><br />Note:  When I do buy it, I use this company.  I've ordered Xylitol and Erythritol from them and they were VERY high quality.  When I tried it from EmeraldForest, I found some products had a horrible, strange smell and faint aftertaste.  I called to return the items and was treated very badly by their customer service.  EmeraldForest is getting some of their products made in China (not all - their xylitol apparently not), and I wondered why it has that horrible odor.  Kinda scary.  Also, their customer service is very bad.  If you check their terms and conditions, you will see something sort of unusual for an online merchant:  ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone..."".  When I tried to return the odd smelling product to them citing their money back guarantee, they went around about it and then finally agreed, but said then they would never sell anything to me ever again (!).  Wow.<br /><br />I'm sticking with NOW Foods at this point."

I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it ""smokey tea"" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of ""softens"" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!"

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."

While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you."

The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked!

I have purchased Bonsai trees from other online vendors, but none have compared to this starting with the packing of the tree, you could tell it was packed with great care, it arrived in perfect shape.  The tree is healthy and beautiful, far more beautiful than the picture shown on Amazon. The tree has a wonderful aroma, it smells like your in a forest, on a fall morning.<br />I could tell it was healthy immediately.  Sometimes when you order things on line your disappointed, but not enough to go through the trouble of sending the item back.  The minute I saw this tree I had wished I had ordered more.

Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat."
08	26064,B0058AMY74,A1B05INWIDZ74O,6/10/08,0,0,3,Prefer other flavors,"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."

They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."

Even my 4 year old loves them!"
08	26050,B0058AMY74,A3UCO7B9HP42BG,7/27/08,0,0,5,Great chips,"We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!"
08	26049,B0058AMY74,A3MLESXA2VGWJC,7/29/08,0,0,4,Best sour cream & onion chip I've had,"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."
08	26048,B0058AMY74,A339FKUBFG0VLX,7/29/08,0,0,4,Yummy chips,"These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving."
08	26047,B0058AMY74,A31N6KB160O508,8/26/08,0,0,4,Pretty good tasting chip,It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.
08	26046,B0058AMY74,A17UR3NRLARXCH,9/10/08,0,0,4,"Good chips, more cheese","They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime."
08	17350,B000EVIDUY,AW8U0DTKNSHD9,9/28/08,0,0,5,What a treat for the gluten-free person needing to belong!,"Quick, easy, order and shipping. Wonderful product for those of us that need gluten free foods. Even my friends and family love these brownies. Those I haven't told don't know the difference. Easy to add lots of nuts and other things. YUM!"
08	26045,B0058AMY74,A3B0HXAUWCLSZO,9/14/08,0,0,5,By far my favorite chips,"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close."
08	76459,B001EHHRSG,A2WHUCCJ83HFM8,12/8/08,0,0,5,Tastes yummy!,"As someone who has just started eating gluten free for health reasons, I have had a difficult time finding items that taste like their gluten counterparts. That is, until I found these ice cream cones! I LOVE ice cream and couldn't believe my taste buds when I tried one of these cones. They are awesome! Taste just like the real thing! Any child or adult will love them!"
08	76457,B001EHHRSG,ASIC9IV0ESJ6L,8/18/08,1,1,5,Wow!! what a great item,"I have bought this Gluten Free Cone at my local Health food Store, its taste so good, My son is 5 years old with celiac and he was so happy to have the cones"
08	76453,B001HTKOWC,A1E11EK6AQ5VF,9/5/08,1,1,5,Stash premium green tea,One of the best invidually bagged green teas.  I am picky but I enjoy this tea.
08	76452,B001HTKOWC,A35GBIZLQST4GK,11/21/08,1,1,5,Stash tea,I am very pleased with the Stash tea I purchased.  It was a VERY good deal & the quality is excellent
08	76451,B001HTKOWC,A2V18JN5XI2GOB,11/28/08,1,1,5,Good Stuff.,"I like this better than the Bigelow that I was drinking before and the price is really good.  This is actually the first tea of any kind that I've been able to drink without adding artificial sweetener or honey.  It has a nice subtle flavor and, on a wholly superficial note, the beautiful green individual packages look lovely in a glass container on the counter."
08	76450,B001HTKOWC,A24LLQD11VVTPU,12/17/08,1,1,5,the best tea,I never liked plain  green tea.  I thought I  would try  this white/ green tea combo. I love it ! and the health benefits are great also. The more you drink of it the better  (also weight loss)
08	55466,B000EGUYOM,A2O7L5AJOLEU3X,12/22/08,0,0,5,"DELICIOUS, AND HEALTHY TO BOOT!  :-)",These are fantastic - and SO much better than regular old pumpkin seeds.  For someone that doesn't eat a lot of meat and needs more protein alternatives - this is GREAT!
08	85067,B003F6YLUQ,A23Y4K8MNEK4C2,1/30/08,0,0,1,do you like water?,"i am a fan of the tassimo machine, and many of the t-discs.  however the signature blend should be retitled the signature bland.  perhaps i just look a fuller bodied coffee particularly in the morning, but this one was exceptionally disappointing to me... take note of the different roast levels posted on tassimos website before buying discs that cost about $.50-$.75 per cup..."
08	19216,B001E5E20O,A3FKPBNI7UWQFW,11/20/08,0,0,5,Another fabulous Rishi Tea!,"This smooth black Earl Grey is a classic. Just the right amount of Bergamot oil. The brew isn't bitter, even if you over steep. Smooth and rich, but not heavy. I often reach for this tea on chilly mornings.<br /><br />Is this review helpful? Let me know, please vote. :-)"
08	52847,B0000DIXKU,AQYUQ4HRHWYZD,1/12/08,10,28,1,Ugghhhhhh!!!!!,The smoked salmon was absolutely disgusting.  The box is very neat but also put together very poorly in CHINA!  I would not recommend buying this.  Don't waste your money.
08	55462,B000EGUYOM,A2POU2NI9UJJPW,11/10/08,12,16,1,"Delicious, healthy...Product of China?!","This product is portrayed as healthy and natural, but I was shocked and dismayed to see that it's shipped from halfway across the world. I understand buying electronics, shoes, etc. from China, but my FOOD? I doubt the safety of this food product, and don't see how they can guarantee that  it's vegan, non-GMO, dairy free, wheat-free, gluten-free, etc. Plus I don't see the point in purchasing something that has obviously left such a hefty carbon footprint. But beyond that, how hard is it to make a delicious snack like this in the USA, from USA-grown ingredients? Seriously?"
08	61389,B001EO5R04,A1B54NV7RNRBO4,1/5/08,4,4,5,My favorite!,"I've started each morning off with this particular tea for the last 5 or 6 years. I love this tea. I went from a coffee drinker to a green tea drinker because of this tea. It has nice a strong flavor that I simply adore. (I make it much stronger then suggested, I love bitter tastes! Then I just add hot water to the leaves for the second cup, and it is as good as the first!) I have been purchasing this from Stash directly for years, but it is a better deal on Amazon."
08	17040,B000PIQF8S,A1NZ9YAQP6GN9V,5/20/08,2,2,5,Hawkin's Cheesies...bliss in a bag,"My best friend (from Canada) turned me on to these; addictive isn't a strong enough word. REAL cheese, not sprayed-on dehydrated cheese flavored chemicals! When you first open the bag, the powerful cheese aroma hits you right where you live.<br /><br />One word of warning: bookmark this store, because once you have Hawkin's Cheesies you will never want to sully your tastebuds with any other cheese snack. Ever."
08	17039,B000PIQF8S,A2V39MALUEV6LV,12/7/08,2,2,5,Snack Nirvana,"By far the best snack food ever.  If you ever are in Canada you must load up on these and bring them home.  Price here at Amazon is a little rich.  Beware these can be very, very addictive."
08	4635,B000FFRY3G,A2EKKYK6LJT4YV,9/2/08,0,0,1,Mushy English Muffins,"The Ener-G Foods English muffins look good in the packaging, but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom.  This presents a gooy feel in the mouth, and both my husband and I got stomach aches.  Won't be buying this again."
08	61394,B001EO5R04,A3KY6HIM0HCIGG,1/21/08,3,3,5,Excellent breakfast tea!,"I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.  If you only have a little left in the tin, it blends well with any other black tea."
08	4637,B000FFRY3G,A1XG6TC70LQUL6,6/24/08,1,2,1,These are English muffins??,"If you are looking for  English muffins - go to the grocery store and buy them.  These do not even resemble English muffins and are tasteless.  However, if you are on a restricted diet (wheat flour, soy, dairy, gluten,etc.) these might be for you - check the list of ingredients.  I didn't care for them at all."
08	40691,B000E48IXS,A3HAM8QICUJLVN,5/26/08,0,0,3,Bledie lekker is a bit of an overstatement,I bought this droewors when I was craving a taste of home. The other products I bought were great but this wors isn't the best I've ever had. It's a little bit plastic tasting and leaves a sort of coating in your mouth. It's also rather thick; the wors I typically prefer is thinner. Bledie Lekker (which means bloody tasty) isn't the worst I've ever had but it's not my favorite and I'd probably try other brands before buying this one again.
08	51582,B004HOLD92,A3391JPWZU0WQB,2/6/08,2,2,5,Best Blue Diamond Almonds,"I have tried most of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and I have to say this one is my FAVORITE!!!  Once I start eating these almonds, it's hard to stop.  YUMMY!!!"
08	51581,B004HOLD92,A23NU62LLXAJ5H,8/15/08,2,2,4,Satisfied Taster,"I love salt & vinegar chips and I love Blue Diamond almonds so I was delighted to find a combination of the two.  They make a great snack and a great substitute for chips with a sandwich.  They are a little tart and a little sweet, YUMMY!"

I've tried lot of different sorts/tastes of coffee from cheap to exclusively expensive, but this one remains one of my faorite for years.<br />Great Coffee! Worth to try and you will not be disappointed!"
08	52101,B000B6CYLG,A1EG1E68A3AQH0,7/4/08,1,1,5,Absolutely fantastic,"This is one of the best sauces I ever had. I just about fits to everything. Whether it's beef, lamb, pork, fish or poultry. Really great stuff."
08	52099,B000B6CYLG,A1IV194W97KZ8Z,7/2/08,4,4,5,Great sauce for fish or chicken!,"This sauce makes it so easy to make fish and chicken taste so much more interesting.  It is a unique blend of sweet and spicy (but not too spicy)!  I usually saute fish in a little olive oil.  When just about finished, I add a little of this sauce over the top and then turn the fish over for a minute or two.  It is that easy!<br /><br />I have given away many bottles of this sauce to friends and they end up loving it too..."
08	76403,B001HTKOWC,A31Z6A9QECVMCN,4/6/08,2,2,5,Best Tea,This is definitly my favorite chai tea. Not too expensive and very tasty! The chai black tea is also quite wonderful.
08	76402,B001HTKOWC,A2YDG8QP57UDE3,6/15/08,2,2,5,Delicious,My local grocery store stopped carrying this brand - but it turns out a better deal through Amazon anyway.  This is my AM beverage of choice!
08	76401,B001HTKOWC,A2IPHGXIAYZNJK,8/24/08,2,2,5,Wake Up Call,My wife and I enjoy a pot of Green Chai Tea each morning.  It has a great flavor.  It is a little hard to find in grocery stores at the quantity that we like.  Hint... set it up as a subscription and you will pay less than most grocery stores and you will have it delivered to your door.
08	76400,B001HTKOWC,AC8UT5SYUP313,11/15/08,2,2,4,Yum!,The Moroccan Mint Green Tea by Stash is simply delightful.  I generally enjoy 1-3 cups a day (considering I have six boxes to consume) and each one is delicious.  The mint and lemongrass keep the tea from being too astringent.
08	76399,B001HTKOWC,A8IF4ZBZRY86C,12/15/08,2,2,5,this is excellent chai green tea,i love the Stash Chai i couldnt believe this was green tea. i'll drink it when its this good. highly recommend all the chai's but this one is very good.
08	19215,B001E5E20O,AQHX3MG6JY68,11/25/08,0,0,4,great tea,This tea is sooo good and you are drinking pure organic -  That is a good thing- I've tried other brands of loose tea and there is no comparison to the taste quality -  This is really good<br />All you need is a tea ball - and time to relax -<br />Try it - This Earl Grey is a keeper-

08	61401,B001EO5R04,A1LZJZIHUPLDV4,10/22/08,2,2,5,Vegan Organic Kosher Choice,"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Very smooth taste. Medium dark color. Great tea and brand. Economical. Assam can be a wonderful place to visit when calm. Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand.

08	61403,B001EO5R04,A3DWLW7WWFKE6D,6/2/08,2,2,4,good but pricey,"A friend requested loose Jasmine tea for her birthday and there weren't many options. Being in a hurry, I bought it, keeping one of the 3 packs for myself. I think the price is rather high, but the package zip locks, and the favor is nice. Strong enough to know it's jasmine, but not annoying."

It was unavailable at my local health food store, but I found it on Amazon.  Their price and service are excellent.  I would definitely recommend this tea!"

08	19214,B001E5E20O,A2RK3QEUEFRNAN,12/21/08,0,0,5,"Bold, beautiful, and worth changing for.","A very rich flavor, I am biased as I like Earl Grey Tea.  It's great for an after dinner tea, a little too heavy (for me) to be used in the early morning.  I found Rishi Tea to be flavorful and robust.  I wasn't previously a loose leaf tea drinker, but I'm now looking for the perfect set so I can start brewing the leaves at work.  It's also a perfect tea for the heavy coffee drinker who is looking for something different once-in-a-while.  Highly recommended."
08	56094,B000LEBOIC,A1BPFGV0MHQ1AX,6/17/08,0,4,1,Bland,Not what I expected. From the taste I honestly thought it might be a vegetarian concoction.<br /><br />I will not buy again.
08	13021,B000EVT04C,A6X3R4N4XNPNO,7/4/08,0,6,1,Poor Quality and Taste,"I have purchased these gummi candies in the past and not had a problem, but these strawberries tasted terrible and I ended throwing them out."
08	76378,B001HTKOWC,A2L7GN7U5A40AW,9/30/08,4,4,5,delicious,I have tasted several brands of the Jasmine Green tea and found this to be my favorite.
08	76375,B001HTKOWC,A3E68E8YZ6E6FP,10/27/08,9,11,5,My favorite Green Tea,"I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!"
08	17035,B000PIQF8S,A1EE4BTPTHCZZH,4/6/08,3,3,5,best cheezies ever made!,"My whole family loves these cheezies.  There is no replacement for this brand when you want a crispy, excellent tasting cheezie!"
08	76370,B001HTKOWC,A1VOFRFCMKAJ4E,6/8/08,1,5,5,Very Pleased,Very pleased with the product and the lightning delivery...I've shopped thru Amazon for years and I've never had a negative experience.
08	18476,B000BZ6LXO,APG03WQKK81II,4/7/08,2,3,5,Gnats??,I have used this brand potting mix now for 3 seasons and had no problems at all. It is the only potting mix I use now and I've seen no signs of any form  of bug. I do get it in the bigger bags but I'm not sure that would make a difference.
08	51558,B004HOLD92,A361PLXEWB9UC1,3/25/08,3,3,5,reallllllly good,first of all -- they're good.  really good.  go back for more and lick the bowl when they're gone - good.<br /><br />That said -- they're not quite as bold as you might hope.  I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.<br /><br />And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.
08	51557,B004HOLD92,A35USKFKAVA0GI,9/10/08,3,3,5,Awwesome!!,I absolutely love these salt and vinegar almonds!!!<br />Being a fan of salt and vinegar potato chips when I saw these I knew I had to try them. Finished off the can within a couple days!! These are truly very good!!  My only problem is I couldn't find them again in any store around here so I remembered my fav place to shop Amazon.com and knew they wouldn't fail me! Thank you!!
08	61416,B001EO5R04,A3MABADRI0B300,9/5/08,1,1,2,Bland,"Expected good, full flavor from this tea, recently having finished 2 packets of Japanese Gyokuro. It is bland, and the color of the steeped tea, an unattractive dark brown - with no hint of green."
08	76357,B001HTKOWC,AP6OL1S616QPD,11/3/08,7,8,5,My favorite tea,I drink two cups of this tea every day.  This is my favorite tea and I have been a tea drinker all of my life. A very smooth cup of tea!
08	52097,B000OWG5D0,A3RPKAMC302KRC,11/3/08,0,0,5,Excellent price!,The shipping was very fast!My dogs love these treats! This is the best price I have ever found for them! Will order from again!
08	76353,B001HTKOWC,A3NKRBAWSVGMLA,2/23/08,9,10,5,This is the tea that converted me from coffee,"And I was drinking good coffee too. This is my absolute favorite tea. It's great with milk and a splash of honey. I tried other chais, but the spices were often overpowering. This one is so good I bring some with me when I travel, since restaurants rarely have it. If you like this flavor, ordering in bulk is the way to go. The cost per box is almost half that in grocery stores."
08	61417,B001EO5R04,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,7/22/08,1,1,5,Good stuff!!,"Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.  I drink the first mug straight and the rest I put soy milk powder in.  GOOD STUFF.  Will continue to buy this tea."
08	4657,B000FBM4FI,A3KIS7K5BFFZ4B,4/24/08,2,2,4,crackers,"Great alternative for those who can't eat wheat. A little bland, but crunchy and crispy."
08	76349,B001HTKOWC,A14CR6A9AOGMX8,6/25/08,10,10,5,Stash Green Chai Tea is great,The tea tastes great and the price is right.  It has a delightful smell<br />when the envelope is opened and when the tea is brewed.  Green tea has<br />health benefits but the green chai is much more fun to drink than most<br />green teas.
08	13015,B000EVT04C,A2D72VZ2YNPSFG,9/8/08,0,0,5,"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy, I love me some Gummies...",I still haven't eaten all of these. It takes a while to go through five pounds of gummies :)
08	61418,B001EO5R04,A3D9TNJMK7GZYW,1/24/08,1,1,5,The BEST!!!,"This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try."
08	76340,B001HTKOWC,ANNGQJC6V079T,3/9/08,0,0,5,love it iced!,"Such a great tea, glad to see it on Amazon since my local grocers don't carry it.  Totally agree with the other reviewers about how yummy it is.<br />I love it iced, but my FIL likes it hot when he visits."
08	76339,B001HTKOWC,A2J8BAM4AX4FGA,3/28/08,0,0,5,The Best Green Tea,"In my opinion, Stash makes the best Green Tea on the market.  I have tried others and they taste to grassy.  This has a great flavor and makes it easy to enjoy it the health benefits of drinking the tea. Enjoy!"
08	76338,B001HTKOWC,A38OCDJQOAQ2XG,4/8/08,0,0,4,Great Tea,"I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it."
08	76337,B001HTKOWC,AKRXVIOR8O0W7,5/8/08,0,0,5,Best tasting Mint tea for the price,"I go thru a lot of this brand, and hope I can find some more cases on amazon."
08	76336,B001HTKOWC,A1GJQ0NZNNU9HR,9/19/08,0,0,3,Rooibos and nothing more,"Red&White tastes exactly like plain rooibos, which was slightly disappointing since I was expecting something more exotic, thanks to the tea's name. Nonetheless, it's a decent rooibos tea with strong flavor."

Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

She's a bit choosy & will walk away readily from many foods. So, it is really something to watch her just gobble this down!<br /><br />The smaller sized can is nice as well for it insures that she'll eat the whole thing-down to the carrots. With the larger cans, she'll leave a third or more sitting there and it goes to waste.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine may cost a bit more, but nutritionally it is a very good meal for the kitty and she likes it, so none goes uneaten!  So, in the long run, it is a good value.<br /><br />On inspection of the cat food, it is composed of very good ingredients and is a high quality product.<br /><br />Our kitty loves it and gobbles it down at one sitting!"
08	20264,B001BDDTB2,AG90OGHDGOOVH,12/22/08,0,0,4,They Seem to Like It,"Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.<br /><br />This is soft food in the petite cans favored by the feline haute cuisine products. However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or diced, and the sauce is clear with an oily consistency (somewhat like vegetable or olive oil).<br /><br />The boy, Otis, will eat just about any soft cat food put in front of him and we were not disappointed with this product. The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis). I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.<br /><br />Bottom line is that while the cats seem to like the product as much as any other soft food, they don't seem to like it that much more to balance the extra cost."

When you pull off the pop top, you can't help but get splashed by it. And it seems like you're not getting that much food for your money since it's so much liquid. The Chinese chicken is not as liquidy.<br /><br />I have no idea how to compare this to other brands price-wise because it is not sold in my state. I've never seen it in stores."

I put this product in front of her and she ate the whole thing!  So, all I can say is this has to be good.<br /><br />The can are convient, but are single servings.  If you have more than one cat, the packaging is not ""green"" friendly, but the cat/cats will love the food!"

Granted the one cat does like spicy food but he did eat it throughout the days. They both like it but it's hard for them to get a hold of the pieces because the chicken is kind of stringy and not cut into smaller pieces and some of it ends up on the floor.<br /><br />But now that they kind of used to these they do definitely practically yell at me when I don't give them the stuff as soon as I open the can, lol. But it would be better if it were smaller cut pieces to reduce the amount that ends up on the floor."
08	20269,B001BDDTB2,AF3BYMPWKWO8F,12/17/08,0,0,1,Warning: Contains Menadione,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

Sometimes she'll eat a flavor one day, but turn up her nose at it a week later. We vary the flavors, but she's picky. We've been trying the Petite Cuisine for several weeks now, and the four different flavors seem to give her plenty of variety -- she hasn't refused it yet. Here's hoping that continues!"

Cans are small, 2.8 oz each, that is smaller than the fancy feast cans.<br />The food doesn't smell like cat food and looks like people food. The sesame chicken and chicken pot pie were equally liked by my cats. They ate every bite of it, and they never do that with canned food."

My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(."

08	20279,B001BDDTB2,AF74UAKV3Q3W0,12/15/08,0,0,2,The cats weren't impressed!,"When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!"
08	20280,B001BDDTB2,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,12/15/08,0,0,3,"5 star for quality, but 2 for price","This is basically shredded white chicken in a seasoned gravy like broth. ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable."
08	20281,B001BDDTB2,A3L1MEXXDI4Q77,12/13/08,0,0,4,My Cats Love It,"My cats really seem to like this food. It does look like people food (the tuna and shrimp variety even has little shrimps in it). It is quite a bit more expensive than my usual brand of canned cat food (Fancy Feast), but it obviously contains whole seafood, which Fancy Feast does not.<br /><br />I dinged it one star because it is very watery, but otherwise I have no complaints. Unlike some canned cat foods, Petite Cuisine does not smell bad (as long as you don't mind a fishy smell). I would buy this again if I saw it on sale, but I probably wouldn't pay full price for it."

Our cat seems to like it better than her regular canned food, Fancy Feast.  Nutritionally it seems on a par, but at more than a buck a can I wonder whether ""people food for cats"" is really ""ploy for people who think their cats are people.""<br /><br />It is nice to know that, if we're snow bound for a few days, we can eat the cat's food."
08	20283,B001BDDTB2,A122SFGLAHQLSJ,12/10/08,0,0,4,Loved by more than half.,"Out of 4 cats, one simply wouldn't go near it, one liked the broth and played with the food and the remaining 2  liked it immensely (nom nom nom). The cans are a good single serving size and it really smells like human food. Literally, they smell like cold leftovers. The food is in a broth and very wet, which your cat may or may not like. They only similarity in cats is that they are all different.<br /><br />To be fair, the one that didn't like it is insanely picky.  The food is not overly processed and I am happy to feed this to my cats. When I saw that it was made in Thailand, I was a bit wary as we all have heard about the melamine in, well, everything, in China. Then reading further, I saw the company addresses this and says that the food doesn't use Chinese products.  They seem a thoughtful company at the least, which when it comes to pets, goes a long way with me.<br /><br />As good as the food may seem to me, they are the ones that have to eat it.  It's a little more expensive, but not prohibitively so, especially if your cat likes it."
08	20284,B001BDDTB2,A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,12/10/08,0,0,3,It's OK for some cats... But not all.,"Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the ""sauce"" and you might have something here."

He *really* showed great interest in this brand, and liked the amount of juice in the food.  He preferred the chunky chicken in the pot pie flavor rather than the shredded chicken in the sesame entree, but hey he ate both with gusto!<br /><br />So if you have a picky eater, who likes a fair bit of gravy, this could be a winner for you!"

He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).<br /> Nonetheless, we were a bit reluctant to try a new brand of food but no worries there.  With his first can of the Petit Cuisine Chicken Pie we knew we'd found a winner.  He didn't hesitate for a second, not even the unfamiliar smell slowed him down.  He seemed to particularly enjoy the liquid, lapping every bit of it.  A full tummy, a grateful rub of my shin,  and he slept for a few hours.  What a life!<br /> Five purrs for Petite Cuisine!"

08	20287,B001BDDTB2,A306153FTKS9PL,12/7/08,0,0,3,"Good quality, but ultimately it depends on the cat's personality","I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes broth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually ""sesame"". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation, since my cat will not eat the Chinese ""Sesame"" Chicken, I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use -- an issue of the mult-flavor, multi-pack design."

(Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing though!) The chinese chicken she ate, but didnt seem thrilled about. Giving a container to two other cat owners produced the same results. So, if I were to buy in the future, which I very well may, I would hope I could buy a carton of the Chicken Pot Pie by itself. But all in all this is quality food, and seemed to sit in my mature cats stomach easily - very important as all pet owners are still very cautious after last years awful pet food poisonings."

It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12."

It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it."

About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of ""juice"", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.<br />In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.<br />3.5 stars."
08	20291,B001BDDTB2,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,12/6/08,0,0,4,My cats seem to like it,"When reviewing cat food, you really can't go with taste since cat food is disgusting, but my cats really seem to like it. When I open a can they run to the bowl. Not that they don't usually run to the bowl but they are very enthusiastic about this stuff.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that it's in little cans so there's not much. I have three cats. And it's a little too watery. The food and ""gravy"" quotient is heavy on the ""gravy"" side. Also it stinks a little. Most cat food stinks but I distinctly smelled this one. So it stinks more than usual.<br /><br />Beyond that, if you can afford it and you have finicky cats, give it a shot."

They know I make tea for myself nearly everyday, so they are kind enough to keep tea in stock for me.  Being a young American, I had never heard of PG Tips until now, so I am sad that I have been in the dark for so long. The taste and ""texture"" of this tea is absolutely fabulous. I brew it for 2 minutes and it makes a perfect cup without any bitterness, but with a bold smooth flavor. I also add a splash of milk and a bit of sugar or honey... whatever is on hand. I am glad this is becoming widely available in the States and I can see this replacing my regular morning cup of Twinings. I can see why this is the ""#1 tea in the UK."""

I have two cats that primarily eat dry food, yet every once in a while they get a can of something. I tried this brand and was impressed. The meat is visible and appears minimally processed (looks like canned tuna, for example). The cats just love it and are awaiting their next turn!"
08	61504,B0000WKU8K,A32XMT8ULJ5CDV,8/24/08,2,4,4,Had to try it...,"After reading other reviews on this mayo, I had to give it a try.  I grew up on Hellman's mayo, and as another review observed, you will probably prefer what you are used to.  Kewpie mayonnaise has its own distinct flavor, I can't exactly put my finger on what gives it its taste.  I want to try making some deviled eggs with it, I think it would give a nice twist on the flavor.  I also tried Duke's mayo, which is a lot like Hellman's, only with a more pronounced vinegar flavor.  I'm glad I tried both of these, I expect I will use up the Dukes, not sure about the Kewpie mayo.  It recommends using within one month after opening.  But ultimately, I think I'll end up staying with what I am used to, which is Hellman's."
08	20293,B001BDDTB2,A4UFU4WKYEUGO,12/5/08,0,0,4,"A bit watery, but impressive ingredients","With all the nonsense about pet food recalls and melamine, it's important to know where your pet food originates. This food does not originate in China and contains no wheat gluten. The chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down. However, watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food. All three of my cats do eat dry food (Nutro). I like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration. I am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing. The cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in China, and the expensive ones aren't cost effective for me to provide as a snack. This food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can (through Amazon, less through subscribe and save) and it contains high grade (human grade) ingredients. I thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet (BARF for cats). It's messy, requires counter space, time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product. Therefore I try to get the best dry food I can and supplement it with canned food like this.<br /><br />All three cats liked both varieties of food. 3 cats = 2 cans once a day. The dry food is at will - they munch on that when they like. So far, so good. No increased mess in litter box from soupy ingredients, either. Their appetites remain strong for both this wet food and their dry food."

In the herbal tea world, however that doesn't mean you like it all!  Moroccan Mint is THE best tea I've ever tried from any maker.  While not therapeutic, it is very welcome any time of day from that first cup in the morning to the relaxing last hour of the day.  That's why I subscribed to auto ship- so that I won't have to be without."

He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive-stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it."
08	61507,B0000WKU8K,AK4E5XTM2BMY6,10/20/08,1,4,4,Great for sushi making,"As a standard mayo- this tastes a little odd, tangy and a bit less creamy than most Western mayonnaise brands. But, this plus a spicy chili powder called Togarishi are the two main ingredients to many sushi bars' spicy sauce. So if you want to make spicy tuna rolls at home, this is your thing."
08	20295,B001BDDTB2,A13H5US9Z7L9M7,12/4/08,0,0,3,I have three cats,"I typically feed them dry food, and once a day I split a can of Fancy Feast to give them a treat with their supper.<br />They love it. They have never turned down any canned cat food. Sometimes one will refuse or just nibble at a particular flavor, but they usually like their canned food<br /><br />I tried out both flavors on my three kitties, None of them did more than nibble, I tried it on my dog, just out of curiosity, He ate it . Continuing my experiment, I went to my friend Margie's house. She has three cats as well. Much like my feline family, one is a senior and two are young. Sadly, I had the same result. None of them liked it.<br /><br />Before receiving the food I looked online to learn as much as I could about this food before subjecting my furkids to it. Everything looked good, safe and worthy of Morgan, Rosie and Emmie. I was quite disappointed that they don't like it, to tell you the truth. It looked so good that I really wanted them to like it.I will be dropping off the rest of it at the shelter tomorrow. I certainly do not want it to go to waste, as it is a good quality product."
08	20296,B001BDDTB2,A12XHPZ1GIWG8T,12/4/08,0,0,3,One Cat Liked it and One Cat Hated It,"One of my cats liked this food, although not as much as he liked the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food, and my other cat wouldn't touch this food; however, she does like the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety. This variety of food comes with chunks of chicken, chunks of vegetables and gravy. I'm guessing my finicky cat was turned off by the vegetable chunks. On the positive side these cans are easy to open and you can pour the food out without having to use a spoon. However, because one of my cats wouldn't touch this food I won't buy it again. I'll stick with the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food."

One of my cats is very finicky, so I was surprised when she gobbled up this food without hesitation. The cans are small, easy to open, and you don't need a spoon to get the food out. You can easily pour the food out of the can, as it is a mixture of small chunks of seafood and gravy. I divide a can of this food between my two cats morning, lunch and evening, so my cats are eating about a can and a half each of this food daily. My cats' fur is shiny and they are both active and content. I recommend this food and will purchase it again."
08	20298,B001BDDTB2,AZFHSPEZUPGD2,12/4/08,0,0,5,"Looks and smells high-quality, kitty likes it","My cat, who is of average pickiness, loved both of the chicken varieties.<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing, even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half-open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!"
08	20299,B001BDDTB2,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,12/4/08,0,0,3,Too pricey for cat food,"At almost a dollar for one TINY can (the same exact size as a fancy feast) I would personally never buy this product; it just isn't worth it. I was glad that I ended up picking this from the Vine program because my cat did like the Chinese Chicken one. She devoured that in an instant and licked the bowl clean. She wasn't all that impressed with the Chicken Pot Pie. It was very watery and there wasn't much in the can.<br /><br />My cat 99% of the time eats fancy feast, and I usually split the can in half. Half in the morning, half when I get home from work, and half before I go to bed. But with these cans (which, again, are the same size), there is no way you can split them. I gave her the whole can at once. It just isn't worth it, for this price.<br /><br />On the plus side, the food actually smells good-like human food almost. It even looks good-for cat food. Probably one of the best looking types of cat food I've ever come across.<br /><br />So out of 24 expensive cans, my cat likes only half of them. It would be nicer if they had different varieties in the case, not just 2. However, I think for the most part, cats would generally like this cat food."

08	20300,B001BDDTB2,A3UORBSIKQ56ZB,12/3/08,0,0,4,The cats weren't too impressed,"I really wanted to like this product.  I hadn't heard of the brand, so visited the company's website.  I was pleased that the company stated it did not use any ingredients from China, especially in light of the well-publicized problems in that country's food supply.  (I was not, however, pleased to see that the product arrived in a box labeled ""Made in Thailand"".  I would not have willing chosen the food from the store if I had seen that label.)<br /><br />My cats don't eat wet food too often...I tend to think of it as kitty junk food.  But they are always pleased when I serve it, meowing loudly until I get the food onto a plate and down to the floor.<br /><br />On the first day, we tried the Chinese Chicken.  When I opened it, I actually thought it smelled fairly good.  (Not that I was going to taste it, but it did not smell like yucky cat food.)  The chicken was clearly identifiable as white meat chicken with bits of carrot.  The cats' first reaction was to sniff the food cautiously (I assume they were confused by the scent).  The younger cat ate a few bites and walked away.  The older cat (who is fatter and usually licks the plate clean) ate a few more bites, then he was done.<br /><br />On day two, we tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  As I was opening the can, I noticed that it sounded very watery, and upon opening the can, this was confirmed.  The food had chunks of chicken, carrots, and some type of small white bits.  The cats did not like this food as much as the Chinese Chicken.  They licked up the sauce and left.<br /><br />Except for its country of origin, I was pleased with the quality of the food.  The chicken looked like chicken, the carrots like carrots, etc.  At less than a dollar a can, it is comparable to other retail brands.  Unfortunately, my cats don't eat it, so I don't plan on buying it again.  I rated it 4 stars for the company's effort...they can't please every cat's taste buds!"
08	20301,B001BDDTB2,A2W9I628I6SE1U,12/3/08,0,0,4,A Petite Treat,"At first, my cat Timmy was hesitant to try the unusual looking cat food I put before him--a cross between spam and chicken soup. But after he gave it a few sniffs, it was chowed down in minutes. Timmy quickly devoured what appeared to be a delicacy to him.<br /><br />To me, it looked too healthy to appeal to a feline, with its obvious chunks of veggies and solid pieces of meat, nicely moistened by a broth. The can is compact and easy to store and the portion size is just right for one cat's healthy appetite. Normally, a regular can of food like Friskies or Whiskas will only get half eaten, but there was no waste here. The food was polished off with a meticulous licked-clean plate, evidence of Timmy's approval of this latest offering.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is not cheap, but it is on the lower end for the ""gourmet"" cat foods and you get quality ingredients.  Each 4-pack I received also came with coupons worth up to $2 in savings so that is an added bonus.<br /><br />All in all, a good cat food worth it's cost.  Timmy has already put in a request to sample the fish flavors.  :)"

Get out your fork for the Chinese chicken or your spoon for the Chicken Pot Pie & dig in!<br />We have six cats & all six of them loved this!<br />The Chinese chicken is shredded white meat & a little bit of carrots in broth.  Mostly shredded meat.  You can smell the sesame!<br />The Chicken Pot Pie has cubes of white meat in a broth with carrots.  This isn't as filling for the kitties.  They did enjoy the broth a lot!  Later they went back for the meat.  The Chicken Pot Pie would be perfect if for your kitty if you are trying to get kitty to get more liquids in their diet.  One of our males, Door Knob Head, had crystals & blood in his urine.  The vet said it could get really expensive if the first round of treatment didn't work.  It didn't work.  Cats can eventually die from blockage if left untreated.  I researched the condition & got him to drink tons of water.  It fushed him out & he's doing great for many years!  My life would have been a lot easier if I knew about the Chicken Pot Pie.  It would have been the perfect way to get more liquids into him!<br />Each 4 pack box comes with a coupon for $1 off your purchase & if you fill out your info. on that very same coupon, they will mail you another coupon for $1.00 off a future purchase.  Not too shabby!  Yeah, this stuff is pretty darn expensive.  A fine example of you get what you pay for.<br />My only complaint is I would like the option of purchasing one or the other, as in no variety pack.<br />I highly recommend this for your kitties!  Six kitties tested, two kitty parents approve...."

08	20303,B001BDDTB2,A1ST9PG26FSN2H,12/2/08,0,0,4,The fish is better,"The quality of the Petite Cuisine cat food is not the problem.  There is no question that the food is high quality.  There are no meat by-products and if you know what ""by-products"" are you will be happy about that. The problem is that my cats don't seem to like it nearly as much as the fish flavors.  The four cans have only two varieties and my cats weren't thrilled with either one.  In fact, two of my cats don't like these at all.  The sesame chicken is made up of thin strips of chicken which two of my four cats seem to think is tasty enough.  The chicken pot pie is liked by only one cat.  I think the other cats don't like it because it has too much liquid.  The liquid isn't a gravy but rather a watery broth and there is just too much of it.<br /><br />So before you buy this 24 pack size, you will definitely want to try the 4 pack to see if your cats like it.  If they do then this size pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so it is worth it. If they don't then you only lost a few dollars."

The main ingredients are good animal protein sources.<br /><br />There were two flavors in the pack I received:  Chicken pot pie and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken smelled great!  I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.<br /><br />Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.  My cat didn't seem to mind so why should I?  He ate it all.<br /><br />Bottom line...good ingredients, cat likes it.  Five paws up."

08	20305,B001BDDTB2,A2I5QH4F5FDKK5,12/2/08,0,0,5,Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie),"Well, my kitty did not like this at first.  He was really annoyed with me.  Left the food in the bowl and walked away all angry and poofy looking.  Ouch.<br /><br />But, then he came back a little later and starting scarfing.  And from that point on, he's been joyfully eating this.  I'm so glad!<br /><br />The food is very good looking and doesn't have that 'cat food' smell, which is very nice.  I hate getting that cat food smell on my hands!  Blech.  This food is not smelly at all.<br /><br />I like the 3-ounce cans.  I've tried to save some money by getting bigger cans, giving him half and covering and storing the other half for later in the refrigerator, but he doesn't like his food cold (I don't blame him) and it seems to just get wasted.  So, I like the smaller cans.<br /><br />Ultimately, as long as the food is ok for him, the only thing that matters to me is if my kitty will eat it and be happy with it.  And he is.  So, I'll get him this again.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />UPDATE - 15 December 2008<br /><br />We just finished the last can last night and my kitty enjoyed every single one.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie was a little bothersome because it has so much liquid in it.  If I wasn't careful as I opened the can, I would wear some of the juice.  Yes, it's very nice juice, but I still didn't want it on me!  My kitty really liked the juice so it was worth the extra effort to be careful as I opened the can.<br /><br />I will order more of this and cycle it in with his other canned food."
08	20306,B001BDDTB2,A3QS4WWC1LCA6H,12/2/08,0,0,4,Almost worthy of five stars,"I did not hold out much hope for this product. We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites."

Me, kitty Mama? I think it would be cool if they were available as one or the other to the box. Or even singly, but guess that probably wouldn't make sense through Amazon. I like that Petite Cuisine is available in small cans, as she never finishes a 6 oz. meal in a single sitting, but wish there was a little plastic lid the right size to fit when she doesn't even finish 3 oz. Also, for my druthers, it's overkill on the packaging. Lose the inner boxes, just stick the 24 cans in the one outer box. Oh, kudos on no food coloring."

So, I was pretty sure they'd like this up-scale food.<br /><br />Surprisingly, one did not - while she didn't turn up her nose at it, she didn't really want to eat it either.  The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the ""mini"" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess). I also try to purchase items that are US-made, and this is made in Thailand. But, the majority of the cats snarfed it down, so it's deserving of at least 3 stars."

I saw this cat food here and because I care about the cats,I decided to investigate this food because it looked good. With the problems with the cat foods from China recently,I was concerned about the wheat gluten and other foul additives which are not good for the kittens.<br /><br />This company has a really good website where they state that none of those foul additives are in their foods and because of the classy looking website I was relieved enough to get this for my brood.<br /><br />On opening the can,I was surprised and pleased at the look of the food.<br />Bits of carrot and beautiful chunks of white meat chicken in a rich looking gravy. They say it's ""People food for cats"" and it truly looks THAT good. But enough of my palaver, the important judges spoke up in the way that counts most,they concentrated on the new food until the plate was empty followed by contented grooming. The little girl cat is primarily one that picks at her food a few minutes then leaves and comes back later for more eating and on & on,but with this stuff she was parked in front of the dish till everything was consumed. I take that as a good sign"

Nice sized chunks of chicken and vegetables in a lot of gravy.<br /><br />That being said, Ms Casiopia lapped up all the gravy and left the rest.  This however is not the product's fault as she has done this before with other catfoods<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars, but since I won't be purchasing it, I gave it 4.  If your cat will eat chunks and vegetables, this product is for you.<br /><br />I have donated the remainder of the package to a less fortunate friend.<br /><br />Thank you."

I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it ""smokey tea"" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of ""softens"" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!"

I wasn't certain how good it was going to be but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.  The powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste.  I was so impressed that I have signed up for automatic delivery.  It's a great product.

I looked in all the supermarkdets, gourmet stores etc. and could not for the life of me locate any.  I happened by chance to spot it on Amazon and ordered the whole case.  I served it with stuffed salmon and it was a huge hit.  I ended up giving some of the boxes away to friends because they liked it so much.  What makes it different from other couscous is that it is larger grained.  Very good and you can add various ingredients to it to make it even better tasting.  Thanks Amazon!"

I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

I went from a coffee drinker to a green tea drinker because of this tea. It has nice a strong flavor that I simply adore. (I make it much stronger then suggested, I love bitter tastes! Then I just add hot water to the leaves for the second cup, and it is as good as the first!) I have been purchasing this from Stash directly for years, but it is a better deal on Amazon."

McVitie's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJD5LQ"">Hobnobs</a> are already a mite sweeter than many British biscuits and many believe that they already pander a little too much to modern American-influenced tastes ever to truly qualify as a proper biscuit. To add a coating of milk-chocolate (which melts as soon as you try to dunk one) to such a confection is really taking things altogether too far, producing a sickly mismatch of tastes and textures that will appeal only to the young of pallet. Or, perhaps, to the glutton.<br /><br />Perhaps the final clue that this was never intended for a British market is to be found in the fact that McVitie have here dispensed with the modest paper wrapper of a ""proper"" packet of biscuits and chosen to sell these items in a plastic tube.  Hmmm..."

Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey.  My non-GF family & friends said they were ""weird"" and ""different"".  Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another.  I'm sticking with the flourless brownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them."

Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

08	20312,B001BDDTB2,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,12/1/08,0,0,4,Chinese chicken and Chicken pot pie,"All 5 of my cats liked both flavors preferring the Chinese chicken to the very watery pot pie. Although it does not state it is human grade, it certainly appears that it is by sight and smell. Both appeared to have a cornstarch based ""gravy"" with shredded or diced white chicken meat and diced carrots. I took my cats gobbling it down that it was tasty. I was surprised all of them liked both flavors as 2 of my cats are rather finicky. This cat food reminds me of a similar product Whole Foods used to carry in their brand name that I bought on a clearance sale. I alternate buying dry and canned food by Castor & Pollux's (regular and organic), Natural Balance, AvoDern, and By Nature (regular and organic). I feed them regular canned during the week and organic canned food on the weekends. The only issue I have w/ this product is the price point. The brands previously listed range from 5.5 to 6.5 oz. (By Nature-only 12 6.5 cans) and none are watery. They cost the same per can or you could view it as almost half price since the weight is almost double. Since I'm feeding 5 cats approximately 3oz. canned per day and all the dry they can eat at about $2/oz., I try to be as cost effective as possible while only purchasing those high quality products which I also consider this cat food to be. If you read up on pet food in general, you will no longer purchase poor quality food such as Friskies, Iiams, Science Diet, Fancy Feast, etc. If you go to PETCO or Care A-Lot(they carry better brands than PetSmart) and read the ingredient list you will be shocked, appalled, and enlightened. Cats do not well tolerate wheat, corn or soy and NO pet should EVER be fed animal by-products (see pet food at About.com for more information). Since Amazon currently has a [...] coupon off of [...] purchase, I will likely go ahead and purchase the crab flavor and the mixed fish case. Keep in mind you should limit the amount of tuna fed to your cat as well as to your children and any adult (see FDA website for tuna cautions and listed safe fish to eat). I hope in the future Petite Cuisine produces a more cost effective 5-6 ounce can sold in a 24 can case."

If I didn't know it was for cats, I might have tried it because indeed, it looks and smells quite wonderful. The kinds of fish, too, are to my liking. Anytime I go to the sushi restaurant I get yellowfin, snapper, and tuna. However, and this is a big one, my cats have looked at it, tried it, and declined it. They usually eat Fancy Feast - the grilled kind - and I don't understand what in Petite Cuisine would not be to their liking. Maybe it's too healthy. It does have the ingredients one should like: fresh fish, juicy sauce, vitamins...<br />So I have to assume that to any reasonable and average cat, this would be perfectly satisfactory and more than that. I'd give it 5 stars if my cats ate it."

When the humans in the house get a special bit of food, the kitties do also. They are my all day companions and when the humans celebrate so do the cats.  The biggest CON for the product is the cost, which depending upon the specials in force at the time make it about a dollar a can which is 3 oz--filet migion anyone??? But on the PLUS side, the kitties lap up the entire can without the usual bits of this and that left over depending upon how well they like the daily fare. ALSO, both of my cats are male which makes them prone to urinary tract problems. In addition to pure white meat chichen, this has a watery sauce with it which they ""slurp"" right up which adds to their daily fluid intake. After reading many books on cats and kittens, I decided that these male animals needed at least half of their daily fare in ""wet food"" to avoid urinary type probs. This really helps as cats are not noted fluid imbibers unless the fluid is sauce based (or is my lemonade which they make sure to contaminate--UGH!). So I love them and spend a little extra from time to time. The humans in the house make out well too!!!! Best wishes to all and hope this helps. December 2008"

It's great by itself, or you can add things such as corn, jalapenos, sour cream, grated cheddar, chicken, pork, and avocaodo slices.<br /><br />When I eat this soup, I want to have about two cups of it.  There are only 110 calories per cup, but there is a problem.  One cup of this soup has 850 mg of sodium.  That is 36% of the daily value recommneded.<br /><br />Although I love the Southwestern flavor and my family serves chipotle soup to me as a special treat when I am a guest in their home, I find it necessary to warn you about the sodium.  The directions say ""salt and pepper"" to taste, but it already tastes a little too salty.  The ingredients include MSG, a serious souce of sodium.<br /><br />As our doctors tell us, elevated sodium in our diets is one of the causes of high blood pressure."

I keep some of these brownies in the freezer at all times, for serving guests, or for having a little something sweet myself when I come home from an event where everyone but me (all the non-celiacs) have been snarfing down the cake or cookies and I have had . . . coffee.<br /><br />The first time I used this mix, I made the butter recipe, because I had always cooked with butter and was afraid it wouldn't taste good without butter. But the next time, I was in a hurry and didn't want to bother melting butter, so I made the oil version with canola oil, and it tasted just as good. And it's better for you. So that's what I make. I usually add half a cup of Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. The flavor of the dough has a subtle richness that I think comes from being sweetened mostly with mollasses and honey. As with all brownies, don't over cook.<br /><br />I often make this to take to potlucks or other events that require ""something to share,"" because it's easy and quick and everyone who likes chocolate likes these brownies. They are very moist and rich; I cut them into very small squares. Unfortunately, they taste great right out of the freezer; otherwise they would last longer and I would weigh less."

My dry catfood eater could not get to the dish fast enough and he ate every last bite of it which is unusual for him.  My try anything cat also loved the food as well. It was a great treat for them.<br />Upon opening the can of food it smells like fresh fish, almost good enough to eat.<br />Try it, you and your cats will not be disappointed.  You won't have to worry about throwing any unused food away because they will lick the dish clean."

The package says ""people food for cats"" and after reading the ingrediants I believe it is!"

Upon opening the first can of the Sesame Chicken, I was struck by how high the quality looked (the shredded chicken looked as if it had been plucked from the bone), as well as the yummy smell.  I was tempted to heat some up and try it myself!  Resisting that urge, I served it to my cats and they went after it like white on rice, lapping every bit of it up.  And I have some picky cats!<br />The following day, I gave them the Chicken Pot Pie variety; it smelled good, but looked more like chicken soup, with a lot of liquid (and yes, it was somewhat messy).  My cats (except for one) dove into it nonetheless, although they did not wolf it down in one sitting as they did the other flavor.<br />All in all, my cats give the product a big paws-up; however, like another reviewer, I would tend to give this out as a special treat versus daily feeding.  For that purpose, I do recommend this product."

Yes this is expensive but by golly, I think it's real food!  Amazing!  Upon opening the little can, I see flakes of fish & some liquid.  Smells like fish that you eat.  Check the ingredients, hmmm fish.  How about that?  No by products?  Where are the guts they scrap off the floor?  All that yummy stuff not fit for humans to eat...even though a small percentage does end up in our food supply.  The box says ""People Food for Cats""  They weren't kidding!  That's why this is so expensive!  It's FOOD!  Such a novel concept!<br />Do the cats like it?  Oh my yes!  We have 6 cats & they simply LOVE this stuff & why wouldn't they?  This food, it is worth it!  Good food equals healthy cats.  Healthy cats don't go to the vet so darn much.  Less vet visits equal more money!  Yippie!<br />To ease the price burden, each 4 pack box of food contained a coupon for $1.00 off the next 4 pack purchase.

08	2610,B0016FY6H6,A1OAZUFZTEEUEC,10/2/08,9,9,5,great alternative to bottled green tea,"The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is."
08	20320,B001BDDTB2,A3UBDVOL5UDIIB,11/30/08,0,0,5,Very good but expensive,"The main reason I tried the Petite Cuisine cat food is that it does not have by-products.  This food actually smells like good food; there are no bad odors (this is stated on the label blurb but I didn't actually believe it) and my cat loves it.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is the price.  Almost $1 per can for the small 3oz size is pretty steep.  There are other choices out there in canned cat food without by-products for much less.  And choosing the larger 5.5 oz cans in any brand, while not as convenient, will save a lot of money."
08	20321,B001BDDTB2,A2UOHALGF2X77Q,11/30/08,0,0,4,Cats seem to enjoy it.,"It's tough to review cat food, other than to say the cats will eat it. The ingredients seem to be quality, although the cans seem to contain more watery gravy than food. It's not as nasty as most canned cat food though. The cats seem to enjoy it, so I'll give it 4 stars for being ""good""."
08	20322,B001BDDTB2,A37NHGD0WTRYFH,11/30/08,0,0,5,"Good nutrition, cat likes it","I tried to change my review to 4 stars, but I don't seem able to do that.  These are 3 oz cans of 4 different flavors of fish based catfood.  Chicken and rabbit are often more recommended for cats.  The first ingredient is fish broth, making it somewhat high in moisture.  I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food."
08	20323,B001BDDTB2,A25KVM6GJBLISZ,11/30/08,0,0,4,Looks and smells like human food,"What can you say about cat food?  Actually this looks and smells good enough to eat (but I'm not going to try it myself).  So I gave it to all four of our cats when they were not particularly hungry (not at a normal meal time) and they all seemed to enjoy it (even the one that often completely refuses to eat anything but ""crunchies"").<br /><br />Reviewing the label it sounds healthy.  The high taurine content is definitely very healthy for cats.  The only ""fault"" I could imagine is the relatively high price (tiny cans and the fact that it has a high moisture content - the moisture is healthy, but you're paying for water).<br /><br />If you can afford to spoil your cats, give this food a try (be careful your kids don't try to eat it by accident {laugh})."

I make these brownies at least once a week.  I've made them for dessert and no one guesses that they're gluten-free.  We make the ""fudgy"" version and it really is just too good for words.  Nice chocolate chunks, also!<br />Another great value with Amazon's ""subscribe & save"".  This product is approaching $5 per bag at the foodstore.  Now, we can have brownies as much as we want!

It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly."

She's not a particular picky eater, so I can't say much about that. However, she looks to really enjoy this brand of cat food. I have tried some brands of wet food in the past that have made her sick (I know cats seem to have digestive systems that are prone to upsetting!) Petite Cuisine did not have any effect there, and she really enjoyed all the flavors. I don't feed her wet food often, usually just some tuna fish now and then. So, although this food is expensive if you used it at every meal, it is priced about the same as tuna, so it fits my needs perfectly. I'm sure my cat will enjoy the rest of this case, and I can keep the canned tuna to myself for now :-)"

My husband, is SUPER picky about ""health"" foods and though the texture is somewhat different than white, bleached, enriched, yucchhh flour, he and my boy were fighting over the last pieces.

He is definitely a chewer so this helps his teeth, he loves the taste, and it satifies his urge to chew.  As with any product..please know your dog.  If your dog does not chew this product and just gulps it down, then it won't be beneficial to his oral care.  Also, as with ANY product that can be chewed or ingested, please monitor your pet while they are eating/chewing this product.  Overall this is a great product, I will continue to order it for my dog.  This product does not replace routine dental care, but it is part of a dental care routine.  The reason I sound so ""informercial"" is becasue I actually work in the animal care field.  The practice that I used to work for stopped carrying this brand and switched to a cheaper brand. ICK.  I hate it.  So now I just go online to find the real CET chews.  Don't accept a poor substitute.  Especially those cheap ones sold over the counter in places like Walmart or grocery stores.

The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The ""hot chocolate"" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls.

I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find / afford.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this brand.

I cannot tell you how many times I have put food in front of her only to have her walk away. She wants what she wants!! So trying this product I went in with a wary attitude. Alas, she went right for it! So far I have tried three of the flavors and she has liked each one. Being so old I have had trouble finding brands that worked well with her digestive system. I have had no problems with Petite Cuisine so far. Looks like this is a winner in my house. If you have a fussy eater try this one out. You may be pleasantly surprised!"

The vet charges way too much (because everyone needs to make a profit), so I searched the net and found that Amazon carries them for far less.  Even with shipping!  These chews are not rough (as so many bought in the store are), enzymes have been made a part of what the dog chews, and they come in varying thicknesses within each package.  We have three dogs with individual chewing preferences (a retriever's teeth are far different from an Aussie's, in our case) and each bag has plenty for all our dogs.  Highly recommended!"

The fish in these cans has texture, and smells better than other cat food.<br /><br />My two cats absolutely love it.<br /><br />If you want a healthy cat food that is natural and not made in China, give these a try.

I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck"

Man, do they love their friskies: seafood, chicken, or maybe a little turkey (but they don't like beef)...as long as the friskies aren't in that big glop they call ""classic pate.""<br /><br />No 9Lives, no science diet, no canned tuna, no non-friskies brands, thank you very much!  They're cats.  They're picky about what they eat!<br /><br />So I tried this Petite Cuisine, assuming that - just like everything else - they would reject it.  BOY was I wrong!!!!  They literally lapped up the entire plate of the stuff within the first hour after I first put it out.  And it seems to be easy on their digestive system: they don't seem to be barfing it up like they sometimes do when new food comes into the picture.<br /><br />Since it looks like real fish that you or I would eat from a can, I am worried that - just like canned tuna - it's going to cause horribly smelly you-know-whats.<br /><br />I want to check with my vet to see if he thinks it's healthy.  But from the taste point of view, my cats have rated this five meows!"

The eldest guy gets mostly canned food (Wellness and Eagle Pack, plus prescription food mixed in) because he's missing teeth and tends to be a picky eater. Everyone loves this food.<br /><br />I love it too because it looks like real food and smells like real food. The fish isn't stinky at all (I got some wellness shrimp & sardine that about ran me out of the house once, LOL!). There's plenty of liquid to help the old guy eat it, and even my mom's cat who is finicky loves it too.<br /><br />I like the fact that I'm feeding high quality, human grade food to my cats. This is good stuff, and I'm going to look for it locally. Thanks!"

I tried an experiment to see which of the flavors of Petite Cuisine would appeal to tough-guy, and which ms. whiner would like best, and whether or not clingy-dependent had a preference. I think I can state for the scientific record that the appeal of all four flavors of Petite Cuisine transcends even personality-based inclination.<br /><br />The cans may be small, but once you pop the top and tip one into your cat's bowl, you see how much was packed in there. The pieces of fish are large and fresh looking (although I was not tempted to go for the bread and mayo, they smelled good, too). My cats ate every morsel of the food, instead of sucking up the gravy and leaving half the solid to petrify onto the sides of their bowl as they do with other sliced cat foods in sauce.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is pricey, but I think I might keep a carton on hand for occasional special treats. I wouldn't be able to afford it all the time, despite the fact that it's actually worth the price."

I was truly surprised when she showed immediate interest in the snapper variety and then actually ate the whole can.  She was not very fond of the yellowfin--she nibbled a bit and then wanted dry food.  I am thrilled to finally have found something she likes.  She will eat thr tuna, but not with the enthusiasm she has for the snapper. I also like the smaller portion size--no more covering cans and keeping them in the fridge--only to have to warm them up for the next meal.  Definitely try these out."

I am always a bit hesitant, after last years awful pet food poisonings, in trying something new, but all seems well. One thing - open the cans with care.

Are they supposed to be oily and come out bubbly and liquidy? i don't remember them doing that the first time. It's like they separate- baked on the edges and goo in the middle- and it doesn't matter how long they are baked.

It is extremely rich and creamy and so pretty to look at as well.  I was told this could remain in the freezer for up to a year, but the are no preservatives listed that lead me to believe it is really expected to remain in the freezer for a year.  I also find that at 450 calories a slice, I will be serving slices much smaller than the ones suggested by the nutritional data.

But they're cats with no gourmet values. And picky me can't detect an unpleasant odor.  The nutritional values seem comparable to the Wholesome Goodness I've been picking up at WalMart.  Is gluten free an issue for cats?  As far as safety of ingredients, additives, and processing, who knows?  And unless one can be assured of safety, why pay so much more?"

Petite Cuisine Variety pack was here!<br /><br />This product comes in a 3 oz can which is just the right size to split between the two cats. (Of course, my food obsessed male cat could have eaten the whole can himself and then some). Upon opening the can, the food itself looked better than even ""people tuna"" with nice large chunks. The kitties' heads did not move from their bowls until every last morsel was gone. Nigel (foodie cat) kept looking around for more, checking out the kitchen, the table...<br /><br />The kitties certainly enjoyed it, but as their caretaker I also appreciated the ingredients. Fish and fish broth, and NO gluten or by products. Exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because of the price, I would probably consider this more as a treat or a meal supplement than a primary food. The serving suggestion is one can for each 2 1/2 pounds of body weight per day. Let's just say that for my two kitties, and Nigel Cat in particular, this would add up to a LOT of cans of food.<br /><br />However...I definitely plan to keep treating them!"
08	20344,B001BDDTB2,AF3BYMPWKWO8F,11/24/08,91,98,3,Please check the controversial ingredients and decide for yourself,"While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one."

08	44409,B0018OMTOM,A2PW5XDAP9247R,5/31/08,1,3,1,Deadly treat,I bought these at a local store. I broke up the first one for smaller training treats. My finger was stabbed by a needle shaped fish bone. This bone could have easily perforated my dogs digestive tract and made him very ill or dead. I have contacted the manufacturer and have yet to receive a response.
08	20345,B001BDDTB2,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,11/24/08,19,20,5,Looks like a winner,"I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it's a minor consideration.  While it's never said that the ingredients are ""human grade"" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as ""Product of Thailand"" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It's also listed as ""dolphin safe.""  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that's the important thing.  He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to.  I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat."

What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.  A case of seafood dinners-Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, & Tuna & Shrimp.  I was sleeping when my person stood with my treat dish poised above my nose.  ""Don't bug me"" I thought as I sleepily eyed what she had in hand....A TREAT!<br /><br />I quickly followed into the kitchen to partake of a delicious entree of Red Snapper.  This totally looks like peoplefood!  I scarfed down a half a can immediately and if there was a pattern at the bottom of my bowl I would have licked that off as well.  That was one clean dish.  I've been told that tomorrow we'll try maybe Yellowfin, which sounds equally good.<br /><br />Likes:  looks like peoplefood, smells good, not overly fishy, and they add vitamins and no wheat gluten....hm, not sure about that one, but apparently wheat gluten isn't good.  Anyway....it is delicious and it is much like my other favorite, ""Sheba"".<br />Dislikes: My people wouldn't just leave me the whole can because they don't think I'll stop eating, but that's really more of a personal issue.<br /><br />Four paws up on this one!"

Both he and our 7 month old lab puppy (who are both on a healthy diet that includes Nutro Ultra and Evo dog foods, a daily multivitamin, vitamin C and Joint Support from Trader Joe's) are given these to keep their teeth healthy.  They love them, the chips are large and easy to chew and digest and are completely non-toxic unlike many other conventional products on the market that claim to function the same way.  Buying them online means I get them very economically and they are shipped immediately - I sometimes get them the very next day without paying any rush charge.  I would suggest asking your Vet before trying them, just to be sure they are safe for your particular companion animal."

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

08	20349,B001BDDTB2,A3A6GXILVT9JNW,12/11/08,6,6,4,Caution - may cause kitty stampede,"I called upon a panel of two expert feline food testers assist me with this review.  The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings."

Of course my cats loved it and each devoured a whole can. I felt it was quite overpriced for tuna and will not purchase again. I think it's much more cost-effective to buy a can of Phillip's crab meat from the grocery store so my cats and I can both enjoy it."

I rate 4 out of 5 stars because the canned food is too low in protein and fats to use the main pet diet.  I recommend this product with the caveat that you supplement it with additional protein and fats (a dry food would be good)."
08	20353,B001BDDTB2,A3VSMUBKY8HYB2,11/25/08,4,4,3,"Quality ingredients; unfortunately, not a hit with my cat","The first test for a new canned cat food is the ingredient list.  The ingredients in Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (chicken flavors) passed this test with flying colors: Chicken, Chicken Broth, Carrots are listed first and there is no wheat gluten. Unfortntately, the 2nd test is whether my cat will eat the food and this ended up with a big thumbs down. Not sure if it was the significant amount of broth in a serving or the fact that it is chicken (he usually has fish-based canned food), but after a 1st bite, he just walked away.<br /><br />If a cat is accustomed to eating chicken canned food, I would still recommend giving this a try because of the quality ingredients."

I needn't have worried; my cats love it!<br /><br />I like that it has human grade ingredients (no bad odors here) and that it contains absolutely no gluten (the ingredient that caused a massive pet food recall a few years back).  Something I didn't know before ordering Petite Cuisine is that it comes in recyclable aluminum cans, which means it won't contribute to the overflowing landfill problem.<br /><br />All in all, my only complaint is the cost, but I will probably buy more for my cats as a special treat.  They will love me for it."

08	20355,B001BDDTB2,A3VZH0PWLQ9BB1,11/24/08,0,0,5,"Great assortment, aroma, cats love it.",My cats love it. They eat most cat foods once they are used to them but switching them to new foods can be tricky. It was no problem with them. They loved the food. Even the cat who never eats canned food dug in. The food is very tasty looking and has a great aroma. Good stuff!!
08	20356,B001BDDTB2,A3DA0BTIGT3WG5,11/24/08,0,0,5,MMMEEEEEEOOOOWWWW!!,"Let me start here by admitting that we have 5 cats that live with us now (I know, don't even ask it's a loooong story).  I've always been a big fan of the Fancy Feast and recently the fishier varieties of the Aristocats soft foods.  On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.<br /><br />Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this brand up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.<br /><br />This brand looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable brands.  All in all my kitties really enjoyed this food & I will certainly be back for more."
08	47692,B001ELL9SQ,A31P2AXXQKTLHN,2/26/08,2,2,4,cooking fanatic,"The boxes are smaller than I expected. They look really cute on the counter. I also bought the butchers salt and the gardeners salt. It is too bad that they do not package them together as a trio. I have two houses so it was not  a big deal for me to have two of each. They were not packed very well when shipped and arrived somewhat damaged, I had to glue two of the boxes back together.The salt is of medium coarseness, the salt to herb ratio is 3/4 to 1/4 respectably. It's not a great deal initially but the boxes are reusable and it is quite easy to make more using the ingredient list on the side of each box!"
08	20357,B001BDDTB2,AAPPWNP9FWVWS,11/29/08,3,5,3,This is not Fancy Feast,"Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.<br />6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat."
08	20358,B001BDDTB2,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,11/28/08,3,5,1,#1 Ingredient is Mostly Water,"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a ""fair shake"", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a ""bad batch"" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat ""favorites"" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into ""fish broth"", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on ""fish water"" doesn't sound like a good deal to me."
08	20364,B001BDDTB2,AK8LOFYRZJJW0,12/17/08,1,2,4,Seems to give our cat more energy.,"I have a huge, overweight cat that I adopted from the pound.  He doesn't eat that much, but he doesn't move much either, which I think causes his weight problem. He normally eats an expensive dry cat food recommended by his vet. When I chose Petite Cuisine, I was a little concerned that it would add to his weight problem, but it seems the opposite has happened.  Within a week, he seemed  to have more energy and has been up playing and chasing invisible mice around the house.  We've never seen him move this much in the two years that we've had him.  I don't know if his diet was missing something that this cat food contains, or if it's just coincidence.  I haven't weighed him, but he seems a little lighter, and he sure acts like he feels better.  We're feeding him half a can a day in addition to his dry cat food.<br /><br />The only downside to the fish flavors is that I notice that the smell hangs in the house, even if I scrub up everything after he eats."

When I asked about it, her husband conducted a taste test with regular table salt used in the US and Fleur de Sel from Guerande.  The table salt tastes bitter and over powering compared to the lovely mild flavor of this hand harvested sea salt.  So when I got home, I ordered myself some.  There is a huge difference in the flavor of foods I'm cooking now!"

Very happy with this flavor.

I am a huge pink grapefruit lover and I really didn't expect a lot when I decided to buy these and give them a try...THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!<br /><br />They look like a grapefruit section, and they are coated with sugar. These are delicious and would go great at any party or just to have as a little treat!<br /><br />Other people have said that they are good in small doses, but I wouldn't want more than 5-6 pieces at a time anyway, or else I would weigh 600 pounds! These are perfect to have around for a little treat for the kids or friends. I will definitely purchase these again!"

We decided to get some of this coffee to start out our home grinding experience. Yesterday morning, the mailman arrived with our package. We have brewed 4 pots so far.<br /><br />First, no complaints about the caffeine. You can get quite a buzz on a couple of cups. And the beans are beautiful.<br /><br />It is not bitter or acidic - it's nice & smooth. I was disappointed with the the almost total lack of the wonderful aroma noted by other reviewers, though. It just seems to lack any outstanding flavor or character. Tastes similar to many better grocery store blends I have used in the past. Although my wife liked it better than I did, when asked if she would buy it again - she said: ""Probably not.""<br /><br />I'm not encouraged to try any of their other blends based on this experience. We will probably stick with Howe's, which is sold at our grocer. At least you can smell it before buying.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were just too high."

He LOVES canned cat food usually, but is 13 1/2 years old and rather finicky now.  He likes just about any kind of Fancy Feast, though once in a while, being a cat, he will turn up his nose even at that.<br />But I couldn't get him to do more than lick some of the gravy off the first serving I gave him of these chicken-flavored items. Subsequent offerings were met with the floor-scratching response (cat owners usually know this, but the cat is using the same gesture he uses in the litter box, effectively saying ""This stuff is c***!"").<br />My friends who have cats don't give them canned food - so I have most of this stuff left in my basement awaiting a hungry, interested feline consumer.<br />The product is made in Thailand, which is too close to China for my comfort, anyway.  We all know about recent deaths and problems with Chinese-made pet food (and baby formula!) ingredients.  I considered not using this product at ALL once I noticed it was from Thailand.<br />But Buster made the call, so I didn't have to."

08	20381,B001BDDTB2,AT96TYI24GKXH,12/16/08,0,1,2,Mostly Just Sauce,"The variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food. Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out. it seems to be little square bite size (for cats) pieces of a chicken-like item, in a broth, mostly broth. Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the ""soup"" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it). And frankly, even with the manufacturer's recommendation of what would amount to 6 or more cans a day for my larger 12 lb cat, just not enough food there to satisfy him, mostly liquid.<br /><br />Chinese Chicken: Once again, fairly saucy, but with a much higher meat:sauce ratio, with what looked like a fair amount of shredded chicken. Once again, my picky eater just lapped up the sauce, and my other big guy, who eats anything, really was not interested, no matter how hungry he was.<br /><br />And please tell me why there are little tiny chunks of carrots in each of these? Cats have no interest in carrots, do they have some need for Vit A that is not fulfilled in the supplementation of this food? I doubt it, that is in there for us humans... stupid.<br />I gave this two stars instead of one, because one of my cats quite liked the sauce."

This is the perfect product to buy if you're not able to get traditional Turkish coffee ground with cardamom, but have to settle with a generic roast.  It's sweet, yet spicy (think gingerbread), and reminds me of my travels in the Middle East. The only problem was that it arrived with a broken lid."
08	20382,B001BDDTB2,A105S56ODHGJEK,12/16/08,0,1,2,Good... If your cat will actually eat it.,"I have to admit, it's nice that Petite Cuisine doesn't have the standard nasty canned cat food smell to it. It actually looks and smells decent, compared to the stuff I'm used to. It also has an overall healthier list of ingredients than most canned cat foods. Normally, that would add up to a five-star meal. The problem is, our cat won't eat the stuff! Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff! Overall a disappointing experience on this end, but it's worth a try because every cat is different. You may find that it suites your cat's tastes just fine."

We ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened. Outstandingly delicious but I cannot imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you cannot avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available. What a mess. If these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2.

One cat is part Maine Coon and weighs about 28lbs, one is 17-years with a thyroid condition and constantly wants to eat, the third is the Coon's twin and she is a bit of a glutton.  ANyway, each of these cans has about the equivalent of two tablespoons of food and the rest is all liquid.  That was a reall turnoff for my guys.  The actual protein content LOOKS good, but they all three pretty much turned their noses up at it.  I have been using it as my ""emergency supply"" but have to say, I would never buy."

But if you're really drunk, no mint on earth can hide that fact.<br /><br />Since I find Altoids to be generally strong, almost too strong, I ultimately chose the Spearment flavor, as it actually tasts okay and leaves the breath smelling fresh but not overpowering."

(I'll try to post a video review also.) However, this assortment has tuna in two-thirds of the flavors. From research online, it seems doubtful that it's good for cats to eat much tuna -- so these are better for occasional treats than for a steady diet. One site even warns that cats can get addicted to the taste of tuna (even though it's not healthy for them) and refuse other food.<br /><br />To cap it all off, tonight my roommate didn't realize it was cat food, and split a can of Petite Cuisine Snapper as part of tonight's dinner for the two of us. On the plate it looked like a little side dish, and I figured it was some kind of leftover. For what it's worth, it tasted fine. However, we plan to feed the rest of the samples to the cat."

When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites."

About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of ""juice"", which I find my cats tend to enjoy.

(I'm wary of food imports from Third World countries in general now.) Then I saw ""People food for cats"" and ""No gluten"" on the outside and figured I'd at least open a can or two to see how the food played with the target audience. We have three cats, two of whom have health problems and are sometimes picky about what they'll eat. From the first can, they have all scarfed this up--even the one with digestive problems who would generally prefer dry food and sometimes needs coaxing to eat. I've never seen her gobble canned food with such gusto, finishing everything down to the last shred and then checking out the others' bowls for remaining scraps (in vain because they like it as much as she does). The food looks like canned fish for humans in sauce--no prefab ""morsels."" The flavor with shrimp actually has little whole shrimp along with the fish chunks. My only concern now is that they'll dig in their heels when I go back to feeding them the more conventional food that's still filling the cupboard."

It seemed overly expensive to me - at first.  the cans are pretty and are only three ounces.  At first, again, that didn't seem like much to me.  But, my preconceived notions went out the window when I saw how my cats loved it.  The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.  I'm ashamed that I'd never given this to them before and, despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans, I think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given."

Part of that change was finding a sweentner which would not interfere with blood glucose levels much, and tasted good.  I went to a health food store, and this product was recommended.  I finally tried it on some plain cereal.  I expected something like the flavor of Splenda, or maybe Equal.  At first, it was sweet like sugar and it was noticable, but it did have an aftertaste.  It was like the old articifial sweeteners.  I tried using less another time, but the result was the same.  I sweetened some tea with it, and that wasn't bad.  So, overall, it takes some getting used to.  It's not bad for being healthier than regular sugar but don't expect to be ""wowed."""

I bought a 5lb bag at the vet's office for $32.00 of Hill's Prescription K/D dry dog food.  The vet told me that there were different brands and I'd have to experiment to find out which one my dog would like.  Not knowing that I would need a prescription for such dog food I went home without a prescription.<br /><br />My dog seemed to like the food - so knowing that a 5lb bag wouldn't last long I went in search of this special dog food. I went from store to store trying to find the k/d diet dog food.  I quickly found out I would need a prescription - of which the vet had to mail to me.  Even with the prescription you can only buy this special dog food from a vet's office.  Well for me - that's totally inconvenient.  My vet's office is a 1/2 hour drive away and with my work schedule and kids - it's not always convenient to drive for an hour just to get dog food.<br /><br />At one store I found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet food which could be bought without a prescription.  The clerk there was exetremely knowledgable and helpful.  She told me that the Hi-Tor Neo Dog food was actually better than the Hill's Prescription k/d.  I thought I  would try it since the 10lb bag was $24.99.  My dog loved it!  The clerk told me that they might not carry this brand for much longer so I went on the internet and found that Amazon carries this product. Even with shipping I'll be saving more than half of what I would spend at the vet's for a 10lb bag - not to mention the cost of gas and my time for a round trip.  I compared the labels and I do believe that Hi-Tor is actually better than the prescription brand.  In short, it's better for my dog, my dog likes it, I don't need a prescription and it's half the price with more convenience than the other dog food - what's not to love about it?"

08	52907,B001DBODMG,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,9/19/08,3,5,5,Yum!,"First, a confession.  When I cook or eat, I try to use as little salt as possible.<br /><br />Second, though, there are times when salt is an important part of the preparation of food or when it makes sense to add once a meal is cooked.<br /><br />And I far prefer these products, in which you have salt crystals and a built in grinder. I think the end result is preferable to the standard salt out of a box. To me, there is a tastier edge once the ground salt enters the recipe or once the salt hits the cooked food (although it might just be my imagination, too)!<br /><br />Anyhow, this is one nice choice out of the many salt grinders available at the grocery store and I have long been satisfied with it."

The beans are too oily for my machine and it has trouble grinding them.  I have used this machine for several years, and this is the only coffee that it had a problem with and I have used it with other flavored coffees.  Again, I probably would have given it a higher rating if not for this factor which is highly personal to my situation."
08	44424,B000LDQWHG,A2BW5OZN1XXSKU,4/6/08,2,2,5,great,My puppy loves these.  Too bad she devours them so fast but she enjoys doing it.  Wish the holes were standardized.  Some don't fit the toy.
08	40437,B001ELL3D2,A27TVBD5GVDHD8,7/28/08,1,1,5,Great Coffee,We've been drinking this coffee for several months and love the flavor and the fact that it's organic. Buying 3 bags at a time is no problem as we throw the extras in the freezer till it's time to open a fresh bag. We purchased some other whole bean organic coffees elsewhere on the Internet at much higher prices and the shipping was quite expensive. Amazon sells this at a great price and it qualifies for free shipping making it cheaper than buying the typical run of the mill coffee from the grocery store. Try it and see for yourself.

Nothing different from regular catnip. Actually I had another brand that produced crazier reactions like drooling and hyperactivity. Can't remember the brand tho.<br /><br />And I smelled the stuff and it seemed stale, the date on the back said copyright 2004! This is 2008! Maybe if you get a fresher batch it will be craziness all around."

Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. That's $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I don't get it.
08	20388,B001BDDTB2,A2NMQWBDWT3SQF,11/26/08,0,1,4,Looks almost like people food!,"My family has two cats who are just over a year old.  We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor- little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.<br /><br /> I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge."

I think it helps to keep them busy and out of trouble while I'm away.<br /><br />My only gripe is that they're made in China, and I really have a hard time feeding my dogs something made in China (remember the pet food recall, lead paint in toys, milk debacle, etc..).  Hopefully I can figure out a recipe to copy these things because they do work well."
08	8039,B001E6K67Q,A27CKOACMX8O5F,5/20/08,2,3,1,Bad product,Sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. She said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. So I would not reccomend this product.

Then for Christmas 2007 I ordered a package of three tins, I love it so much! The tea flavor is not overpowered by the bergamot essence that makes this Earl Grey, yet it's a gentle tea, not overly tannic.  I'm a daily tea drinker and this is my favorite."
08	52932,B0007A8XV6,A37OEAOYVLKYC,10/3/08,0,1,4,Great product,"All the david rio chai's are good.  This one has great flavor for being decaf and sugar-free.  Contains palm oil which is high in saturated fat so not something to consume daily.<br /><br />The book of chai, don't know if they still sell it, is a very nice holiday present that has a variety of chai in single serving packages."

I have to admit the fresh ground is better, but Yuban makes a really good ground coffee.  Don't waste your money on Folger's or Maxwell House, this is the best ground coffee out there."
08	5607,B000G1X45G,A2HYIX71V7SPBN,12/13/08,0,0,5,Delighted Consumer,We just love Yuban coffee and there is not a store where we live that has Yuban for sale.  I was delighted to discover that I could order it at Amazon.com by the case and always keep it in our pantry.  The only thing that could be any better would be that I could get Yuban beans so I could grind it myself as I make a pot of coffee.
08	5608,B000G1X45G,APJK2KFKK25LE,11/15/08,0,0,5,You can't beat Yuban,Yuban has been my coffee of choice for 20 years. The price at Amazon is very good. I recommend this product for any coffee lover.
08	14816,B000Y8UUE4,AXLYTEFUXEAJN,6/6/08,1,1,5,You'll be Queen (or King) of the Barbeque,"Although I'm not particular fond of figs, I bought this sauce/marinade on the advice of a total stranger I met at a Long Island, NY winery. He told me how unbelievable it was on steak, and, boy, was he right!  I've used it on steak as a dipping sauce and I've barbequed with it.  I've used it on pork and chicken and have had it accidentally soak up into my side dish on my plate,such as rice and vegetables.  I don't care what you use it on, it's absolutely the most delicious concoction I've ever used on everything (although, I must admit, I haven't tried it on ice cream or cake! Just joking!)  I'm so hooked, I plan to buy a case of it."
08	27675,B001EO69NS,A1L4RDILGM7D9E,7/29/08,28,31,5,Delicious yogurt!,"This starter makes delicious yogurt. I like to use it with whole milk. You must first heat the milk up to at least 180 degrees and then cool it to 73-77 degrees. As the previous reviewer stated, you must use an icewater bath to cool the milk down. This works wonderfully. I let my yogurt incubate 15 hours and it is extremely thick and delicious! It has a bit of a tart taste, which is very yummy. I alternate using this yogurt with the Yogourmet freeze-dried yogurt for variety. I eat yogurt every single day and have been using Yogourmet starters for a couple of years now. I won't use any other brand as I've tried several and the ones from Yogourmet are the best."
08	19248,B001E5E20O,A29VG90T649CSU,1/31/08,0,0,5,Simply the Best!,"This is the most delicious Earl Grey tea I have ever tasted. The aroma is wonderful, and the amount of bergamot in this blend is perfect. I use about one and one half tablespoons in my 17 ounce tea press and steep for 4 minutes. You can use less or more tea, to taste. I love the fact that I can re-steep the same tea leaves a second time, and enjoy another pot of tea that is as delicious as the first. If you are already an Earl Grey fan, I promise you will not be disappointed. If you have never tried Earl Grey, why not start at the top? Enjoy!"
08	27673,B001EO69NS,A3475YO8NTGM3A,7/28/08,44,45,5,Best yogurt ever,"Yogurt made with this starter and organic whole milk is simply the best I have ever tasted. It does not have the thin, sour taste that most of the single-culture starters produce. The taste is instead smooth and full-bodied. It is also thicker than most when a little dry milk is added. The process takes a bit longer, since the milk must be heated to 180 degrees, then cooled to 75. The cooling requires an ice-water bath, or the temperature would never get that low in our kitchen. After 12 hours in the Yogourmet Multi, which starts at room temperature and very gradually increases to 112 degrees, the yogurt is perfect every time. It is so good that it makes a good dessert all by itself, and is even better mixed with fruit. Combined with mayonnaise, it makes a fine potato or carrot-raisin salad. Smoothies are really smooth. Give it a try in your favorite recipe. You will love it!"

My two cats are so picky and I can never really tell what they will eat.  They loved the first can of this and I thought, well, we will see what happens in a coupld days.  They go through food like Sherman through Atlanta and even though I have only had the food for a couple of days, they have eaten six cans!  Little piglets.  I love this food.  The consistency is nice and juicey and my cats appreciate that.  If you are looking for a good quality, tasty food, order this."

I'm one of three furry beings that share a dwelling with our friend Two Legs, and the food that is usually served is gross. Fancy Feast! Ugh. I refuse. Poached salmon I grudgingly nibble on because of the omega oil (makes my fur shiny). I do like sirloin steak when it is cooked precisely medium rare...but wait!<br /><br />Two Legs is opening up something new!<br />It smells wonderful. Enticing.<br />Looks good too.<br />WOW. What a flavor.<br />Tuna and Shrimp. Tuna and Sole! Yellowfin! And the Snapper is the cat's pajamas.<br />I'm in heaven.<br />Thank you Two Legs. From now on, only buy Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (the Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie is delectable too)."
08	20391,B001BDDTB2,A26DCH8BNG0BTO,11/25/08,0,1,5,Our cats love these Petite Cuisine meals,"I love the smaller size of these cans so the cats can eat them in one sitting, and the quality seems very high.  The cats both love them, and they are know to be picky eaters.  My husband commented they looked like 'people food' :) I think this is a very good product and I would buy it again."

They both liked this soft food and didn't have any issues with it. Sometimes they've not liked some of the soft food and cat vomit is not fun to clean up.<br /><br />The cats heard me opening up the food and would bolt into the kitchen and lick their bowls clean. That is a five claw rating."
08	20393,B001BDDTB2,A2DB720I9XRX7K,11/24/08,0,1,5,A Winner!,"Well, the other reviewer are correct; this is a very fine cat food. Yes, it looks and smells tasty--flakey chunks in gravy. Probably tastes as good as human food (and just as expensive, but I presume it is formulated for cats). I like the way it is packaged and the small servings are just right. I actually divide it in half for my two cats, because I free-feed them kibble. They snarf it down!"
08	20394,B001BDDTB2,A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,12/13/08,1,3,5,My cats love it...,"Our cats love soft cat food, so I was not surprised when they quickly devoured Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />One of our cats is allergic to corn products, so I was pleased to discover that Petite Cuisine doesn't contain corn or corn products.  It's also free of wheat gluten.  Vitamin supplements are added into the food - Vitamins E, A, and D3.  Our cats have digested it without any noticeable problems.<br /><br />The 24-can pack contains six cans each of ""Red Snapper Entree,"" ""Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree,"" ""Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entree,"" and ""Yellow Fin Tuna Entree.""  Our cats especially love the Yellow Fin Tuna, and they eat every last morsel.  Some pieces get left behind with the Red Snapper and the Tuna and Shrimp flavors, however, maybe because the fish pieces are larger (I suppose I could mash it up for them, though.)  The product's packaging promises ""no bad odors,"" and they're really not that bad -- unless you can't stand the smell of fish.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine seems to be kind of spendy; it costs about twice what you'd pay for a can of Friskies, and the cans of Petite Cuisine are smaller.  After giving my cats Petite Cuisine, I went to the grocery store to look at similar cat food products, and discovered there are several very similar items (to P.C.) on the market, and for a lot cheaper.<br /><br />So yes, there are cheaper options.  But in terms of taste and kitty appreciation, this was a hit."

They eat dry food daily and then once in awhile they get the moist food as a special treat.<br /><br />In opening the can, there was not the overwhelming ucky fishy smell that most moist cat foods have.  And it looked like people food too!  I portioned out on one plate 3 equal helpings and called in the calvary!<br /><br />As they licked, the plate rotated on the floor ...ha ha!!... and so did they!!  They followed their portion around like it was the last thing they were ever gonna get to eat!<br /><br />The response ... a resounding purrrrr and then paw-licking/face cleaning!  They loved it!  And that was just the  Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree!!<br /><br />Each day after they got a new flavor, Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, and Steamed Tuna and Shrimp ... responses were all the same! 2 paws straight up from my kitties!!<br /><br />Highly recommended for humans owned by cats everywhere!!<br />- 1smileycat :-)"

You can also skip the soup<br />base and add your own stuff. I like adding tofu and tempura fish balls with my udon. If you're fortunate enough to have a 99 Ranch Market or Nijiya Market nearby, save yourself some money and buy the udon there since they're sold for only 79 cents a pack."

For some people these may taste a little too strong, perhaps; but I enjoy them very much.<br /><br />Altoid mints are very low in calories, fat, sodium and more. The main effect, therefore, is simply to make your breath its very freshest. They come in that famous little tin that keeps them fresh until their expiration date.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Altoids as THE ultimate in breath mints. People who also simply love that strong spearmint taste will delight in these, too.<br /><br />Great job, Altoids!"
08	20396,B001BDDTB2,A1ZKGSDVP057L9,12/6/08,1,3,3,Reminds Me of Garden Medley,"This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal."
08	20397,B001BDDTB2,A1BTG38XSGYLW3,12/1/08,1,3,4,50/50 response from family cats,"The quality of this cat food is excellent, with fish broth and the named fish (tuna, red snapper, sole, shrimp, or yellowfin) listed as the first (i.e., primary) ingredients.  It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.  If your cat generally likes fish flavors and you are looking for a high quality, healthy cat food, I would certainly recommend trying Petite Cuisine."

Is it still a bargain?<br /><br />Now we've passed the $50 mark, which comes out to $5.57 per pound. I pay $5-6 per pound for fresh-roasted beans in five-pound lots.<br /><br />If the rating were just for the price, I would make it three stars."
08	8037,B001E6K67Q,A1CHSF2YTBXUAS,7/17/08,2,2,4,Very Good and Relatively Inexpensive,"I made this last night for dinner. It was very good. I substituted the cheese topping they provide with real cheese and then used the casserole as burrito filling. It made 14 burritos (8 inch), so it goes a long way.<br /><br />If you like spicy stuff it is a little bland but that is expected with boxed meals. On the other hand, if you don't like spicy, then it is a little hot...so that could go either way.<br /><br />As a side note--there isn't much meat in this so if you are wanting lots of hamburger, you would be better off with something else."

I love having the ability to know exactly how much creamer I'm using by counting the individual packets. (This product isn't available in my grocery store-- just by the coffee dispensers at local convenience stores.) They're perfect for keeping at my desk at work~~I don't have to use the community fridge, and it doesn't lump up in my coffee like the powdered versions do. It's a little less convenient at home, though, where I'm accustomed to using my refrigerated bottled versions~~opening the little packets one at a time at 5 am can get annoying--but then again, I know exactly how much creamer I'm adding to my coffee instead of dolloping in a random splash. (Now all I need is someone to add the sugar-free versions of Coffee-Mate to the Amazon selection. Hint, hint. :) )"

It beats half and half hands down for making coffee delicious..... and I drink more coffee than the average person.....BUT....> I have this problem called CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) and suffer from Atherosclerosis (fat build-up in my arteries) THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS TRANS-FATS. Do not let the labeling fool you. The serving size is listed as ONE tablespoon, and there is less than 1 gram of trans fat per 1 tablespoon serving (there is actually about 1/2 gram per serving).... BUT THEY LIST IT AS 0 GRAMS. BUT NOBODY USES JUST ONE TABLESPOON!! I use FOUR to FIVE tablespoons per serving, as does my wife. TRANS FAT will coat your arteries no matter how healthy you are.. it accumulates in your blood vessels and slowly reduces the oxygen delivery to your body, especially your HEART....slow strangulation.

These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included an equal number of each flavor) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the chunks of seafood. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e: fish broth, Tuna filets, Red Snapper Fillets, soy bean oil, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Carrageenan, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 13%, crude fat (min) 1.5%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%, taurine (min) 0.1%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on all four flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended."

08	20399,B001BDDTB2,A35B701Z30TKJC,11/9/08,1,3,1,My cat tried to bury this food.,My cat and my neighbor's cats would not eat this food. I wound up giving the case to the cat rescue organization.
08	20400,B001BDDTB2,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,11/28/08,4,8,1,Cat Goes On Hunger Strike,"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it."
08	81588,B001EQ4RBM,A1VEOWIH3D0PTZ,5/22/08,1,1,5,Great taste,Love the taste not to hot but a little tangy.  Price is good and really good service.

08	10807,B001E4Q5WI,ANIL9E19D35LV,5/18/08,5,6,5,A Family Favorite,"Although I'm a little embarrassed touting something so processed (maybe it's a reaction to a childhood eating peanut butter my parents hand-ground at their local health food store) I have to say I really like this stuff.  It is also the only peanut butter my 10 year old daughter will eat (can't get any other brands past her).  The reduced fat aspect of it may not save calories but it gives the product a slightly sweet taste, and for some reason only the Skippy brand maintains its smooth texture--every other brand I've tried gets tough or grainy patches in it.  This product is getting harder to find in supermarkets (and when I do find it it's at a premium price), so the availability on Amazon is great."
08	47710,B00168Q338,A1FFP0ORCC7YH9,11/9/08,1,1,5,Aloha Island Coffee,They make the best coffee.  My husband and I drink Kona coffee daily and this is the absolute best.  I love the pods because you don't have to waste a whole pot of coffee and we can each have the coffee the way we like it.  My husband especially likes the Diamond Reserve.
08	81587,B001EQ4RBM,AGLRS0Q4QA1WA,8/24/08,1,1,5,GREAT for low carb/glycemic diets,"This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.  My whole office is now eating my ""diet food.""  If the sodium is high for your diet, mix them 50:50 with plain unsalted almonds. just YUMMY!"

08	57138,B001E6IZVU,A15FAQCMGWGL60,7/13/08,3,6,1,outrageous prices,Why would anyone purchase a box of cereal for $4-6$ or more. It is much cheaper at your local store. This site should feel embarrassed of the prices.
08	20403,B001BDDTB2,AKCCXEWXJ0VIW,12/12/08,0,2,5,My Cat Liked It,"Well, he's a cat. I opened the can, spooned it down on his dish, and he ate it. Not all in one sitting, but he did gobble. Bear in mind though that this cat denuded a mouse and has gnawed on baby rabbits, so he will eat things that don't smell like seafood and are not on an attractive ceramic plate.<br /><br />I suppose the true taste test would be to partake of it myself, but Amazon Vine, I'm not willing to go there, even for you.<br /><br />The cans are on the smaller side, the smell was not overpowering. The product is made in Thailand, if that information would help you decide whether to purchase.<br /><br />Personally, I'm sticking to Red Lobster for my seafood. But I can't take my cat there."
08	50390,B000FKIYEO,AQ3CTPAMAF3IJ,7/2/08,3,3,5,The Where's Waldo of Mints,"Thank god for the internet, as I have only seen these mints in one store while visiting Florida. Locally (Philly) I have yet to see these in any store, and believe me I've looked everywhere.<br /><br />These are a great alternative to the overly powerful Peppermints, and the ""Tastes too much like Big Red gum"" cinnamon mints. These are strong, but you don't get the burning tongue sensation with the urge to spit it out. Of all the Altoid flavors, this is most enjoyable of the lot.<br /><br />If you like spearmints but never had the chance to try these, I couldn't recommend them more. These are now my mints of choice over Polo Mints and another of my favorites, Foxes Mints. Now if we could just get stores to carry these maybe more people would learn how truly excellent they taste."
08	25733,B0015R9BQG,A3T6GMR57Z4NXG,3/7/08,1,1,5,A Very Satisfying Snack,"I love Primal Spirit Jerky.  I've tried several different flavors and some appealed more than others but, as a previous reviewer noted, that was more personal taste than because of any deficiency in product.  This is a very tasty snack that you can really sink your teeth into.  My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and breakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat-alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.  Definitely going to order some of these now...Yum!"
08	25732,B0015R9BQG,AXQIHSF9KK7CO,6/10/08,1,1,5,Vegetarian Staple,"This product is a must have because it is a way for vegetarians to be able to have protein while on the go, and also for anyone whose physician has recommended additional protein intake, especially throughout the day.  The convenience is great and the flavor of this product is super.  I really enjoy it."
08	25731,B0015R9BQG,ASP4CRYVPOSBG,7/31/08,1,1,5,They are totally awesome!,"I've eaten these for a long time, and they are totally awesome, though not always easy to get hold of (they run out).  Great protein source for a busy vegan like me, plus I am a fitness trainer and workout a lot, so I need the convenient protein. Personally I think mesquite lime is the best, flavor wise, of all the Primal Strips, but they are all good.  My hubby loves the barbecue ones."
08	84636,B000FK63IS,A1AFY3MTFLAQR3,10/25/08,1,1,5,Yummy,"My husband got us this since we are avid eaters of brown rice. We love it. The secret is that it is closer to whole wheat pasta, and it does not stick together to form a big noodle bundle! If you are into wheat-free stuff, this is just for you."
08	84637,B000FK63IS,A360OR7C1KF7YP,3/1/08,1,1,5,Just like regular spaghetti.,"My husband, who doesn't have to eat gluten-free, loves this spaghetti. Other than an awesome flavor and texture, it reheats very well, allowing leftovers to save money."
08	10809,B001E4Q5WI,AAB5HFYJ0C17W,6/29/08,3,4,5,peanutty-licious,"This is my favorite pb.  It is really full of peanut taste, and I feel that it is reduced fat because there is less oil added."
08	20404,B001BDDTB2,A15XY6GGKD3B6D,12/3/08,0,2,5,My Cat Loves It,"Granted, my cat does not have the most discriminating taste (I've seen him happily munching on lizards and cockroaches), but I can tell he really likes this food. He usually breezes by whenever he feels like it to eat the dry food I leave in his bowl. Since I have been giving him Petite Cuisine, he is ready and waiting by his bowl at meal time. I have to push his head out of the way so that I can finish emptying the can into his dish.<br /><br />Most canned cat foods look like fishy hummus or strange, extruded rubbery strips, but this food looks just like what you get when you open a can of tuna, except with more sauce. The shrimp flavor has tiny recognizable shrimp in it.<br /><br />Full Crazy Cat Lady Disclosure: Before I would let my babies eat a new cat food, I did a little (ok, hours) of due diligence research on Petite Cuisine. After the Chinese pet food debacle, I wasn't about to let them eat food produced by an unknown foreign entity. According to what I could find on the internet, PetPlay Inc. is a relatively new American startup by CEO Eric Weber. He has years of experience with the premium cat food market; was part of the team that launched the Fancy Feast brand and ran the Friskies Japan division (both part of the Nestle SA family).<br /><br />(According to the SoCal Buzz podcast I listened to, he even worked for Hello Kitty. I particularly loved his remark about cat owners being ""a little more illogical"" than other pet owners, therefore they are more likely to spend money for premium products - I resemble that remark.)<br /><br />Yes, the cat food is produced in Thailand, but it is not associated with any of the companies involved in recalls for Thailand or China, and is not on any of the FDA's lists. They have nutritional facts and a nutrient analysis for each product readily available on their website [...]"
08	20405,B001BDDTB2,A2E2PA6UNK1E05,12/2/08,0,2,5,Two Paws Up!!,"I cannot really comment my own opinions on this product since for obvious reasons I will not be sampling it but I will trust the vendor that it is every bit as good for my cat as they say.  How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />""Meowwwww! Errowwww!"" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.  The noted finickiness of cats usually applies to dry food.  Place a bowl of any random dead animal parts in front of them and they are far more decisive.  Still, this was an especially energetic performance and hence the high rating."
08	20406,B001BDDTB2,A1JMR1N9NBYJ1X,12/1/08,0,2,4,Actually smells pretty good!,"Unlike other fish catfood, this product does not have that strong fishy smell.  Nice flaky chunks of fish in some nice gravy.<br /><br />However Ms Cassiopia lapped up the gravy and left the fish.  This has happened with other food so it is no reflection on the product.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars but since I won't be buying it, I gave it 4.  If your cat will eat food other than pate, you will want to give this a try.  Looks almost like something you would eat.<br /><br />I have given the remainder of the package to a less fortunate friend.<br />Her cat will probably eat it and expect it all the time.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />MEF"

It's really very rich as the ingredients are pure and there is no filler, which is great. Our cats love it more than Fancy Feast or any other higher end cat food!!! A can is eaten up in minutes!!!!<br /><br />Our dogs, of course, love cat food and want to partake in the feast!!!"

08	25717,B0015R9BQG,AKQZNFVEURYYO,2/6/08,2,2,5,Great snack and 10g of protein in 74 calories!,"This is my favorite flavor from Primal Strips.  I like the others but ordered this one last since it sounded weird, but it's great.  The lime flavor is strong and their texture is very good (moist and chewy).  Lowest calories (same as Thai Peanut) from their line.  An excellent no-guilt snack!"
08	25716,B0015R9BQG,A3O8Q6J5O5RB6Q,2/29/08,2,2,5,Awesome veggie snacki,"I absolutely love this stuff -- the mesquite lime flavor is sweet, spicy and tangy, and the consistency of the jerky is chewy yet moist. At 74 calories and 10 grams of cholesterol-free meatless protein, you can't beat it as a snack."
08	25715,B0015R9BQG,A1C0UCSKLZR0I9,5/16/08,2,2,5,Vegetarian and Very Tasty,I have searched for a good vegetarian jerky for several years.  There have been some hits but more misses.  This is one of the best; a great BBQ flavor and a consistency similar to real jerky.  Definitely worth trying.
08	25714,B0015R9BQG,A35OXFCNXOQNUI,6/16/08,2,2,5,finally!,"i've searched high and low for a delicious, healthy, meatless jerky product.  i'm a pescatarian, so tuna/salmon/halibut jerky is great, but super expensive and often incredibly high in sodium.  i found these in the aisles of pcc and absolutely fell in love.  first thing i did was search amazon for them, and here they were!  the price is better, and i knew i would eat these every day.  i take two to work and have at least one at home.  i would recommend these to anyone, carnivore or vegan, looking for a delicious, healthy source of protein.  wow!"
08	20409,B001BDDTB2,A2DV48TSVVVO6V,11/25/08,0,2,5,My cat gave these five stars...,my cat practically inhaled this food!  and it was wonderful... it didn't smell like horrible cat food it smelled like people-food.<br /><br />I recommend this.
08	20410,B001BDDTB2,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,11/24/08,4,4,4,You can see this is quality food when you open the can,"I have 3 cats.  2 are inside and 1 is outside.  They all loved this food, especially my outdoors cat.  Unfortunately, my dog liked it even more, and it became a bit of a problem keeping him away while they were eating, and it normally is not a problem.  He is a very picky dog who loves fish, so I could tell by his reaction that the seafood taste was definitely good.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the can, I could see that this food includes real flake tuna - it is not very much different in appearance than Starkist tuna in the can for people.  It does not have that terrible smell that some wet catfoods do, (Like the Meow Mix Wholesome Goodness).  That is nice, because with some catfoods if you open the can and some flys on you, you have to go shower or smell like a fishmarket.  This food is not stinky like that.  It has a good enough smell to excite the cats, but the human noses here did not smell it in our trash or from across the room.<br /><br />I watched my cats closely, and my dog as well, since he got 'into it' and it treated their digestive systems well. Sometimes new food will make them sick, but this food did not in the least.<br />I am only giving this a 4 star because my cats did not finish the red snapper flavor either time I put it down for them.  They ate maybe 1/2 of it.  I don't think they liked that particular flavor as well as the others.  They ALL liked the yellowfin tuna the best."
08	25706,B0015R9BQG,AK3YI0DS8E4L7,1/10/08,3,3,5,Vegan-licious,"This Hickory Smoked flavor is my favorite of the Primal Strips lot. The strips are moist, tender, unusually flavorful, and just the right size. Even my carnivorous relatives in Wisconsin took to these Strips. My only outstanding concern is that Primal Strips are manufactured in Taiwan, which  means their production is outside the domain of US food safety and inspection. However, having consumed over two dozen of these strips in the past month, I remain happy and healthy."
08	25705,B0015R9BQG,A1I1I37TVC9JOO,8/15/08,3,3,5,Even a snack a meat eater would like,"I am not by any means a vegetarian (I eat my steaks rare), but I do try to eat healthy.  Beef jerky is a great snack if you are on the go (I travel a lot), but the constant intake of red meat is not good for you.  So, I tried the Primal Strip vegan strips.  I have had every one that they make.....and they are all good.  The Thai Satian Peanut is by far my favorite (the hot and spicy shiitake mushroom jerky is my second favorite).  I have recommended this snack to even the most devout meat eaters and they even like it.  I give it 5 stars - but just like everything - they are not for everyone.  I recommend buying them individually first, and if you love it then come back to amazon and get a box (amazon is the cheapest for the boxes)."
08	52952,B00006IDJO,A1NKE5OYRM326V,3/29/08,2,7,1,They Secretly Switched The Coffee At My Favorite Restaurant With This Garbage,"One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it. Someone wanting to be on TV, go figure."

The texture is so ""meat-like"" you will question yourself and re-read the ingredients to be sure is isn't made from animal flesh. I bought a case of the Texas BBQ and a case of the Hickory Smoked.

The others I've experienced have a flat or slightly bitter taste but this one has that subtle essence and sweetness of coconut water drank directly from a freshly opened raw coconut.  Let me tell you, this is the most refreshing, hydrating, and re-energizing elixir you can partake of.  I'll take this over Gatorade any day of the week.  Great way to start off any day."

He absolutely loves them!  A large piece only lasts for a few minutes for him, so they're not really a replacement for the rawhides, but at least it gives him something crunchy to chew on to clean his teeth and satisfy his need to chew.  The vet told me that they would stain my carpet, but they don't.  My only complaint is that they are a little expensive."

This is his reward for enduring his nightly torture."

Open the can and it looks and smells like people food.  The ingredients are basically fish, vitamins, and minerals.  There are no meat by-products or fish by-products and if you know what ""by-products"" are you will be happy about that. If you are concerned about your pet's health, this is a great food. And if your cat is finicky about what she eats, then this is a wonderful food.<br /><br />This size variety pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so if you are sure your cats will like it then it is worth it to buy this size.  Some cats don't mind having the same food every day and some cats might not like each flavor so whether to get the variety pack of 24 or the single flavor pack of 24 is up to you and your cat.  My cats love all 4 flavors and I'll bet your fish loving cat will too!"

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

They must have been Tinkyada employees, friends, or family because there is no way that it tastes five-stars.<br /><br />To be fair, I do eat gluten and it is my wife who has the gluten allergy.  So I do have my own biases as I eat gluten on a daily basis.  My wife tells me that she forgets what gluten tastes like after months of going on the gluten-free diet, and she is able to eat alternatives that I believe do not taste as good as the wheat-full version.  However, my wife is not particularly fond of this product either.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, I bought this thinking this spaghetti was going to taste exactly the same as regular pasta, but the consistancy, though constant, is kind of slimy.  Additionally, the ""energy saving method"" turns the pasta especially gooey, so I do not recommend that method of cooking should you be persuaded based on the other 25 reviews.<br /><br />There are lots of other gluten-free pastas out there, like corn-based, or a mixture of potato, soy, and rice that taste a lot closer to the ""real-thing.""  I haven't found too many alternatives on Amazon yet, but my local grocery store has a few and my wife prefers them over this brand.  So at the moment, I have 11 packets of gluten-free spaghetti that I would be happy to get rid of."

The 3rd cat, notoriously picky, will only eat the yellowfin flavor.  He doesn't seem to like foods with whole chunks in them, but he is very fond of thinner foods with gravy.  There is less gravy in these cans than you find in ""regular"" store bought food, which means you get more actual food.  Good for us, but not so good for my picky cat who wants nothing but gravy!<br /><br />It's somewhat comforting to see recognizable bits of food in the cans.  The shrimp in the tuna & shrimp flavor especially is neat - they're whole salad shrimp.  Also, the food sits well with them.  The price isn't much more than what you'd pay for good food at a pet shop.  All in all I would recommend trying this."

08	20420,B001BDDTB2,A1ZM846Y7AUYD,12/1/08,3,3,4,Healthy Feline Cuisine For Your Finicky Cat(s),"Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called ""potentially harmful"" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim ""Natural"" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that ""Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats.""  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says ""Product of Thailand"", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is ""people food for cats.""  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal."

Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours."

08	20422,B001BDDTB2,ABLKO3TSRPKPP,11/24/08,3,3,5,Good enough to eat--literally!,"I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish broth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.<br /><br />The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein - 13% min, crude fat - 1.5% min, crude fiber - 1% max, moisture - 85% max, ash - 3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.<br /><br />My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.<br /><br />The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a broth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)<br /><br />The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.<br /><br />Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to brand that I feed as a mainstay."

The Pot Pie entr&eacute;e had an awful lot of broth and not a lot of meat.  But we licked the bowl clean anyway.  Mom says she likes this because it doesn't have a strong, icky smell like some canned cat food.  But she says that it would take a lot of these cans to feed it to us all the time (1-2 cans per 2.5 lbs of our weight - she said something about how Lilith could stand to lose a a pound or two or three), so we'll just get a couple of cans along with our dry food.

Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it."

But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.

My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater."

We love Mexican food, and we like to use large amounts of cumin in anything we put chili in.<br /><br />I love the earthy taste.  While developing the recipes for The Collard Patch, we found that cumin goes wonderfully with collard greens.  We also like it with crawfish. Cumin is compatible with many flavors.<br /><br />Here is a popular recipe from The Collard Patch using cumin:<br /><br />  Crawfish Tortellini Salad<br />Ingredients<br />_ cup thinly sliced green onions with tops<br />1 small jar artichoke hearts, drained<br />1 cup small fresh mushrooms<br />1 cup large pitted ripe olives<br />1 cup fresh red bell pepper, sliced<br />1 cup thinly sliced carrots<br />12 ounces frozen crawfish tails<br />1 cup olive oil<br />1 teaspoon salt-free Creole seasoning<br />_ cup red wine vinegar<br />_ cup lemon juice<br />1 tablespoon spicy mustard<br />1 teaspoon Splenda<br />_ teaspoon crushed red pepper<br />_ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br />Salt substitute to taste<br />1 tablespoon minced garlic<br />1 teaspoon cumin<br />1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped<br />1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped<br />1 cup seedless golden raisins<br />1 package (14 ounces) cheese tortellini<br />4 ounces (_ cup) feta cheese<br />4 cups tender baby collard leaves, chopped<br />4 cups Romaine lettuce, torn into small pieces<br /><br />Preparation<br />Place the first 6 ingredients in a big bowl.<br />Place _ cup olive oil in the blender.  Add the vinegar, lemon juice, mustard and all the remaining powdered seasonings.  Blend until it is well mixed.  Stir in the parsley and basil.<br />Pour the blended dressing over the ingredients in the bowl and marinate them covered at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.<br />Saut&eacute; the crawfish in _ cup olive oil and Cajun seasoning about 5-7 minutes.  Even though there will be other seasoning mixed with the tortellini, each individual crawfish needs its own spiciness.  You don't want those crawfish to get lonesome.  After you saut&eacute; them long enough to catch the seasoning, set them aside to cool.<br />Cook the tortellini according to the package directions.  Cook it al dente.  Drain it in the colander and allow it to cool.<br />Toss the crawfish, tortellini, and raisins with the vegetable mixture.<br />When you serve the salad, place it over the greens.

The citrus flavor is noticeably different from other Earl Greys. The box says that in addition to bergamont, other citrus flavors have been added. Personally, I taste a touch of grapefruit in the mix, which makes this tea a bit more lively than your typical blend. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my goto is Bigelow's. I find Twinings to be too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."

That processed flavor added pre-sliced stuff that taste horrible, is even hard to find. We ordered this since we couldn't find a way to order what we usually got back in California, on line. While not quite the same flavor as we were accustomed to, it is still really good salami. It has a bit of a nutty flavor unlike our old usual salami. The pepper in it isn't as uniformly distributed in some of the chubs, some bites will have a stronger pepper flavor than others, but not too strong to make them any less delicious. Unfortunately, the cooling packs that were in the box broke and water logged everything in it. This seems to make the casing with the mold on it hard to remove--I would suggest overnight shipping if you plan on ordering, to avoid this. Five pounds of salami came to 15 little 7 and a half inch chubs, with a refrigerator life of about 2 to 3 months. This is a bit much for two people to eat; unless you eat salami like my wife and I do. This amount would be perfect for a party of 8 to 12 people if that is what you are looking for. Just make sure to slice them thin. If you are one of those unfortunate people who have never had a chub of salami, only the pre-sliced packaged stuff, you really should try this. It's like the difference between good cheese and processed cheese food. While both serve a purpose, only one is edible by itself. Add a bit of provolone and a club cracker and this salami is heaven in every bite!!"

The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box."

It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens!  When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don't like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don't want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the ""soupy"" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup."
08	40362,B000J4DSGK,A3AXD6YWU1K2FX,9/18/08,3,4,5,Great flavor!,"If you think there is no difference in balsamic, you must try this.  I promise you will not be disappointed."
08	20438,B001BDDTB2,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,11/30/08,2,2,5,My 12 cats like this product just fine (details),"With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product! The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended."

I have bought baklava products from literally hundreds of bakeries, including many online bakeries.  No other mail order has even come close to the excellent quality of Shatila.  And price?  Wow; tremendous value for the quantity.<br /><br />Harry and David?  Figis? Please, don't make me laugh. :P<br /><br />So far, I have tried the Mixed Pastries, Cashew Fingers, and Burma.  All are fabulous!  All received raves from my guests; so delicate; so fresh; so well crafted!  I need to give a special shout out for the burma; this incredible creation was hard to keep around for long; absolutely everyone went nuts for it.<br /><br />Mmmm, Shatila; anyone who lives in Michigan is very lucky to have such a fabulous bakery.  From 1500 miles away, I appreciate that even though I chose standard delivery, 6 days did absolutely no harm to the freshness of the items; they were so well packaged, and in such nice display boxes."
08	20439,B001BDDTB2,A3FKPBNI7UWQFW,11/28/08,2,2,4,Cats love it!,"I have one finicky cat and one food-hog cat. Both of them like this food. First ingredient is chicken, good. Next few ingredients are also good, but this is not ""natural"" cat food and thus, includes preservatives and taste enhancers (that I generally avoid). Also, the packaging is cute, but excessive. You get a case of 24 cans, but within that case, are 6 smaller boxes that hold 4 cans each. None-the-less, the quality is superior to ""fancy feast"" or other bottom-rung cat foods. This food is a solid ""medium quality"". The food is what I call ""gravy"" style as opposed to ""loaf"" style, meaning you are paying for a decent amount of gravy in each can as opposed to meat and other real food. To their credit though, the chicken is REAL white meat chicken, not processed chicken parts made to look like ""shredded chicken"". The cats love it and the packaging (though excessive) makes it convenient for storing little cans in your cupboard."
08	20440,B001BDDTB2,A1S78V0MOUYFUA,11/26/08,2,2,4,"Good Quality Cat Food for ""People Food"" Cats","We have two cats, both of whom can be finicky eaters. One cat is a ""people food"" lover; he will eat almost anything that we eat (turkey is his favorite).  The first time we introduced this food to him, he lapped it up.  The other cat does not touch ""people food"" at all.  He took one sniff of this food and turned on his heels.  We tried all flavors and he wouldn't eat any of them.<br /><br />So, if you have a cat who loves ""people food"", Petite Cuisine will probably satisfy him.  This cat food is of high quality with no ""by-products"" and comes in single serving pop-top cans.  Highly recommended for cats that are open to new flavors but may not be for those that prefer to stick with what they know."

This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!"

The savings are even better if you sign up for the auto renew program.  Also, we have found that you can use each cup twice.  Therefore it's like getting twice the quantity for the money.  I checked with the Keurig company and they said by processing the cups for two cups of coffee or tea will not hurt the machine.<br /><br />  Best, Al"

I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.<br /><br />And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.

I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended."

Finished off the can within a couple days!! These are truly very good!!  My only problem is I couldn't find them again in any store around here so I remembered my fav place to shop Amazon.com and knew they wouldn't fail me! Thank you!!
08	20441,B001BDDTB2,AY7XY9E1L6QRW,11/26/08,2,2,4,"They should call it ""Cat Crack""","Yes, they should call it ""Cat Crack"". We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies. It's certainly been better received than almost anything else we've paid a premium for from any grocery store or pet store."

We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good."

The color is dark and the essence is intoxicating.  I have it with milk and sugar and it puts me in a relaxed and warm state of mind.  I can never go back to that other tea!

In this case, I'm thrilled! :)  We just got two German Shepherd puppies -- and have tried numerous chewtoys, Kongs, etc -- but the Busy Buddy is the favorite!  I found that the pups like the rough rawhide rings better than the smooth ones... but they just chew the rough ones first & then go for the smooth.  This bone keeps them occupied for quite a while -- and they'll keep gnawing at it to get the last little bit of the ring off.  I found it lasts longer if you screw the toy together tightly -- that makes it more challenging for them to get the rawhide off.  Great toy!"

The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just ""scented"" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash ""double bergamot"" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both."

When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it."

It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12."

I tried one of each with my two, who love fish and seafood, and they sniffed and walked away.<br />A neighbor's cat and two friend's cats loved it. So, as we all know with cats... they can be finicky! I would have to say give it a try and see if yours like it. They really look great, smaller cans store easily also."

It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him. After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First, I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second, I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it. Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the ""soupy"" broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily. Clearly, my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup."

She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.<br />It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.<br />I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.<br />Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her."

That is a great plus,because these flavors in other brands usually do.<br />There are 4 kinds in this pack. You get 6 cans of each. Red snapper, yellowfin tuna, cod and sole and chuncky tuna.<br /><br />My cats liked the yellowfin tuna best, but they ate all of it. The food is pricey, but worth it if you love to spoil the fur babies."

I like that it's 'kitty healthy,' but the cost is a bit steep."

They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.

08	20469,B001BDDTB2,A2ZJDGVJ45AR5W,12/16/08,1,1,4,Tempted to eat them myself!,"This is quite a unique brand of cat food. Their tagline is ""People food for cats"" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.<br /><br />My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.<br />This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken breast and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars."

Like most of the Senseo brand pods, I find them a quite weak on their own.  However, when you combine a flavored pod with a pod that produces stronger coffee such as the Millstone Home Cafe pods, which contain more coffee, the flavored packs are subtle and wonderful."

But I have three judges at home and as it stands, it's two to one on this food.  One cat likes it and the other wants nothing to do with it.  The dog loves it though!<br />It comes in those little tin cans like Fancy Feast, and you get an decent enough amount I suppose.  It seems a tad pricey, but that's for you to decide.<br />So there you have it-Approved by one dog and one cat.  But bear in mind the third cat is a VERY picky eater."

The other more picky one, not so much.<br />My cats are old though, and weren't raised in this era of healthy cat food, and most of the time wont touch the stuff. So I was happy that at least one of them liked it.<br />I like how all the ingredients are fresh and how there are only a few; not a list 30 things, where half of the words are unpronounceable. The food doesn't smell as bad as most cat food, the kind where as soon as you open it wafts through the house. It also has fresh chunks of chicken and fresh corn and carrots. The gravy in it is very watery and not thick like most cat foods, so it spilled everywhere the first time i opened it. Since then it hasn't, because I haven been more careful.<br />I wish both of my cats liked this food because I know it is so much better for them than what they do like! But I give much kudos to Petit Cuisine on making healthy food for cats."

Frankly, most canned cat food makes mom heave and gag, especially when it's heated for a sickie, so she's actually looking forward to having to nuke some of this.<br /><br />She started with our picky eater, who, not coincidentally, hasn't been here very long and who's never eaten canned food since he's been here, no matter what flavor it was. It took him a minute, but he, too, enjoyed it. The rest of the herd came flying into the kitchen, even the deafie!! The baby with cerebral palsy got so excited she forgot to remove her toes and tail from the door of the feeding cage, did a flip, and almost took a header to the floor.<br /><br />THANKS Petite Cuisine!!<br />Love, the special critters"

This product line should also be popular with humans, because it has a pleasant odor, and it looks like ""people food,"" as the box says.  If you're concerned about issues such as ""gluten free,"" it's that, too.<br /><br />I did feel that the ""Chicken Pot Pie Entree"" had a lot of liquid in proportion to the amount of solids, especially for the price.

I also like the fact that the the ingredients seem to be nourishing (no by-products) although since some reviewers have mentioned a possibly dangerous ingredient, I think I will do a little more research before ordering this again."

I thought they would be similar to the Kinnikinnick cookies we get at our local health food store, but they're not. These are rock hard and although sugary, otherwise have no flavor. We'll stick with the Kinnikinnicks. I'm just hoping maybe I can use these for making a cookie crumb crust."
08	20475,B001BDDTB2,A3FS3FJPD3RJTD,12/10/08,1,1,3,Great Ingredients...If Only They Would Eat It....,"I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better."

My cat eats dry food and this is a treat for her.<br />It is expensive though. It seems like a very high quality food for cats.<br />I would recommend this to someone whose cat is very fussy."

My cats LOVE this cat food, and it is gluten free, so there is no worries about our cats getting poisoned! Great stuff! I'll likely be buying this cat food instead of their regular brand, especially for treats. If your cat likes a lot of sauce, there is plenty of it here, and it's not just water. If you want to give your cats a healthy canned food, this is the best one by far that I've fed them... Better than even the high-end fancy foods. The cans are small, but the nutrition is better than most cat foods. They even use yellow-fin tuna for the albacore! 1st rate cat food!"

The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the ""chicken pot pie"" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up."

My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of ""menadione sodium sulfite in pet food"" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page."

I add it to protein/whey/yogurt shakes, and to give a more chocolatey kick to hot chocolate. I take only half of the cheap hot chocolate mix and add a spoonful of this chocolate. The resulting hot chocolate is much richer and not nearly so sweet. I also use it with Acai powder (Sambazon or Amazon Thunder) and add one or two drops of stevia. Acai/Chocolate blend is really the best for mental energy, not just physical energy; It helps me focus for studying, writing, or problem-solving. This powder is a bit coarse, so it works better in cold drinks if shaken or blended, and in hot drinks you need to stir a few more times than usual. This a good price in a two-pack."

It has 5g of protein in a serving, is unprocessed so you actually get the cacao benefit instead of Hershey crap, and honestly, its the best cocoa I've ever used.  Seriously.

The magnesium really does calm down the nervous system, and don't drink coffee at 11 a.m., but since I found Bedtime Tea, I don't go anywhere without it.  I order 6-12 boxes at a time.  Good Stuff."

They are also very versatile, you can have them with olive oil for bread dipping or better yet, use them to cook chicken, ground turkey burgers, fish, just about anything you can think of. I've tried a few other seasonings at the supermarket but they are waste of money, you get a lot more seasoning and a TON of delicious flavor with the Dean Jacob's seasoning collection."

I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats."

Actually, I bought the halves and pieces, not whole nuts, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry the halves and pieces at this time.  The halves and pieces were about seven dollars cheaper than the whole nuts.  In any case, the whole nuts are still a far better price per pound than you pay in the grocery store for those little baggies of nuts that you have to buy several of to make a batch of cookies.<br /><br />The nuts come in a large foil bag with a resealable ""ziploc"" style closure.

The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends."

They also gobble up the Chinese Chicken (now renamed to Sesame Chicken), but the Chicken Pot Pie is their all-time fave.  I enjoy feeding my cats food that they like as long as it's healthy, and Petite Cuisine is.  It's ""real"" food (no meat by-products) and there aren't any added dyes or preservatives."
08	20483,B001BDDTB2,A1BEKAQQGP8CMF,11/30/08,1,1,5,Source of protein and hearty enough to serve as one meal,"First of all, your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods, because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin, snapper, tuna, and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes, you won't be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn't approve of. There is also a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I"">chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine, which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn't enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary."
08	20484,B001BDDTB2,A1HRYC60VTMYC0,11/30/08,1,1,5,Five Paw Salute !!,"My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it's made from ""Human Grade"" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself.....<br /><br />But ok -- this Petite Cuisine is for my kitties, so let's see what THEY think of it:<br /><br />Well, I had no idea what to expect when I opened the first can --  Chicken Pot Pie (and word of caution -- open the ""Chicken Pot Pie"" can over the sink--there's alot of Broth inside and it sloshes out if you are not careful).<br /><br />However, Big Bad Baby Twinkle was standing behind me watching my every move, and once the top came off the can, her Supreme Largeness, BBBT, surprised me with several OCTAVES worth of Mew-sical praise for the tempting smell.<br /><br />Yes - I know you are supposed to mix new cat food with their old food, but I had no desire to mix this pristine, tasty, fresh diced chicken and veggies entree with any of their stinky canned stuff - so Big Bad Baby Twinkle and Sweet Cee Cee feasted on 1/2 can of ""Chicken Pot Pie"" each, along with the liquid broth. I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of ""water"" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with ""Spot's Stew"" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this ""at home"" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)"
08	20485,B001BDDTB2,A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,11/29/08,1,1,3,More watery than expected; cats are not digesting it well,"Our cats usually get the ""green can"" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back."

The first cat walked over took a little nibble and then went for the full chowdown.  The second cat realized that she was missing out, pushed the older cat out of the way and set about to power eating.  2 happy cats over here.<br /><br />Happy human notes: no BIG fishy smell, no strange looking formed bits,  just some good looking, healthy cat food."

It's real chicken in a clear broth, and it actually looks like something you'd serve yourself.  All the ingredients are ""real"" -- no meat by-products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this."

Happily, the food itself is very healthy and does not contain garbage byproducts. It's not human food but it's darn close. My cats preferred the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp)</a> which I also received, but they certainly didn't turn up their noses at the chicken flavor!<br /><br />My sole complaint is that the chicken-pot-pie variety is very watery.

However, the ""in sauce"" makes things a little messy, especially with the ""Chicken Pot Pie"" entree. There's so much sauce (aka gravy/water/whatever) that my cat would pull the pieces of food out onto the floor and slurp up the sauce afterward. There's just too much liquid in this cat food. The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat -- the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8-pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10-pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.<br /><br />I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative. I say 3 stars, and my cat says 5, for a 4-star average..."

The regular Earl Grey in this brand is also excellent, but the 'double bergamot' variety has a little more flavor than the Stash's regular Earl Grey.  I highly recommend both, and if you are curious like I was, treat yourself to one or both of these, and you will probably never want to purchase any other brand.<br /><br />I'm not sure the reason, but the other brands I've tried just do not taste as good.  Whatever Stash is doing with this tea recipe, it works."

I am giving this a good review before trying it because that's how much I love the Stash Premium Earl Grey.<br />I would recommend newbies to try the Premium first.  This is a winner among Earl Grey teas.  No one does it better than Stash.<br />I'm tempted to try their Chai Spice Tea.  Celestial Seasonings Vanilla Honey is my favorite.

They offer more complex flavors than traditional grocery store brands, and by purchasing them online, you get excellent prices.  My favorite teas of theirs are Calming and Bedtime.  Both seem to offer wonderful side effects of the feelings of relaxation.<br /><br />If you are not a big tea drinker these are still worth a try.  The flavors are complex and unique.  They are not a single note tea.  I have found these teas to never be bitter, and they are quite good without adding extras to make them taste better.<br /><br />I also like the lovely packaging, and the fortunes included on each tea bag.  I have found their blends to be unique and while I generally prefer bulk tea, that these are my favorite bagged teas.  If you looking for a tea that will help take the load off, give this one a try."

The citrus flavor is noticeably different from other Earl Greys. The box says that in addition to bergamont, other citrus flavors have been added. Personally, I taste a touch of grapefruit in the mix, which makes this tea a bit more lively than your typical blend. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my goto is Bigelow's. I find Twinings to be too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."

No, not just because Captain Picard drank it (ok maybe a little) but because I drank coffee for years. Anyway, Earl Grey lovers will really like this tea... the citrus ""bergamot"" flavor is doubled - as the label states.<br /><br />This tea is strong enough (black tea) to wake you up in the morning yet a perfect tea for the evening if you so want.<br /><br />Not recommended for those of you who like a weaker tasting tea. Earl Grey fans - don't wait, get this now!"

I usually use one or two peach tea bags along with 2 family sized black tea bags of the grocery store variety.  This makes 2 quarts of great iced tea, with just a hint of peach.  When I want something special I will use only the peach black tea and serve with a slice of peach.  Summer is coming so I just stocked up!"

Mellow and light. Service from the third party was unexpectedly rapid, and they included extra goodies - additional tea and shampoo. I was highly satisfied. One recommendation for the distributor is to also offer the Sencha Green Tea in the nylon mesh bags. This is what I thought I was getting, and got I believe the same product in a different tea bag. The nylon mesh allows for more mellow brewing."

I couldn't ever taste the tea- and even in my smallest cup it tasted weak and watery.<br /><br />If you want caffeinated cinnamon, go for it.<br /><br />If you want true chai... look elsewhere.<br /><br />PS.  What's with the size of the bags?  Not even 2 grams per bag.  Even for American-style tea bags, this is small."

08	42706,B001ELLAEY,AU5C3IYBH9JCW,7/19/08,0,0,4,Portable Health,"I agree with other reviewers about Agave in general and also specifically this product.  Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.<br /><br />Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.  However, given the above pluses, in the absence of anything better I'm willing to settle for the drawbacks as opposed to putting sugar or -- quel horreur -- artificial sweetners into my body when I'm away from home."

It looks like regular chili, has some fat like regular chili, has a texture like regular chili, and it almost tastes good, if you can get past the salt.<br /><br />This is the second, and last, of this brand and type of veggie product I will try. They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat. A much better, IMHO, veggie chili can be made with some diced onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, a hot chile of your choice, garlic, oregano, chili powder, a little masa, tomato paste, and one or more types of beans, like pintos, kidneys, mayo coba, etc. Just a pinch of salt and your done, or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.<br /><br />I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.<br /><br />Edit: I'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me, so we don't eat too many of them. I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried, vegetarian or not, this compared favorably. But, I can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt. This was the deal breaker for me, as it is with other prepared, canned chilis."

My daughter discovered that the chocolate cake mix makes great brownies if you decrease the baking time. She makes them for all her sleepovers and everybody thinks they are homemade. She also makes a wonderful coffee cake with the yellow cake mix, spreading a mix of cinnamon and brown sugar and cocoa over the batter and swirling it in with a knife. I'm delighted that she has started to bake on her own and that the ingredients are all natural -- Nora's mixes cost a little more than the artificial-ingredients mixes from Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines, but they are worth every penny.

Not overpowering, but still relatively complete, even when brewed as a ""large"" cup, or even 2X small -- many of the K-cups come out tasting thin when you do this, but not this one!  It's so mellow that some may find it to be lacking in unique personality, and I suppose that being a ""medium-bodied"" blend, it doesn't shout out anything at the drinker.  Still, this is a very nice, all-around coffee that is great for everyday drinking."

I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended."

And I'm a total baking (as well as natural foods) snot!<br />Not convinced of my credentials?<br />You should see the rye, sourdough and challah breads out of my oven today.<br />Not to mention the batches of cookies.<br />The amount of flour and butter I go through on a weekly basis for cookies, cakes and breads would let you know: i'm the one person in 100 whom you'd classify as a good home baker. I'm definitely not a ""mix"" baker. And while baking my own birthday cake just seemed un-festive,  asking someone else to bake my cake seemed like it'd spell disaster.  But Someone else offered. And that Someone Else, not as comfortable with my cake pans as I, used Naturally Nora. And both of these baker ""elves"" agree: ""it was delicious and easy to make."" And from my guests' opinions,<br />no one could tell the difference between this mix and home-made. Soooooo tasty. And the icing mixed up as a breeze.<br />Next year, when I'm considering mixing up my own birthday cake or using a Naturally Nora Mix, the decision is easy. Nora.

The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just ""scented"" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash ""double bergamot"" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both."

When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it."

I added some rice, a half can of tomato paste to sweeten it. I also added 6 slices of jalepano with a tablespoon of the juice.  This is really good, and stays true to its intent.  Very healthy choice.<br /><br />For those of you who don't like the salt, just take a half of a small potato. Let it simmer and that will take care of the salt."

Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of ""snack packs"" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie ""fix"" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off."

That is NOT the case with this powder.  This ""Chili Chipotle Powder"" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.<br /><br />The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.

The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby."

They have a 99% as well but I don't think I'm that bold yet!<br /><br />Now, when I eat 60% chocolate it tastes so sweet! Not only is the 85% better because it has more antioxidants but it also has much much less sugar than 35% milk chocolate!<br /><br />If you're not ready for the 85%, start slow. Hershey's has a 45% and 60%!<br /><br />I eat one little square a day whenever I have it in the pantry! Yum!"

The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."

Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years.  After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat.  That may be age related as well.  But the stomach upsets have stopped.  And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula."

08	52986,B001652NBM,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,4/25/08,2,2,5,Excellent sandwich cookie,"Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert."
08	43828,B001EQ5JLE,A2OCINUVTZWBW,10/30/08,34,36,4,A fine and sturdy everyday tea,"This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Many prefer loose tea because tea bags contain the less expensive ""fannings"" or ""dust,"" remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), some people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea."

08	88390,B001EPPYHO,A12K79HZGK3XQV,12/20/08,50,51,2,Neither Orange nor chocolate flavor,We bought this from a candy shop a couple of years ago. Make no mistake - this is not chocolate and it has no chocolate flavor. The orange in its name refers to the color it changes - not to its flavor.<br /><br />The directions call for you to mix the powder with hot water. If you do this it will taste terrible. It becomes only mildly acceptable (to some) when mixed with hot milk rather than water.<br /><br />Its only real use is that the empty cauldron can be used for a decoration around Halloween.

08	27614,B0015D62BW,A135SZUUYGMDGQ,11/27/08,0,0,5,My personal favorite flavor,Buying Jelly Belly this way is roughly $1.50 cheaper by the pound.  The local candy store in the mall does sell it by the pound... and you can pick only the flavors you want.  BUT it is more expensive.  And it seems like every time I pass the store the price has gone up.
08	9582,B000TFKMSG,A37DBBP04I2H32,8/31/08,0,0,5,Good Fruity Gum,"This is a good gum to chew if you are looking to switch from sugared to sugarless gum. It's sweet, and doesn't have a strong aspartame taste, for being sugar-free. It doesn't last 'forever' like the commercials and 'Forever Fruit' name would lead you to believe, but the flavor lasts longer than a lot of sugarless gums, and it has a nice kick of flavor when you first bite in. Everyone in my family likes this flavor of Stride.<br /><br />Don't confuse this with the darker-but-similar-colored-packaging 'Mandarin' flavor."

That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is...""Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack.""  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!"

Very strong Bergamot aroma, and the tea is very fresh (I just drank a cup this morning from a bag I bought in January and it's not stale yet!). The silk bags allow really fast and thorough steeping. Shipping was super quick, and I love that the sachets are all in a single, resealable bag, rather than individually packaged. Less packaging=less to throw away. These are 2-cup sachets, but I use them in regular mugs, just being sure to only steep it for a few minutes. Sometimes I get a second cup out of a sachet if I save it (I'm not a purist, I just like tea!), but if you have a 2-cup teapot these are perfect for that, too.<br /><br />I bought the 50-pack in January and I need to buy another one real soon.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just bought another pack, plus one of the Chocolate Mint, and it's just as high quality as the last. Definitely recommend this tea and seller."

But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.

They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."

It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."

By ""loose"" tea, I just thought it still meant it would be in a tea bag.  I know, don't make fun of me.  I just didn't read it well, and I am not an expert on tea.  Being frugal like I am, I was forced to use the tea anyway.  (I would still like directions on how to make it without a fancy strainer.  It just went straight through my colander.  hee hee) I put the recommended amount in the coffee maker and brewed it that way.  It was way too strong.  I was able to get three gallons of iced tea from the recommended amount for one.  Anyway, after a lot of trial and error, I now have drinkable tea.  Lipton has always been my favorite tea, and after I drink all of this that I purchased, I will probably stick with the loose tea.  Frugality wins always..."

I highly recommend it to all."

I make the best unsweetened tea I've ever had with this tea, and get many many compliments on it.  If you use good water, this tea will last for a day or two without refrigeration, which changes it's flavor.  I am in South Texas and we take our tea very seriously down here.  This strong, brisk, hearty brew is just the thing on a hot summer afteroon.  I haven't experienced stained teeth or other ill effects, either.  Using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter.  It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange/black pekoe blend.  If you try it and it's too strong, tinker with your recipe.  Once you get the ratio right, you'll find it is delicious."
08	10903,B000EM6PC6,A3NYTH5ZUJYA1H,9/4/08,4,4,5,Better Tea,"I love this tea.  I am a long-time tea drinker, and purchased tea bags for longer than I want to count (or think about).  A couple of years ago I decided to go for it...make loose tea, and deal with mess of leaves.  And yes, I did know about strainers and tea balls, but I live in no man-s land.  If it isn't prepackaged, it's unfit to ingest according to the natives.  Good utensils are hard to find.<br /><br />I finally found a wonderful BIG mesh tea ball.  Ahhh, a tea drinker's best friend, right after a good English teapot.<br /><br />The mesh ball in question is like the one sold here as a rule, by the way.<br /><br />Tea is now a breeze to make, and absolutely delicious.<br /><br /> The loose packaged tea put out by Lipton is wonderful.  It has a beautiful taste, unlike their teabags, which can be very iffy.  I've had some that tasted like floor sweepings.<br /><br />This loose tea seems amazingly consistent in flavor.  I recommend it without reservation. And isn't Amazon just lovely...?  They'll bring it right to your door.  How much more could you ask?<br /><br />Earlier I mentioned an English teapot.  I favor Sadler's because of the excellent glaze, and the good material they use in the functional brown teapots they make.<br /><br />A good teapot matters.  Get yourself one, a nice tea ball, and some Lipton Loose tea and you will likely never use teabags again.  If the tea is too strong, do it the way it's done in England; keep a very lightly boiling kettle going, and dilute with boiling water to your taste."

It has been increasingly more difficult to find Lipton Loose in supermarkets, so I have tried to find something to replace it- more expensive, ""fancier"" teas just aren't as good.  This is a great product- sooo much better than tea bags.  We like it hot &/or iced.  People always ask me ""What kind of tea is this?"" and then are so surprised to find out that it is good old reliable Lipton.  Tea lovers- don't be snobs!  Give Lipton Loose Tea a try.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!"

Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat."

Because of great products like this ketchup - I can do that pretty easily most days!  My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no-salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!<br /><br />Heinz no-salt ketchup tastes wonderful!  It has a slightly stonger tomato flavor, but I wouldn't have guessed it was no-salt.  I use it for homemade BBQ sauce, french fries, etc - it's awesome!  Highly recommended."

The boxes are small, however, only 8 ounces, so you'll need a couple for a family-sized meal.<br /><br />I find spelt to be a better tasting alternative to traditional wheat over rice and corn pastas.

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."

I chose this decaf because it's made with the Swiss Water Method, meaning there are absolutely no harmful chemicals.  I continued to drink the Dark Roast while breastfeeding, but after that I started drinking regular coffee again.  However, after just a month, I'm switching back to this Dark Roast Decaf.  I like the taste, and I feel healthier drinking it.  Like the previous reviewer, I probably make it a little stronger than the instructions specify--but then I do that with all coffee.  If you're looking for a healthy alternative way to start your day (sans Folgers in your cup), this is a good option."

He's built up his speed to get the rawhide rings off the spools, but he's still interested in it and can't wait until I reload it.  Just be sure to remember which size toy you purchase...I accidently bought the wrong size replacement rings.  Luckily, they work at all sizes, but the treat after all the effort on his part is not the same.  Better than a Kong, which I'll probably be donating to the shelter dogs who would settle for less."

The difference in taste to regular anchovies & these salted one ones is like the difference of filet mignon to a fast food hamburger...unless you LIKE fast food...<br />It may seem expensive to buy this many, however, they last indefinitely, and one will usually take the place of a whole can of the grocery store variety.<br />Yum!"

We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).<br />So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now)."
08	88411,B001D0KG4Q,A31GQ2U36G30IG,10/5/08,37,41,5,VARIETY PACKS - THINGS TO KNOW,"While variety packs sound like a good idea, you should be aware that there is a reason you usually aren't told exactly what's in it. It's because almost always, the vendor throws in a bunch of flavors, blends, teas, and decafs that are not usually what you want. It can be a waste of money for most.<br /><br />A much better solution, besides sampling a friends K-cup favorites, is to go onto the Keurig site ( http://www.keurig.com/KCupResults.asp?AllProducts=AllProducts&mscsid=HGR8G81WMFQB9NS0DN0EH4MKJREN8UAF ) and buy their low cost 5 packs. They usually cost under $3 and give you enough coffee to help decide what you might like. Plus, you'll know exactly what's in the smapler before you buy it.<br /><br />It is also a great idea to visit the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo http://groups.yahoo.com/group/K-CUP/  This site is an excellent source of K-Cup info and allows you to trade unwanted k-cups, and talk to others to find the best deals and brewing tips."

Since I'm still nursing my baby boy  I have given up caffeine and needed something to feel energized. As a new mother I wanted to keep up with my son as he is so full of beans all the time. For many years I have tried all kind of products in the name of health and wellness. So I'm excited to finally find a product that suits my busy schedule called Chi Green Tea Extract. Its really easy to use , I drink a full dropper of Chi Tea in warm water every morning. I find the taste of both to be delicious and I actually crave drinking it I have noticed a more steady flow of energy throughout the day since using Chi Green Tea Extract. and friends have commented that I'm glowing and looking younger (Its not just the mothers glow)<br /><br />The website I order Chi Tea is at [...] . I have found it very informative and have provided me with all kinds of fascinating facts. I enjoyed learning about anti-aging properties of green tea. Epidemiological observations have shown that people in green-tea consuming countries-mainly Japan and China-have very low rates of cancer. In Japan, the women who teach the tea ceremony, and thus drink more than the average amount of extra-strong green tea, are noted for their very low mortality rate and longevity; deaths from cancer are especially rare in this group.<br />I sent my mother a bottle in Australia and she has seen an improvement from her high blood pressure, stomach problems, tiredness and varicose veins. After drinking the Chi Tea for a few days her blood pressure was back to normal and after a couple of weeks her stomach problems completely improved.<br />I found some great research on the website [...] about the magical benefits of green tea.  Dr. Earl Mindell in his Super Antioxidant Miracle book describes ways in which green tea could help you. These ways include protective safeguards against possible breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, intestinal cancer, skin cancer, and stomach cancer. ""Further,"" he states, ""it prevents oxidation reactions in the brain, acts as an antibacterial against harmful digestive bacteria, it cures gum disease, it lowers oxidized LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol, it lowers triglycerides, inhibits viruses such as HIV, hepatitis, and herpes viruses, and acts as an antioxidant protestant against damage to blood vessels. Not only are there so many scientific facts about the benefits of Green Tea.<br /><br />Chi Tea has been endorsed by by Dr "" Tea""Mark Ukra. Dr Ukra has been on Oprah several times and uses the product daily. Its also on the menu at his famous Teagarden Tea house in Beverly Hills. Click here for more info. I really just enjoy the taste of Chi Green Tea Extract. Its convenient and will make a great Christmas present to family and friends. This year the best present I believe that I can give to loved ones is good health."

It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.<br /><br />The juices it contains are: white grape juice, apple juice, blackberry juice, and lemon and raspberry juice concentrates. It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!<br /><br />Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy). The adults in my household really like it and I think children would enjoy it too. There's really nothing not to like about this healthy juice or soda alternative beverage!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

Izze is a wonderful combination of juice and sparkling water. The blackberry flavor is a blend of grape, apple, lemon, raspberry and, of course, blackberry. The mixture together seems to taste as much like blackberry as popping a fresh punch of blackberries into your mouth.<br /><br />The sweetness is the natural sweetness of fruit, and there is nothing added to make it artificial tasting. This is a super substitute for ordinary sodas. It's a much healthier choice!<br /><br />Very highly recommended!"

The price from Amazon is about half that of the local market. The problem is that many of the packets in the case came with many cracked(broken)crackers; no pun intended. I will give it one more try.

All of a sudden they have disappeared from the shelves of both of our local grocery stores, so I'm glad to find that I can still get them through Amazon. I eat them with Kefir(TM) yogurt drink poured on top and they are really pretty tasty (but we still call them ""gerbil pellets"" ;-)."
08	42671,B001D0GV9K,A22BFCC463LD0O,10/9/08,5,5,3,I don't taste the hazelnut,"I usually like Timothy's coffees, so I thought for sure I would like the hazelnut version.  It doesn't taste or smell like hazelnut coffee.  I can drink it, but I think Van Houtte and Gloria Jeans makes a better version of it."
08	88421,B001D0KG4Q,A33XHB842ZD7MX,6/20/08,3,3,3,Good but ... Timothy's needs a coffee-only variety pack,"The box contains a true cross-section of coffee types, from flavored types to darkest roast. The Rainforest Espresso was a favorite dark roast, and the Columbian Dorado was the ideal medium roaster (IMO). Others in my family have different tastes though, so your mileage may vary as well.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the heavy presence of teas included here, raised the cost-per-cup significantly. Nobody in our home likes hot teas, and although I did get one good iced-tea conversion, the effort expended removes convenience from the picture.<br /><br />Bottom line: Timothy, you need a coffee-only variety pack!! Maybe one with some more varieties in addition to the coffees already there. I would then rate the score upward to a 5. As it is, the ever-present frustration of seeing those darned teas in there, takes some of the fun out of deciding which K-Cup to brew next.<br /><br />Just a closing thought - Big Cat Coffees offers a build-your-own box of five selections (including Timothy's), which IS very useful, but not much different in price."
08	88423,B001D0KG4Q,A26C4GW1JQ8PTN,1/13/08,2,2,4,Just read the fine print,"Yes, it does include tea, and a lemon drink, but now amazon does state that in the description.<br />What I found slightly disappointing was that I had mixed quantities of each item in the 48 pack.  I had 2 of some drink and 4 or 5 of another.  Makes me wonder if I was missing any flavors.  Just be prepared for a true variety.  I found Timothy's coffee's to be a much bolder, stronger taste than the Gloria Jean's variety I tried."

The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it."

When delivered the plastic wrap was ripped and in direct contact with the packing material.  The Ice pack were melted.  It would be better if packed with at least two plastic barriers and dry Ice.  I ordered meat from Ohmaha meats and I came packed in a styrofoam cooler with dry ice and in good condition.

I went to place my order and was pleased with the item price and then was hit with the shipping!!! Wow shipping was a little high. I figured it was due to the special shipping of meat. I think it took a little long and was not  to pleased with the shipping time. Over all the meat was great and I got my Gyro sandwich just  let down on the shipping.

It has a delightful smell<br />when the envelope is opened and when the tea is brewed.  Green tea has<br />health benefits but the green chai is much more fun to drink than most<br />green teas.
08	62732,B000I1OLT2,A3NKRBAWSVGMLA,2/23/08,9,10,5,This is the tea that converted me from coffee,"And I was drinking good coffee too. This is my absolute favorite tea. It's great with milk and a splash of honey. I tried other chais, but the spices were often overpowering. This one is so good I bring some with me when I travel, since restaurants rarely have it. If you like this flavor, ordering in bulk is the way to go. The cost per box is almost half that in grocery stores."

I mix it in Stoneyfield no-fat unsweetened yogurt, and have it for breakfast.  It is sweet enough that it compensates for the blank yogurt, and makes a great meal.  I especially like th banana chips, and nuts.  Nothing in it is too hard for my sensitive teeth.  I've tried Udi's other flavors, which are good, but this is by far the best.  A great value too, when you purchase 6 bags."

By about 10:30p he starts anticipating getting his nighttime treat and he won't leave me alone until I give him his Greenie.  I had a Sheltie-mix who didn't care for Greenies but this guy loves 'em.  The vet says they're good for him and we've never experienced any problems digestively speaking so if your four pawed friend is a Greenie fan, too, this is certainly a great price.  Shipping was reasonable, as well ... particularly when ordering several boxes ... and quick."

My husband started eating it for a late night snack and then started eating it for breakfast - and I was lucky to get a couple of bowls for myself.<br /><br />We like all the flavors, but I like the ""Original"" best.  I enjoy the crunchy, freshness and it's not overly sweet like many granolas are. I'd rather add a little honey than gag on super sweet cereal.<br /><br />highly recommended!"

When I returned to the bay area I looked in every store I could for it and found it at one quite a distance from my home. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I buy the pack of 6 and go through it in a month. Its all I want for breakfast... not oatmeal or eggs for me anymore.  That's why I say, caution this is addictive.<br />Enjoy the best granola you'll ever eat.  I love the fresh nuts but there are too many raisins for my taste but I pick them out.  That's the only thing I'd change.. take out the raisins."

It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!"

Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares."

They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack."

08	40017,B00017LEY8,AYTOUNZYWKRGL,2/11/08,4,7,1,Limited applications,Although this popcorn was advertised with the Presto Poplite hot air corn popper it is too small and too light to work with this machine. It is even stated in the instructions that came with machine as not recommended type to use. Made good duck feed though.

08	62779,B000I1OLT2,AC8UT5SYUP313,11/15/08,2,2,4,Yum!,The Moroccan Mint Green Tea by Stash is simply delightful.  I generally enjoy 1-3 cups a day (considering I have six boxes to consume) and each one is delicious.  The mint and lemongrass keep the tea from being too astringent.

I would recommend that everyone give it a try, as they will really enjoy eating it with no kernels stuck between the teeth. Tasty, too."
08	39996,B00017LEY8,A2V2FL4XWQ3TU4,8/28/08,4,4,5,"Best popcorn, hands down","I've tried a wide variety of popcorns, and generally find the quality of this brand to be excellent.  The Lady Finger popcorn is by far my favorite of all the brands and varieties of popcorn I've tried.  It's tender, flavorful, and a bit sweet; highly recommended."
08	39991,B00017LEY8,A3EICZTLGAJQFL,3/5/08,22,23,5,I loved it,"I popped some last night and I love this popcorn. If you like large poofy kernels then this is not for you, but I like small kernel popcorns too, and this one was light and a little crunchy and had good flavor. I think the selling point of this type is that the hulls shatter when it pops (""hullless""), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. I think the popcorn kernels have to be small to be hullless.<br /><br />If you have an air popper and find that small kernel popcorns fly out of it, you could try a different cooking method - I just pop mine in a saucepan on the stove (with a little bit of vegetable oil, and a lid to keep it from flying out), there are also air poppers that don't let the popcorn fly out, or I've seen a microwave bowl that's like air popping but with the microwave as a heat source (but no added oil or anything, like air popping), or some people even just use a paper bag in the microwave (I think with this method they use a little oil too). There are many ways to cook popcorn, and instructions are pretty easy to find on the internet if you need them."

I would have never thought that there are big differences between gummi bears, but there are. Some are too sweet, too mushy, too chewy, too sticky, etc.  These bears are just right.  Germany carries some of the best candies and chocolates and these gummi bears are the best of the bunch!  If I order 5 pounds gummi bears, I will eat 5 pounds in a short amount of time, so I cannot order from Amazon.  I have to get them in a retail store and get one small bag at a time, otherwise I will gain lots of weight in gummi bears!"
08	604,B000G6RYNE,A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,12/15/08,1,1,5,"One bite and you'll become a ""chippoisseur""","I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

08	62830,B000I1OLT2,A2V18JN5XI2GOB,11/28/08,1,1,5,Good Stuff.,"I like this better than the Bigelow that I was drinking before and the price is really good.  This is actually the first tea of any kind that I've been able to drink without adding artificial sweetener or honey.  It has a nice subtle flavor and, on a wholly superficial note, the beautiful green individual packages look lovely in a glass container on the counter."
08	81347,B000I5FN7C,A1FWFCJU2G7TRA,2/12/08,1,1,5,"Woof, Woof, great treats!",My dog is very picky. I tried these treats because he doesn't care for rawhide or 'chewy' types. These are baked and smell wonderful. Very crunchy and you can break them in two if you want. They come in a zip- lock bag to keep them fresh. They are a bit pricey (I wish they'd come in larger numbers) but well worth it for my dog.

Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
08	57910,B000EVOSE4,A1S2U7YG3K11HZ,12/2/08,1,1,5,Excellent gummy candy,"Just a note: this is a LOT of candy. If you are ordering this make sure you have a lot of friends and family that will help you finish off the bag.<br /><br />After the first handful (which is excellent, mind you) I was set for a few days. Apparently no one else in the house cares for gummy candy and it took me a few weeks to finish up the candy.<br /><br />Other than that, they taste good and have a good chewy consistency. These are premium gummis and are highly recommended."

When you have a child on a gluten-free diet, saving time on food prep is always appreciated.  They are definitely a favorite in my house.  We love them.  They are small in size, but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten-free."
08	10946,B000EM6PC6,A3M8R4JD1SIS76,5/30/08,0,0,5,Boxed Nostalgia,"Lipton Loose Tea, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PC6"">Lipton Loose Tea, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, is a reminder of the way things were when I was a little child.  My mother, all her sisters, my grandmother, and all our friends considered Lipton Loose Tea to be TEA. There was no other for them.  I grew up thinking anything else was an ""off"" brand.  (Lipton Tea is America's favorite tea.)<br /><br />In the South most people make it sweet.  They add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required.  Now I prefer to use Splenda (SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)) and lemon juice. This tea has a strong black-tea taste.  It is robust and pure.<br /><br />When I moved across the Mississippi River, I was shocked to discover that people in Louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in Mississippi. I think one reason my people liked Lipton Loose Tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible.  It was always a good bargain.  Almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain.<br /><br />Nutritonally it is outstanding.  It is a means of hydrating, which is considered important.  (Always hydrate responsibly:  don't drink too much! You would not want to drown.) Also it is an excellent source of flavonoids, which provide antioxidants. A glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  Since the ingredients vary with different practices, it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine.<br />Some caffeine can help many people.<br /><br />On my blog, which you can find at Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, I talked about my mother's tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds.  The name of the blog entry is ""Myrtle's Stuffed Eggs.""<br /><br />About stains -- it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea.  Also, you can clean glasses, pitchers, etc., with baking soda. One more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth. (I do this, but I don't think it helps much.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful."
08	88503,B000VBYI7Y,A347XPCKWQ8BPF,11/18/08,0,0,5,Great to have on hand!,"These are great.  I like the fact that they are in portion controlled bags which make them easy to throw in a book bag, carry-on bag or lunch box.  They are a bit hard so they don't crumble easily before you get to them.  The taste is similar to cinammon graham crackers."

This product has a pleasant flavor, yet doesn't over power the foods I put it in. It helps to keep my digestive track regular. I ground it in my coffee grinder and just sprinkle it on just about everything. My husband and I love it in pancakes. I enjoy it in my cereals and even on ice cream. I especially like it mixed in my yogurt. I highly recommend this product."

Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"

08	25442,B0051TPWUI,AM9LRYG6YXV83,6/2/08,5,5,5,"Unique product, well executed","The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS.

08	2549,B000ED9LDU,A1WNJ4AP6KWDJP,3/28/08,5,5,5,Great source for omega3's!,"It's best to buy flaxseeds as opposed to flaxseed oil or meal because you get more omega3. Since you are grinding the seeds yourself, the released omega 3 oils are at their freshest.<br /><br />I recommend storing these flaxseeds in the freezer. You can keep them there after you open them as well. I grind 2 tablespoons in a coffee grinder and then add it to yogurt or a protein shake. Good stuff!"

The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state."

The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon."

08	7899,B000E8PXTG,A1WV453FLGP59,11/15/08,0,0,5,Best instant noodle cup,I really enjoy this noodle cup mostly because of the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the soup. The noodles taste firmer and less like the cheap kind that would regularly come out of one of these instant noodle packages. The flavoring has just the right amount of spice and is not excessively spicy.
08	7897,B000E8PXTG,A1CS5JDV6YZQ8V,6/3/08,5,6,5,Tasty,"As far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best I've had. Actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies, mostly mushrooms and onions that I could make out. Descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix. They don't show it on the picture here but I'm pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup. It looks exactly like the one I just had but the words 'hot and spicy' are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic. If you like spicy noodles definitely don't pass this up.<br /><br />Very good"

What I love about No Pudge is that you can make a single serving.  Directions are on the box.  I mix two tablespoons of my favorite lowfat yogurt (the BEST is Axelrod black cherry - which makes this a Black Forest brownie) with 1/4 cup No Pudge mix and pop it in the micro for two minutes. This is a double brownie.  The single brownie is too dinkie to satisfy me.  Then I slather the rest of the yogurt over the brownie.  The creamy yogurt mixes through the chewy brownie and is my hands down favorite send my belly to bed happy nighttime snack.  5 weight watchers points with the double serving and yogurt."
08	14991,B000EGZ99M,A1EEZZAZVKHSNX,12/13/08,2,2,5,Great food,"We've been looking all over for a wheat orzo and decided to try this. It has worked very well in all our orzo recipes, hot and cold, save for one that was just OK. It has a stronger flavor than regular pasta made with bleached flour, so it does best in recipes with bolder flavors. Like most wheat pastas, it needs to be boiled for just the shortest amount of time, so that it remains very firm. We haven't overcooked it yet, so I can't say if it will get mealy and mushy like a lot of wheat pastas do. Highly recommended."
08	14992,B000EGZ99M,A1KL8X67ZL8NE1,8/21/08,2,2,5,Great stuff,"Whole wheat orzo is pretty hard to find in the stores.  I try to eat only whole grain pasta, bread, etc.  I love the texture and it is delicious.  I don't mind buying 4 jars at once because dried, sealed pasta keeps for so long."

They are fresh and ready to eat in no time at all with a chewy, gooey, chocolate-y flavor.  I like to add a scoop of Frozen Cherry Yogurt to the top of the still-warm brownie.<br /><br />Did I tell you how easy they are to mix-up? The package is complete. You just add some yogurt.  And the best part...it's easy to just mix enough for a couple of brownies and then pop them in the microwave.  That's if you don't want to mix up (and probably eat) the whole pan at once.<br /><br />I also like the packaging for these.  The boxes stand up easily in my pantry and because of the hot pink color they are always very easy to find.  These are a wonderful treat that you really don't have to feel bad about enjoying. I give them 4 stars only because I think they are a bit pricey...but then, as we all know, usually you get what you pay for. Recommended!"

In fact, they are the best I've ever had. When my wifre made them and told me they were fat free, I was thinking ""ok here we go - these are going to taste bad"". I couldn't believe it when I took a bite. I thought she was playing a trick on me and made another batch of real brownies and gave them to me. Once I tried them, she couldn't get the pan away from me. Amazing. You will love them. As for Kevin - there are something wrong with your taste buds bro. Get it checked out."

I also don't like fat-free foods because of all the chemicals and added sugar that usually goes into them to give them something resembling their full-fat texture.<br /><br />This product really is different from all those other fat-free products, though, and I genuinely enjoy it.  The ingredients are all things I typically would keep in my cupboard without feeling the need for a biohazard sticker on the door (if only I had time to bake).<br /><br />The fact that one can make an easy single-serving brownie in the microwave is an added bonus for all of us who don't live with a big family of people who will eat our homemade creations, or who simply don't have time to make a pan of homemade brownies.  I concede that these are not as good as a gourmet fudge brownie, but they are precisely what I'd hoped they'd be when I got them: yummy, quick, easy, economical, and above all chocolatey.<br /><br />My favorite serving suggestion: drop a few chocolate chips in the cup before putting them in to bake."

It is extremely moist and is most delicious when sliced thin to accompany a cup of coffee. The ingredients are perfectly blended as no one taste is overpowering, but you are able to taste each individual ingredient.  If you are looking for a great coffee or tea accompaniment, please give this cake a try!"

I'm still using a bit of espresso with mine - I make lattes with hemp milk, 1 scoop Teeccino, and half a scoop espresso, slowly weaning off the espresso. I am weaning off the caffeine, but will soon be on a diet where I can't have any fruit for a while. This is the only down-side to this product - that and it has barley, which is not tolerable by those who are gluten-sensitive. Taste-wise though, I like it! And I really like that you can brew it however you desire, and that it's not just another instant powder."
08	15009,B000EGZ99M,ALZYQF2FMIL1J,11/16/08,0,0,4,Tastes pretty good,The whole wheat orzo tastes pretty good and it a good substitute for regular pasta if you are watching your card intake.  It's also hard to find whole wheat orzo in a supermarket so online may be your best bet.

This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry."

08	19247,B001E5E20O,AMGTRN3KTZY8C,5/5/08,0,0,5,The best Earl Grey there is,I have to agree with many of the posters below. Earl Grey is my favorite tea and I have tried every brand I have ever come across. I was completely floored by how good this tea is. It is absolutely the best Earl Grey I've ever had and that includes some pricey gourmet blends. And what a bargain: 3 tins for less than $20! Don't waste your time with anything else.

Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Blackberry.  Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry.  Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.<br /><br />This is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me.  That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage.  A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book.  The only issue I had is the calories."
08	84408,B000ETAJZ8,A2GJ13F7WIYX2E,3/31/08,3,4,4,The way the cookie crumbles,"These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again."

The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"

08	490,B000G6RYNE,A1B05INWIDZ74O,6/2/08,0,0,5,These will be habit forming!,"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat."

After the surgery, I still found that I had to take Metamucil every morning and also eat the Bran Buds too.  I sweeten the Buds with Sugar Free Coffee Mate Hazelnut creamer and it is really good.  I just love it even though I have to eat it every day.  Along with the Metamucil, they have solved my life long problem of constipation.

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!"

08	34792,B000I1RHMU,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,9/25/08,5,5,5,Interesting blend,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."

I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

Just add fat free vanilla yogurt, mix and microwave for a single serving...top with fat-free Cool Whip or frozen yogurt.  Can double the single serving and still microwave for just a little longer for a larger ""single"" serving.  Would suggest measuring when making single servings since much of a variation in the ratio of mix:yogurt will change the consistency of the brownie."

However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it."

However, the product pictured on Amazon showed a package of 12 Large Greenies for $14.99 and what arrived was a package of 8.  That price I can beat at several of my pet stores.  I had ordered 3 packages based on the 12 Large/$14.99 and since they weren't as advertised, sent all 3 back."

She's of the opinion that Baxter's is absolutely the BEST canned soup on the Planet (of the soups she's tasted, which include the major American brands - she doesn't cook much). The Lobster Bisque rated just below Baxter's Scottish Smoked Salmon (which she rated the BEST EVER). (From my own perspective, and usually cooking my own food, I have to admit that the Baxter's soup line, for canned soup, is superior)."

They arrived in good condition (ie, not much breakage, unlike another brand of crackers that arrived in the same box, which were mostly DOA.) If you like the original, you'll probably like these if you're looking for a wholegrain substitute for the original."

I was making them with yogurt but have switches to unsweetened applesauce. just a little tip. They are hard to cut so we tried making them in a muffin pan it works great. you get 12 individual brownies. Just grease the pan add the batter then bake for 22 to 23 minutes. about 2 minutes after taking them out of the oven get a fork and gently nudge one corner to get them out of the pan, do this to each one.then let them cool. works great. I like mine moist so I put them in an airtight container while they are not totally cooled. Enjoy these great brownies!!!!"
08	25323,B00110JI4M,AXDUSPY46V3R,12/2/08,2,4,2,Macaroni integrity is the pits,"I have bought this at my local grocery store, and tried it several times before giving up on it.  It tasted very similar to regular Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, but no matter how little I tried cooking the pasta I could not get it to an al dente state such that the noodles didn't fall apart as soon as I started stirring to create the cheese sauce.  I think the last time I made it I cooked the noodles for 5 1/2 minutes (the box recommends 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 minutes) and they still fell apart.  Eating this was like eating macaroni shreds and cheese, not macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />My 21-month old son will eat this, but he prefers the regular version. I do, too, so we're giving up on this one."

Chip is sweet and has a great nutty taste. They are salted just right, so with each bite you get a salty sweet combo that is delicious.<br /><br />My kids love these and since they are multigrain and 30% less fat than potato chips.  This makes them good for your heart, so they are better for everyone than potatoes."

This does just have a little fiber, but it's a lot better than the other kraft mac and cheese products, with the same taste my kids love.  They turned their noses up at the other brands of mac and cheese that have more fiber.  They never notice any difference with this."
08	25320,B00110JI4M,A1JOANG98KBFKU,9/30/08,0,0,4,Good price. Good product. Not too grainy for whole grain,"My family went to eating all whole grains several years ago while doing the South Beach diet. We gave up mac and cheese reluctantly and tried several ""other"" brands to satisfy the craving. None could compete. If you grew up on Kraft mac 'n' cheese with the bright yellow might-be-cheese sauce, you miss it.  My daughter loves mac but would only get it at ""Grandma's"" house because I didn't keep it around much.  I was excited to find out about this product, but only to find no local stores who carried it. Thank you, Amazon! It is well worth the price and tastes just like the original, just with a stronger wheat flavor.  I felt the cheese sauce should be made a little stronger to compensate for the strong wheat flavor of the pasta. We don't mind the wheat taste, but some other people aren't as fond of it. If you don't care for the taste of whole wheat pasta, this probably isn't for you. We, however, will definitely reorder."

The brownies are wonderful & super easy!  My hubby who hates anything that even looks low-fat LOVED these brownies!<br /><br />Happy Eating!"
08	25316,B00110JI4M,A21S0K5PU4YO9L,4/30/08,5,6,4,good choice for those trying to make the switch to whole wheat,"Okay, first off...if you can't stand regular Kraft Mac-n-Cheese don't bother with this product.  It's a LOT like regular Kraft MnC. It's been made with pasta with 50% whole grain.  Okay, nice compromise there; the 100% whole wheat pastas can be a bit grainy tasting but we know we all need less white flour in our diets.<br /><br />Now, you're discerning 5 year old will probably be able to tell the difference between this and regular Kraft MnC and if he or she is uber-picky about change, demands a certain brand, etc, well, then, this won't fool him.  But my kids ate it up fine.  The 9 year old barely noticed anything different (but she likes WW pastas), the 7 yo who normally doesn't like WW MnC ate it, although could tell it was WW.  The 2.5 year old just kept shoveling it in with his bare hands; I guess that means he liked it.<br /><br />So in a nutshell, this is a worthwhile product to try if you're kids like Kraft MnC.  Same flavor as far as the sauce goes at least.  Same shape of noodles.  The fiber content for a serving of this is a respectable 5g, up from 1g for the tradtional stuff.  Not bad.<br /><br />Of note is the fact that this product has only 6oz in a box as opposed to the 7.25oz in the traditional MnC.<br /><br />For comparison's sake, I usually buy the Hogson Mill 100% WW Mac-n-Cheese.  I found this a bit milder tasting as far as wheaty-ness goes; makes sense as Kraft uses a blend and HM is 100% whole wheat.  My picky eater will eat the Kraft but not the HM.  Hope that helps those of you with similar customers to feed.  I found the Kraft brand in my stores for a little less money than what it's being sold on Amazon for, but it might be hard to find in the stores for many people."

08	63059,B000GZYAN2,AY3DRQDBR8QRW,1/20/08,7,49,1,These brownies are horrible,"Here's a review by someone who is not fat, not on a diet, and who has not ruined his palate with fat free confections:<br /><br />These are the worst brownies I have ever tasted!  My wife bought this mix because it was the only one available at Trader Joe's when she shopped.  She didn't tell me they were fat free, but as soon as I tried one, I knew.  It had all the hallmarks of fat-free baked goods - gummy, flat, and the chocolate tasted like cocoa powder, not like rich fudgy chocolate.  I almost had to spit it out, it was that awful.<br /><br />And do you want to know why fat free foods taste so bad?  I'll let you in on a little secret:  the secret ingredient in good-tasting food is... you guessed it - FAT!!!!!  Fat and oil molecules transport the lovely taste of foods onto your taste buds.  So stop being so afraid of fat!  A little bit won't kill you!  Just exercise a little self-control and don't eat the entire box.  One properly made brownie is more satisfying than a whole plate of these vile things.<br /><br />So if you like real food that tastes good, don't believe the reviewers that raved about these brownies.  These people have a hidden agenda - they are trying to convince themselves that these little nuggets of evil actually taste good and are good for them."

Of the many brands I tried, most all were roughly the same in taste, texture, etc.  But these Honey Stingers stood out to me.

It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."

I discovered that I can make these muffins, sccop them into my silicone muffin cups and then freeze the entire batch (usually 18 muffins).  Taking them out one or two at a time to bake in my convection oven each morning.  I start each day with fresh baked muffin(s)."

I was introduced to it by my sister-in-law, who hails from Great Britain.  She said it was all she ever drank there, but could not find it here.  We are both so very pleased to be able to purchase it quickly and easily on Amazon.com--and for a very reasonable price."

But, was I the only one who saw the movie ""Serendipity"" in my family? These packets of ""Frozen Hot Chocolate"" are just as delicious as everyone (in the other reviews) says they are. (Which makes me doubly happy that I ordered them!) Before they even arrived, I thought how silly I was to only order one set and went back and ordered more. My son and I just had to try it out before we gave these away for the holidays. It is even great mixed with ice cream. My only complaint is that the shipping is quite steep for these lightweight packets. Otherwise, I am a very happy customer!"

The addition of Aspartame gives it that distinct aspartame taste. The after taste is also unsavory.Putting in fresh lemon juice was the only way I could drink it.<br /><br />I don't consume very much sugar, still I thought I'd try it. I would prefer to have no sugar at all than have aspartame in it.<br /><br />Occasionally I drink regular tea with lemon, but no sugar.<br />This is just my personal opinion, but when I'd read up on Aspartame being a possible carcinogenic, I never used it again until recently.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it's healthier to diabetics who want a somewhat sweet taste, but for myself, I don't like chemicals, only natural drinks and flavors."
08	43812,B001EQ5JLE,AN0H6X2L9N71D,12/2/08,0,0,5,Just Right,"This tea is exactly what I was hoping for after reading the reviews here.  Using loose tea in my office is more time consuming and creates more of a mess in my very rudimentary office kitchen than I want to deal with.  These tea bags are flavorfull, not bitter and I really appreciate that they have more cafeine than the basic domestic mass market tea bags. They give me the small afternoon boost that I need.  You can easily find higher quality varietal or blended tea and I have those in my cupboard at home and do use them when I have time for the fuss and want to savor something special, but I am really happy with these easy to use, inexpensive tea bags that make a quick just right cup of tea - either at the office or at home."
08	20719,B0001IVR8A,A1YUH8F7HM5T3Y,5/11/08,1,2,5,Yum,This stuff is a great option if you don't live near the restaurant.  Shipping was kinda ridiculous though.

I'm not one of them.<br /><br />If your goal is to find a quick-to-make unsweetened tea, you might consider bottled tea instead. This stuff tasted really bad to me.<br /><br />If you sweeten it, its probably fine. I know their sweetened varieties are good."

I opened the door, yelled for the driver to come back and pick up the box and handed it back to him with tea pouring out of the box.<br /><br />After contacting Amazon and explaining what happened I recommended they have the boxes marked fragile as they were glass.  After several weeks I came home to find a box on my porch marked with 2 fragile stickers.  I picked it up and heard the broken glass and tea once again pouring out of the box.  Opening the box I found 2 jars of the 6 shattered.  The box was over sized with the jars simply lying inside rolling around and it was easy to see how they break.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this product from Amazon unless you like destroyed product."

They are more hot than sweet, so if you like the sweeter tasting peas that typically come in cans, these are not for you. On the other hand, if like me you enjoy a hotter wasabi coating, you cannot go wrong with these."

They have a great taste -- crunchy with a taste of sunflower seeds.  Unlike many crackers, they DON'T taste like cardboard; I really look forward to having them with lunch."

It's a great snack and the fact that it's low fat is a big plus. We love the spicy flavor of the wasabi. The cost beats that of our local supermarket by about 10 to 1.<br />As an aside, our dog loves these too, but she's a little odd."

Now I buy boxes of 24 all the time and the vet says they are better to give then a raw hide or some of the treats in the stores .So I think they are ok in my book. Hard to find 1oz ones sometimes but they are worth the price.

Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT."

These breadcrumbs are delicious.  They add extra crunch to my chicken and fish.  They arrived in plastic containers to keep them fresh.  I ordered a case and shared with my friends.  Will definitely order again when I run out.
08	25235,B000FMVOLW,A1H243B6WSTBE,1/13/08,3,3,5,Whole Wheat Panko crumbs (plastic container),"Loving panko crumbs I purchased these in the container.  I believe they were a case of 12.  These were the best crumbs ever.  Nice and crunching when baking chicken and wonderful in the fry pan as well.<br />Sadly the panko crumbs in the plastic container were ""unavailable at this time"" when I last checked.<br />These were really the ones ones I can comment on to be excellent."

08	57913,B000EVOSE4,A1TXUJVXB6KZNR,6/15/08,1,1,3,Haribo Gold Bears 5-pound bag,"It would have been good for me to know the ingredients prior to purchasing. I expected the German-made version which has real fruit extracts. This 5-pound bag is from Hungary and contains artificial and ""natural"" flavors instead. The difference in taste is noticeable, not to mention the obvious advantage for one's health to have something with real fruit rather than something with flavor.<br /><br />On a side note, expect to pay a lot for shipping. There appears to be no land option, airmail only. But, that might depend on whether you live in the same country as the retailer or not.<br />I realized after the purchase that I would save 30-40% by purchasing the small bags at a local store that imports them from Germany."
08	56634,B0012XBD7I,A2LN5DDGT21310,4/23/08,2,5,4,THESE ARE VERY GOOD,"These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier."
08	88686,B000S4HVPU,A325RWA8LHK2QJ,6/14/08,2,2,3,Good but not great,"I like Spaetzle.  They go nicely with many main dishes and are good in basic soups as well.  Bechtle's are cut very small, which makes them less of a plump, cushiony noodle like a true home-made spaetzle might be.  I thinik it is a matter of personal preference, but I tend to prefer a larger, longer noodle.  Noodles are to hold onto gravies and sauces and this one is adequate but not as satisfying as other brands."

The first time I bought them, they were great, I bought two five pound bags, and they were great.  A second order and they were pretty stale.  Some more consistency would be nice...  Might be better to just buy them at your local supermarket or drugstore..."

Now I can give him his pasta dishes and in a regular sized portion, not some dinky serving. Also one of the great things about the Carba Nada Egg Fettuccine is that it's also high in protien.  This is one of the most perfect pastas ever.  I have even started eating it.  I can cook a whole bag, sprinkle it with olive or grape seed oil and refrigerate it and just add sauce or whatever I want to it.  It's good for a few days like this. I am very pleased with the Carba Nada Egg Fettuccine."

It will pull the fillings right out of your head!  And let's face it... if this stuff is a favorite meal, you've got plenty of  fillings. But hey, that makes it an adventure just to eat 'em. Try micro-waving them for about 5 seconds or so and they are softer and a little less chewy. The order arrived in a flash to my door step and ordering was easy."
08	20827,B001EPPYME,AJLIPG8K8O294,12/30/08,9,11,2,"Hot ""Chocolate""?","This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The ""hot chocolate"" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere."

I will have to agree that the packaging and shipping from Amazon leaves a lot to be desired. I have received two shipments on this product. The first shipment was great with little to no crumbling or crushing....as good or better than what I found in my local grocer. The second shipment arrived in very poor condition. The box looked like it had been dropped kicked a couple of times. There is no effort to cushion or protect these biscuits from shipping damage. The six biscuit packages are simply put in the shipping box, and shipped. My first shipment was obviously a lucky shipping experience without need for cushioning, but the second shipment had obviously been mishandled. If you're listening amazon....you need to start using air pillows with this product, and enough of them to actually work. My last experience has left me wary of ordering again without improvements to the shipping packaging.<br /><br />Product = 5 stars<br />packaging = 1 stars"
08	20852,B001EPPCFS,A3P222CN9HAPTF,11/9/08,4,4,5,An English Classic,"""Rich Tea"" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K"">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest ""Rich Tea"", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. ""Rich Tea"" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!"

Not completely taped shut and was possible to reach inside package without disturbing existing tape.  In this day and age that is poor form.  In addition poorly padded inside.  Biscuits broken but packages intact.  Enjoy them so much I ate them anyway.  Glad that they are available widely in the US now.  Will continue to buy biscuits but find different shipper.

I found it excellent---I really liked it. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one. So far, this has been my experience with all of the St. Dalfour's teas that I have tried, a big selling point for me since I enjoy my teas very strongly brewed.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a nice variation on plain black tea. Note that black tea does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****"

All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile."

I ordered the 60 pack and when they arrived I found that the expiration date was only 2 months later.  Either these go bad fast or they were sitting around for a while.
08	44475,B000R7XFDK,APP8XWYYV4PAA,11/15/08,0,0,5,Yummy and somewhat healthy chips,Really like these as a change to potato chips. A bit less fat and healthier in content. Various flavors but I like the original flavor the best as I can taste the ingredients without the linger of additives. An old time favorite for many. Great prices here at Amazon. Also well liked by my Team in the office.

Nuts were tasty and fresh, I freeze the bags until I need the next one.  When including shipping, these are the best value of several sources I have found since Trader Joes stopped selling them."

Received this product in four days. One day earlier than ship date. My only issue was in the packaging. One of the bottles was broken and the inside was just lined with air bubble strips and no indication on the carton of fragile or glass enclosed.
08	42612,B001EQ4E60,A2DBPNK83VEYEV,2/20/08,0,0,5,Good stuff,"Very good product,but you can also buy a generic store brand (same exact ingredients, since the only ingredients in each are tea.)I mix this up, according to directions and add it (1 to 1 ratio) to diet bottled tea when I buy it, since they always put way too much sugar substitute in those for my taste. Really cuts down on that funny aftertaste, too.(But by itself it's good also, you just have to like homemade-type tea, not the chemical-store-bought kind.)"

Spicy and really not that great.  I have no idea where the coconut flavor was in this bar.  I love Indian food, and I love chocolate, but there have got to be better ways to combine the two."

08	20931,B007ZI1ZRC,AAG231B9RSSIN,4/15/08,7,7,4,"Loose 'English Breakfast' style Tea (assam), at a good price","If, like my wife and I, you're blessed with soft tap water, and like a good robust ""English Breakfast Tea"", I've found that this blend (mostly dark assam) is a pretty decent choice, and a good value.  I believe it's packaged by the same company that makes ""PG-Tips"" in the handy pyramid bags.  The quality is comparable.  I generally buy the brooke bond loose for making everyday tea by the pot, and I buy pg tips pyramid bags for travelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I buy the Brooke Bond loose on a regular basis - either online, or at a local indo-pakistani grocer.  I've also bought the Taj Mahal label by the same company, but they appear to be interchangeable, and differ only by the art on the box.  The loose tea is in small granule form, and comes sealed in a foil pouch, for freshness ... it's not flushed with neutral gas, and they dont vaccum pack it because they dont want to crush the tea, but otherwise the quality is pretty decent.  It comes in a variety of sizes, buy the most common size I buy is 900 grams (2 lbs) or 1800 gr (4lbs).<br /><br />The resulting tea is not quite as floral as some assams I've had (hey, it's bulk tea), and there's often a modest amount of tea dust in the bottom of the pouch, but the dust is easily removed by pouring the dry tea into a fine strainer, and tapping the strainer over the garbage (to winnow it), before brewing it.<br /><br />In my household, I generally buy loose tea in bulk, de-dust it, then repackage it in one or more 40 fl oz glass jars using a univeral vaccum sealing lid (see Tilia Food Saver), and then I use those to periodically refill a smaller 16-24 oz convenience container that I keep near my stove, for whenever I want to brew a fresh pot of tea.<br /><br />I've found that 1/4 cup of loose tea is sufficient for a 6 cup pot, and 1/4 - 1/3 cup is sufficient for 8 cups.  After brewing is done (3-5 mins), I pour the brewed tea through a fine tea strainer into serving cups, and the surplus goes into a lidded glass carafe that gets stored in the fridge (after it cools) for subsequent reheating by the cup (re: microwave), or for use in iced tea by the jug (just add some simple syrup and fresh lemon juice to taste, and some optional bruised mint leaves, and you're good to go).<br /><br />Bottom line - for an inexpensive loose bulk tea, this brand is very decent all purpose choice, suitable for both hot and iced tea.  Recommended."

I opened it, and there they all were, loose and floating around inside the box.  The plastic lid on one was broken, and all the other plastic lids were loose.  The only thing keeping the dry tea powder secure was the paper seal at the top of each jar.<br /><br />So, in the end... the product is USABLE, but their care in packing was non-existent, and it's just by luck that the bottles themselves hadn't broken."

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.

You have to boil it for a long time (around 30 minutes) in order to break the outer skin.  The effort returns a very tasty rice which makes eating the usual white rice seem to be a waste of time.  The only small fault is that it is just slightly soggy, but only slightly and this comment should NOT put you off from buying what is GREAT high value-to-price ratio product."

We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality."

Having  lived in Italy for two years, my tastebuds found the 'real deal' and upon returning to the US, I've been searching for something even remotely approaching the velvety luciousness of a good Roman pasta product.  No dice.  Most pasta products I've tried end up a little too gluey/glutinous.  Other than the 'gourmet' brands which can be purchased via Dean & Deluca or similar outlets (for similar, mind-boggling prices) I've had to settle.<br /><br />Not anymore!<br /><br />My fiance' was diagnosed with Type2 diabetes a few years ago.  When we started dating, I began modifying my pantry accordingly, figuring it might not be such a bad idea for me to start watching my carbs as well.  I found Carba Nada while searching for a good pasta, which though low in carbs, might still *hopefully* taste even remotely like pasta, without that 'stewed tennis shoe' taste and texture (Think of Chaplain's famous scene, eating a boiled boot and twirling the shoelaces, a'la Romana).<br /><br />Skepticism turned to stunned disbelief - the taste is amazing, truly a wonderful, slightly egg-flour-y, slightly nutty and naturally buttery.  The texture is perfection, light and springy and never, 'shoe-lacy' chewy.  Top it with a bit of light butter, butter substitute, garlic and romano and you have heaven on Earth.  A bit of light-cream based alfredo sauce and you have pure Heaven.  Partner it full-tilt with your best hearty meat-based sauces and you are in Orbit-Houston-We-Have-Tastebud-Liftoff.<br /><br />Have I made it clear that this is truly GOOD stuff?<br /><br />put the water on, I'll get the cheese grater.<br /><br />Nancy Harding, St. Louis, MO."

If I had to compare it to something it would be steak sauce.  Everytime I want to change a dish up a bit, I use chuno.  I've bought mine from somewhere else and didn't know it came in larger sizes.

When I contacted the seller, they said they ""shared"" a listing with wilderness family naturals. I have been buying from Amazon for years, and have never heard of this practice before. If it was stated up front that this was the company selling the product that would be different. I just thought I should mention this so that any other potential buyers would know what to expect when ordering this."

I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it ""smokey tea"" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of ""softens"" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!"

I haven't been able to find this double black soy sauce since (I worked in Boston) I shopped at the markets in Chinatown on the outskirts of downtown Boston.  The flavor of this soy sauce really makes my dishes, especially my pork lo mein, taste authentic (I guess I mean as it tasted in the restaurant).  Go easy though, the flavor is intense!  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying these wonderful imported treasures."
08	13726,B000AY9U20,A1B05INWIDZ74O,5/15/08,2,3,4,Great Tasting,"Since this seems to be a main concern, I thought I would start with saying that all packages of cookies arrived intact along with a lot of other items I had ordered. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house."
08	88789,B000F409HU,AYB4ELCS5AM8P,3/11/08,7,7,5,Excellent strong tea!,"Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong tea drinker and I love tea, and I've tried all sorts.<br /><br />I started out years ago with Lipton's before all these different designer brands and flavors came along. Black Ceylon tea was what they called it. Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever. I tried different brands, I tried expensive teas, cheap teas, organic teas, the standards such as Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam, etc.<br /><br />Finally, I came back to this tea. It was like travelling around the world in a circle and coming back to the start. I love this tea because I've found all that other stuff, apple, peach, raspberry, just detracts from the true flavor of tea. This tea is just pure tea, without any other distracting flavors and that's what I love about it. A stong tea, a robust tea with full strong flavor, for a man (or a manly woman).<br /><br />When I make it just right, the right temperature, the right strength, this is what I imagine Homer's nectar of the gods to be like. It's like Zeus brews me a cup, hands it over and says ""here, drink this"".<br /><br />So far I have not been able to find another unadulterated tea with such a full and strong flavor. A 10/10."

And Reese's Pieces are so good that M&Ms stole the idea back - and doesn't do peanut butter anywhere near as well as Reese's!  Like M&Ms, Reese's Pieces are little dots with a candy-coating; inside is a creamy peanut butter.  They don't compare with M&Ms Plain, but they beat the peanut butter out of M&Ms Peanut Butter!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks"

Once brewed, the tea is a deep red color and rosy tasting.  It makes for a mellow cup of tea and is easy drinking and light in caffeine.  You can enjoy a whole pot full here and this makes it great company with a long novel.  Definitely not a bracing breakfast style tea if that's what you're looking for but if you like subtle aromatic teas, this is a sure bet.  Doesn't get bitter even with oversteeping.  A real pleasure.  If you like this, try lychee congou if you can track it down.  Very aromatic and mellow as well."

08	11044,B0000VYKXC,A1OQ5YU9CA5WZO,3/28/08,1,1,4,Very interesting blend,"I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.<br /><br />Out of the bag, the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule . Even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket, the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air, the aroma starts to leak. Grind your beans moments before you put it to use, you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it."
08	35111,B000HQQU4C,A13G6C2JUGLE90,4/6/08,6,10,1,YOU DO NOT GET WHAT IS SHOWN,I ordered this Salada DECAF White/Green Tea Blend because I had tried it somewhere and loved the taste.  I looked in many stores but could not find it.  Everyone had Decaf Green and Decaf White but nobody had the blend of both.  I was SO HAPPY when I found it shown and listed on amazon so I was thrilled to order the case of 6 boxes.  It arrived a week later only to be 6 boxes of the Decaf WHITE Tea and NOT the blend as advertised on this website.  BE careful ordering this most likely you will NOT get what you ordered.

08	88790,B000F409HU,A2AMCXMOE48X47,11/9/08,4,4,5,The perfect cup of tea,"When  I could no longer drink coffee  ( I loved it but it stopped loving me at age 50, making my nerves too jangly and insomniac for comfort) my favorite advisor about coffee and tea suggested I try Taylor of Harrogate""s Kwazulu Tea from South Africa.  Enough caffeine to keep a busy evening nurse clear and running at San Francisco General Hospital, but no frazzled nerves, and deep sleep like a baby restorative rest once off duty.  i love the clean, slightly bitter taste it gives to my palate; other black teas taste insipid by comparison.  If you like English or Irish Breakfast Teas, you'll find Kwazulu Tea a magnificent improvement and frankly, never want to settle for anything less.  It's sometimes a little difficult to find, but like the search for the Holy Grail, worth the pursuit.  Shop around on the internet for the best price since there can be overpricing.<br />A sante, as Julia Child always signed off."
08	88793,B000F409HU,A1314GEXYKM385,6/25/08,3,4,5,Yummy!,"This is an excellent black tea. My preference in black teas runs toward those that are smooth and not at all bitter. This means I often end up with  somewhat blander brews with little to distinguish them. This Ntingwe Kwazulu is a great exception to that experience. It's quite brisk, has robust flavor and yet is very smooth with no bitterness. My only complaint is the powder residue in the bottom of the cup, but it's well worth it. Now my favorite black tea!"
08	11045,B0000VYKXC,A1QGWT5ERDNDNU,3/8/08,1,1,4,My favorite Starbucks variety,"First of all, in response to the query of why you would order this online posed by the reviewer below...not everyone lives near a Starbucks. Hard to believe I know, considering they seem to be on every street corner, but believe it or not there are still large sections of the US w/out Starbucks. So for those of us who want good coffee, Thank God for the internet & amazon. Verona is my favorite SB blend. It doesn't taste burnt as some of their coffee does to me. It has a boldness without being too dark & overwhelming, and it has subtle notes of chocolate without the icky sweetness of a flavored coffee. It makes a delicious cup of coffee."

I was blown away at how good they were and bought two bags. I don't live close to Costco and now wish I bought more when I was up there. You have to try these chips they are so good. They are not too salty and they are very crispy. They are a little corny as well as a little grainy and naturally slightly sweet. Very best chips I've had, great with guacamole and hummus or just plain. They are worth my 3 hour drive to Costco!!!"
08	88797,B000F409HU,A1ERBEA2SY5T77,6/12/08,1,2,3,Okay taste but cut fine for a loose tea,Much smaller cut than other premium teas I have bought. Taste is okay - you will need a fine mesh filter.

My biggest complaint though was how several of the bags (I think it was 4) popped open during shipping and I ended up throwing them out since I didn't want to use a product from an opened bag.  If they had a better way to ship these they might be worth buying again but as for me, I'm going to try to find another whole wheat egg noodle."

Vruit's Orange Veggie Blend is a surprising exception.<br /><br />Falling into the newly-popular vegetable drinks that taste fruity, Vruit is a bit overpriced on the store shelves for what it is, particularly since it's not alone on that shelf.  Amazon's price is quite good, and with free shipping, you can't go wrong.  Vruit loses points from me, though, because - as an all natural product whose largest consumer base is likely to be the organic, save-the-planet crowd - it bothers me that the stuff comes in single-serving juice boxes instead of a less-packaging, more-eco-friendly recyclable bottle.<br /><br />The Orange Veggie Blend actually reminds me of an apricot juice, although a bit more tart.  There isn't exactly an after-taste, but there is an after-effect, in that my mouth feels a bit puckered and strangely dry after I drink one.  Healthy?  Yes.  Tasty?  Surprisingly, yes.  Thirst-quenching?  Not really.  A glass of cold water goes further and doesn't require me to sip from a tiny straw like a toddler.  I won't be buying these any time soon, but I'll still recommend them to others!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks"
08	27520,B000FD9364,AMY2VJUYKBCGH,6/24/08,0,0,5,DaVinci Whole Wheat Penne Pasta -- The Perfect WW Pasta,"As part of my healthy eating plan, I gave up eating anything made from processed flour.  Bread and cereal weren't a problem -- lots of good whole grain alternatives available -- but great whole wheat pasta has been elusive. My main complaints: its general mushiness, even when cooked according to direction; and its bland texture.<br />The DaVinci brand, most notably the penne, is my new favorite.  It has a rich taste and a nice texture, and it seems to resist the mushies, particularly if you cook it al dente.  Delicious.<br /><br />And best of all: Amazon delivers a case of it to my door every three months."

A Japanese friend got me hooked on these noodles.  Better quality than run of the mill ramen, sauce flavor and seaweed great too.  I don't use quite the whole envelope of the sauce mix when tossing on the noodles."
08	12608,B000EW0XFQ,AE23TVGWVLJIX,10/22/08,2,3,2,My kids don't like it,I bought this cereal for my kids (ages 6 and 7) who can't eat gluten any more.  They won't eat it.  I think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out.

I love this Tea, drink it twice a day. When I wake in the morning and again in the afternoon. This is my third purchase through Amazon."
08	74188,B000I4H2GS,A281NPSIMI1C2R,5/15/08,3,3,5,A Daily Pleasure,"This tea is a true English luxury, but once you taste it, it is difficult to be satisfied with less than the finest tea this company makes. Yorkshire Gold tea has more flavor and character than most teas.<br /><br />The secret seems to be in the high quality of the teas selected for Yorkshire Gold and in the shape of the tea bag which allows for the tea leaves to spread out more and I think this enhances the ability for a full tea flavor to develop.<br /><br />This tea blend is perfect to steep along with a cinnamon stick. It is strong enough to serve with whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg.<br /><br />The art on the box was painted by Lizzie Sanders and it sets a nice English mood for your tea drinking experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
08	64073,B000O7V3QO,A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,1/23/08,12,13,5,"GREAT coffee, misleading price","One of our faves, very smooth and easy on the acidity without being bland, HOWEVER, the Tassimo retail is 7.99 each. Where is Amazon getting the inflated 'retail' price? Retail for a Pack of 2 is only $16, NOT $20. They do this on every T-Disc."
08	64074,B000O7V3QO,A5EYTESWV1F3U,1/22/08,6,6,5,Great Big Good Tasting Cup of Coffee,"I believe this is the best choice of any coffees used with the Tassimo.  It not only has a good taste, but it give you a large normal mug size cup of fresh brewed coffee.  The other Gevalia coffees are great (well, not the decaf), but they're too small.  I was using 2 for each cup of coffe.  This product has both."

08	286,B000H13270,A1YLOZQKBX3J1S,9/11/08,1,4,3,too expensive,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however, it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.<br /><br />as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
08	64084,B000O7V3QO,A13FTRLCLTSMHN,7/10/08,1,1,5,Love the larger cup size!,"I love, love, love that this pours a 12 oz. cup vs. the standard 9 oz. cup.  The coffee itself is a bit on the weak side for my taste, but I love a super strong brew.  That said, I would get this again just for the 12 oz. pour.  My husband who prefers a slightly less strong brew than me, really enjoys this coffee."
08	64085,B000O7V3QO,A2QPHTI3DWVNNI,4/10/08,1,1,3,Gevalia,"I love my Tassimo coffee maker, but this is not one of my favorite brands. I've tried it and I will buy again when the price is right, but I think the taste is a little ""thin"" compared to other brands I've tried."
08	44516,B000NMK0EQ,AAMLBV5VJLC5D,7/5/08,1,1,4,Good choice for a lunch:-),It's not delicious but tastes better and healthier than other meal replacement bars. The cleansing effect is amazing probably because of fiber. I did replace my lunch with 2 bars and it worked great. I combine usually ReBar with Choco Raspberry bars from Garden Of Life :-)
08	64086,B000O7V3QO,ALVO6G996LVAU,12/11/08,3,4,1,"Too Big For a Mug, Not Big Enough Flavor","The Gevalia Morning Roast fills a coffee cup to the top so that there is no room for creamer.  I could forgive that and use a larger mug but what I can't forgive is the lack of flavor.  It's listed as ""medium"" but I find it weak and tasteless.  Full disclosure: I like bold coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE:  If you find yourself with a box of this coffee, here is a workaround for lack of flavor.  Turn off your machine when the coffee level is at the level of a normal 11 oz. cup of coffee.  You will find something to taste when you leave out the rest of the water."
08	64102,B000O7V3QO,A26SIHDRJ16Q2M,10/6/08,1,2,5,Tassimo Coffee,Pleased with the product and the ease with which it was ordered.  Shipping time was really great.

Now that I have this appliance, I wouldn't want to be without it. Looking forward to trying various types of coffee."
08	18263,B000SATIGO,A2NXPEVPFAYN1Z,1/21/08,22,22,5,Purely Assam,"A good rich, malty, bready assam that can stand up to milk & sugar.  As usual don't over steep an Assam.  Wonderful value for fair trade organic!"
08	64111,B000LKZHWK,A2V167N24KJ2ZN,9/14/08,2,2,5,Top-quality extracts,"The flavor and scent of Simply Organic's flavoring is strong and true.  It is really a light oil extract, so it also seems to have a much longer shelf-life. Considering that the price rivals many of the artificial extracts on the market--yet is clearly better quality--I find it to be a superb value.<br /><br />I love this whole line of extracts, and specifically the lemon extract.  I use it for both baking/cooking purposes (I often replace or supplement vanilla with lemon, as the two flavors really seem to enhance the overall product), as well as to make organic concoctions.<br /><br />One example: I love the smell of Bigelow's Lemon Body Lotion as well as Tutti-Dulce's Lemon Merengue line, but they are pricey. I find it's more cost-effective for me to just buy an inexpensive vanilla-scented body cream, melt it down in the microwave, mix in some of this extract, and when it re-sets it smells just like the expensive stuff!<br /><br />I am also going to try a new toning mask of witchhazel and the lemon extract, which is supposed to help clarify and minimize pores.  Considering the low cost and high-quality of this product, I find myself looking for all sorts of ways to use it."
08	28740,B00061EOHI,A30X750M8V1XXW,6/6/08,2,5,1,"Small popcorn, not so great","I'm a big popcorn fan and have tried many brands. I tried this one because the best, BKH popcorn has gone out of business. I like the hullless kind and they not only had the best but the largest popped kernels. In addition to that on the average 99% popped. The Black Jewel had like 25% not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn. The popped kernels were very small, hardly nothing to eat. The flavor was good but certainly not worth ever buying again. If anyone knows the BKH brand and can suggest one like it let me know."
08	44518,B000NMK0EQ,A1JM106QIZ4HL4,11/2/08,0,0,5,Rebar,Love these organic Rebar when I can't have all my daily fruits and veggies. The order was accurate and delivered fast.
08	46054,B001EO5QZK,A1B54NV7RNRBO4,1/5/08,4,4,5,My favorite!,"I've started each morning off with this particular tea for the last 5 or 6 years. I love this tea. I went from a coffee drinker to a green tea drinker because of this tea. It has nice a strong flavor that I simply adore. (I make it much stronger then suggested, I love bitter tastes! Then I just add hot water to the leaves for the second cup, and it is as good as the first!) I have been purchasing this from Stash directly for years, but it is a better deal on Amazon."
08	64119,B000WJRBXS,A1RLXNOFS1GBKB,12/7/08,1,2,5,Oh wow! Love it!,"Holy cow this stuff is amazing. How can they even call it tea?  Tea is that boring, flavored water stuff.  This stuff?  Nothing close to boring.  My sister gave me some to try and I can't get over how good it is.  It's like eating some kind of sinfully, delicious dessert, only without all the bad, empty calories.  I add honey to it, but really- you don't even need to add a sweetener.  It can stand alone.  This has the most heavenly aroma too.  But if you're only so-so on cinnamon- BEWARE.  This has intoxicating amounts of cinnamon.  Delicious!  Now, where can I get some more..."
08	64121,B001E6EJX8,A2V3FTILDQEOX6,2/29/08,5,5,5,we love these bars,These bars in the peanut/chocolate or the chocolate chip are the best!  They fill me up have good fiber and protein content.  Whenever I can get a good deal at Amazon I stock up!
08	64122,B001E6EJX8,A211LARF9RT41K,3/8/08,6,7,5,"good product, satisfies my hunger :)","I already wrote a review for the chocolate chip ones, though I thought I was writing it for this flavor, so I will just copy and paste. THe both taste good.<br /><br />I bought these bars as a meal replacement, since I am usually hungry about 4 hours after I had lunch, or 2-3 hours after breakfast, so I have to survive before the next meal. This does the job well. I can stay without eating for another 2-3 hours. It also depends how much water you drink, sometimes all you need is water to get rid of the ""hunger"". It's the way your body tells you you need water as well.<br /><br />My stomach is somewhat sensible and doesn't like a lot of stuff, but these bars never bother me.<br /><br />I also think they are tasty, but only the chocolate ones. I tried the strawberry ones, but they are too creamy. I also liked the chocolate chip ones, they both taste similar, though the chocolate chip ones have more fiber than these ones :P"
08	64126,B001E6EJX8,A22ENBS081LY6C,4/25/08,3,3,4,Much better than Nutrisystem,"Much better than Nutrisystem. I bought the Nutrisystem plan for 8 weeks, less than half the food was edible, comparing this to their breakfast bar this is by far better tasting and it does make you feel full longer."
08	1211,B005O072PC,A4BUVWK8SXR7Z,3/25/08,9,10,1,Not like the picture,Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn't look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did!
08	488,B000G6RYNE,A1WQ3UGXPT15VI,6/19/08,0,0,2,Not  Very Creamy or Chivey...,"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
08	44519,B000NMK0EQ,A2HZ3TTL9HE4KL,8/8/08,0,0,5,best health bar without the sugar or soy,"I've been enjoying ReBar for years.  As a vegan looking for a a low fat snack bar, this is the best.  Better than just having some dried fruit because it has Veggies also!  You get greens, veggies, and fruit packed into one bar.  I often roll a bar in some granola or nuts to give it a bit more built.  Great for some energy without the sugar and soy or milk proteins found in other bars. Taste is very nice, as it's not too sweet like date bars, but it doesn't have that odd grassy taste of pure wheat grass juice."
08	44520,B000NMK0EQ,A8IW8LPW286XF,7/13/08,0,0,5,Great snack!,"I eat these bars almost daily. They taste great, and I don't notice the odor that another reviewer mentions. My husband is a bit of a picky eater who doesn't avoid sugar or make an effort to get plenty of veggies like I do. He really likes them too. They're great as an energy bar during or after a long workout, as a snack or part of a lunch. 160 calories isn't bad. And I love that they taste great and help me get my daily veggie servings. Finally, they don't mess up my blood sugar like the date-based bars tend to do."
08	14322,B001CWV4PA,A3TTWX987E3NM5,12/8/08,4,6,3,Broken Crackers A Problem,I purchased these crackers from a local store for my 9 yr. old daughter who has celiac disease. She loves them but so many crackers were broken that they were mostly unusable for anything other than a bowl of pieces to snack on. I could only get about 3 cracker sandwiches out of the entire box. Glutino needs to fix this problem asap.
08	64141,B001E6EJX8,AJ6OHB412JP03,8/3/08,1,1,5,These are awesome!,"So, in my long search for meal bars, I have tried any I have ever seen on the shelves. My general reaction to most of them is that they are like eating cardboard. Also, the ""flavor"" that most claim to have is not there. So, from childhood I loved double chocolate granola bars. Not healthy at all, but I was a kid. I saw these on the shelf, and decided to try them, despite the many other double chocolate bars I had tried recently. To my surprise, these taste amazing. Has a very chocolaty taste, with no awful after-taste. Also, eating them is just like eating my granola bars I remember...except these are much better for you.<br /><br />I of course don't promote these to people who are on diets that need to watch more than calories, as the fat content and sugars may be a little high for many people. But I can tell you I am male, 5'11"", and weigh about 180. This bar with a piece of fruit will keep me full for my entire 5 hour morning."
08	64142,B001E6EJX8,A17YYG33CPGZN5,4/13/08,1,1,5,The best way to lose weight!,I absolutely love these bars!  They are better than any candy bar I have ever tried!  Super!  At only 180 calories- it's a better than any other  chocalate fix I've tried!
08	48125,B004SRH2B6,A3BCHM0TQ8M7SO,8/29/08,0,0,5,Delicious!,"I love Zico after a hard workout (or before if I haven't eaten).  It immediately re-energizes me, and best of all, it tastes great!"
08	48126,B004SRH2B6,A1L98BSHXY0HCY,8/15/08,0,0,5,Absolutely the Best!,This is my favorite of all the coconut waters available.  Love the mango flavor.  I drink after I do Bikram yoga and it's something I look forward to  having.
08	64159,B001E6EJX8,AA8SEVISJIYDH,6/21/08,0,0,5,Satisfying and Delicious,Kellogg's Special K Protein Meal Bars are amazing.  I love the chocolatey taste of the Double Chocolate flavor.  But perhaps the strongest recommendation for this product is how satisfied I am for many hours after eating one.  And it feels good to know I have had a  dose of protein even thought I did not go to the trouble of cooking a meal.
