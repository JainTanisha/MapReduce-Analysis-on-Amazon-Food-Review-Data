I don't usually drink flavored coffees because they tend to taste sort of ""fake"" or chemically, but I decided to try Aloha Island's French Vanilla coffee after I tried their French Vanilla Pods in my Senseo Machine.  My mother-in-law is still living in the ""dark ages"" and still uses a drip brewer, so I took this coffee over to her house this past weekend.  Everybody loved the coffee (we have a big family)!  My mother-in-law was so happy that we finally brought her something she can use and that she likes.  I'm just happy that we no longer have to drink the bad coffee she usually brews!  I'm an Aloha Island convert - we've been spoiled and now we can't drink anything else!"

The packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn't help when giving as gifts.  Saved 2 packages for our family Christmas Eve treats. I can't say they are horrible but it tasted like any old chocolate shake.  It has a very strong chocolate taste so I added more milk to tame the taste.  These are pretty exprensive so we expected better.

Please see my review for the Neo canned diet for a lengthier review -- it all applies to this Dry Neo food too.  My older dogs who have had kidney disease have had teeth pulled by the vet.  The Dry Neo diet has small chunks & is easy to eat.  All my dogs like the flavor & have not refused the food - ever.  Because the chunks are small, they are easy to moisten with water for the dogs who need to *gum* their meals. I have to take a city bus to get to my vet now.  Ordering my Hi-Tor foods thru Amazon & having it come to my door has been a God send.  It is less expensive than what I get from the vet, I can buy it whenever I want, & it comes right to my door!!  Hi-Tor has done a great job for years supplying pet owners with Special Diets.  I have told all my friends about them & heartily recommend them."

Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan. When you look at it like that, I believe it's one of the best values in pet nutrition on the market today."

05	42341,B0002IF5CI,A2WAIECY8JGQAI,11/8/05,26,29,5,A Beacon for Bacon,"Neuske's Bacon is simply the most divine bacon eating experience you'll ever have.  Smoked in Wisconsin over applewood, it is delectable, luscious even.  They cut it lean so that there is no rubbery, fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands, yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor.  It is worth noting that America's Test Kitchen did a Taste Test of Bacon, in which Neuske's was a participant.  It did NOT come out as No.1, because tasters thought it was ""too smoky"".  If you like smoky bacon like I do, that sounds like crazy talk, and you should definitely try this bacon.  The results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky, and I suppose that if you are one of those people, you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever).<br /><br />Be careful though: once you eat Neuske's and love it, you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again!"

05	39507,B00028P3CK,A26HFSVLAGULIM,11/19/05,12,14,5,SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND,"EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This ""NOW Stevia powder"" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% ""steviocides"" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, ""The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook"".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This ""NOW"" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. ""Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz."" is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. ""Swanson"" and ""Nature's Way"" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"

It's not the flakes like we're used to. It's little nuggets, steel cut, that take a little while to cook but it's well worth the extra time. It's creamy and nutty and tastes wonderful with bananas and raisins and brown sugar. I highly recommend giving this product a try!<br /><br />(If you put the oatmeal in with the water to start and let it come to a boil and then turn it down to simmer it doesn't take quite as long.)"

I put the tablet in the blender and pulverize it (do one at a time, otherwise they melt).

By far this system witht the senseo pods, makes the best cup of coffee that I have ever had at home. I find myself hording the genuine pods for myself and special guests. My Other guests are served turkish ground Starbucks coffee in an adaptor.<br /><br />The difference between the genuine pods and the others is the amount of froth that is generateed and the smoothness of the coffee.  to date, all of the other brands that I have tried (Java pods and Maxwell house) leave less than a 1/2"" of froth and an after taste/sour note.<br /><br />I like these pods as they impart a lovely vanilla note that is slightly nutty. The froth is about 3/4"" thick.  Typically I use 2 pods and create the large amount of coffee. 2 vanilla bistro pods have the stregth of 2 mild regular pods. This makes for a lovely middle of the day coffee but does not have the needed early morning kick/strength."

So much better than non-organic chocolate.  You open the wrapper and the chocolate smells divine! The colour is a lovely dark chocolate brown.  And when you snap a piece off, it breaks off well.  Then, you put it in your mouth.  Oh my!  I need some more!  The best chocolate I have tasted - ever! Go on, just buy some!"

Every now and then I need a different kick from my coffee and until now it wasn't a possibility.<br /><br />The Vanilla Bistro variety doesn't necessarily provide a kick, but its vanilla flavor does provide an occasional welcome switch from the monotony of black coffee.

The dark chocolate is not bitter like many chocolatiers - it has the perfect blend of taste for any chocoholic.  I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and can guarantee - Leonidas is the ""Mercedes-Benz"" of chocolatiers.  The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate.  If you love dark chocolate then go for the dark chocolate assortment.  You will not regret it.  Also forget Godiva - it's medium grade quality."

I originally bought it for a mocha dessert recipe in the South Beach Diet book. I tried it to make a latte and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't expected much from instant espresso based on past experience with instant coffees. This is actually very good. I have only used it for lattes and mochas. I don't do espresso by the shot. I particularly like it when I go camping. I've shared it with fellow campers who also liked it. The flavor is rich and can be adjusted to taste by varying the amount per cup. It also has a light froth on top. I recommend it highly."

These will certainly clear your sinuses, but quality is poor.  These would best be described as one part tiny, stale peanut and four parts crunchy wasabi coating dumped into 2 one pound bags.  Learn from my mistake: pay a little more and get less for higher quality in a tin.<br /><br />On a positive note, the vendor was prompt with the shipping.  Their other products are probably good, but this one is not."

I first tried it in a very nice sushi restaurant, and then again in a less-fancy one. A few months later, I discovered that Price Chopper sells these exact packets (they're a bit more expensive there than here on Amazon).<br /><br />Miso soup is hard to describe. I think of it as having a taste that you kind of have to acquire...It took me a few bowls to really get used to it. But once you do, it's great! I suggest this for anyone who's interested in Japanese culture and food."
05	51341,B0014UAHQM,A26HFSVLAGULIM,11/19/05,12,14,5,SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND,"EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This ""NOW Stevia powder"" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% ""steviocides"" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, ""The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook"".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This ""NOW"" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. ""Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz."" is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. ""Swanson"" and ""Nature's Way"" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"

05	9839,B0007OVXLO,A6GMEO3VRY51S,8/12/05,1,1,5,Slurp,"I was crazy about these as a kid! They are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it. I first tried their cute little wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these now. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But there are also the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 48 packs of 3 tubes each in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Willy Wonka factory."
05	8812,B00060PTLO,AKXLOUG2VFVPN,9/14/05,23,23,5,Low-cost Latte,Medaglia D'Oro Instant Espresso Coffee is by far the best way to make a latte in the comfort of your home and it's also the cheapest!  I use it to make an awesome vanilla latte - just put two (2) spoonfuls of the Medaglia D'Oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix.  Place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass(more or less according to individual taste). Next add enough cubed [not crushed]ice to fill the glass 2/3rds of the way up.  Then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice.  Pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed.  Add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color.  Delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands (once you have the ingredients on hand).  Medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso.  Not all stores carry this product so I order from Gristedes through Amazon.com.

One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center, and as you chew the orange flavor spreads throughout your mouth.  Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.  For an alternative to the sweeter cookies typically available in the cookie isle, try Pepperidge Farm's cookies.  If you are looking for a good cookie to try first, this one is a winner."

However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup. After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button. This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers. It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great. Each pod is foil wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time"

The really good kind that makes you glad the cups are small, and the not-so-good kind that makes you long for the kind your mother used to make.  This pudding falls in the second category.  This pudding is okay on an occasional basis, but the chocolate flavor seems a little off.  It is difficult to describe what I mean, but the flavor just does not quite have the power of home-made chocolate pudding.<br /><br />I have tasted a number of other pre-made puddings, and several of them are very good.  The vanilla and the tapioca are generally very good to excellent.  The lemon is also very good.  However, the chocolate seems to fall short in tast quality, and while I will eat it occasionally, if you have a choice between home-made and this one, choose the home made."

I basically eat them as a meal supplement. I look for bars that taste good, are low in saturated fat, high in fiber, high in protein, and low in things like corn syrup and sodium. The Larabar product meets all these criteria. They are kind of unusual in their consistency though whic hmay turn some people off. They are quite dense in consistency, and some flavors also have a ""sticky"" consistency. The flavors are potent fresh and generally good. They taste like they are really made of the ""flavor"" on the label. Cherry taste like an actual cherry.

Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.<br /><br />I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.<br /><br />The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.

The delicate snap of the chocolate when you take the first bite, the smooth melting of delicious fine chocolate as you only feel the smoothest of chocolate melting on your tongue in a buttery bliss. These are not bitter or overly sour, as you would expect from a dark chocolate.<br /><br />The taste is more refined and the chocolate is made from the premium cocoa beans found on the island of Sao Tome. This distinctive flavor is a rare bliss for chocolate connoisseurs who wish to taste a pure chocolate without any flavorings or fillers. This is just pure, pure chocolate made with 72 % cocoa, sugar, cocoa butter and soya lecithin.<br /><br />I prefer to savor each piece of chocolate with a cup of tea or coffee. The warmth of the beverage creates an entirely different experience than if you were to simply taste a square of chocolate on its own. Once your mouth is warmed, take a small bite of the chocolate square and enter Chocolate Oblivion where each nuance becomes a journey into pleasure.<br /><br />The world stops for minutes at a time as you savor a mingling of the silkiest chocolate you have ever tasted. If there is a better chocolate, I haven't tasted it. Such perfection! These are chocolates you must eat slowly, letting them melt in your mouth as the superior richness fills your mouth with chocolate bliss.<br /><br />You can also melt 8 squares into 11 ounces of milk to make hot chocolate or you can take pleasure in the superior flavor of one piece of chocolate as a delectable luxury.<br /><br />The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold ballotin with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping.<br /><br />The Orange and Cinnamon varieties contain natural cinnamon and orange flavorings. The Cinnamon Napolitains or squares have a unique cinnamon flavor that is especially delicious. If you wish to try all the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties.<br /><br />While I am in love with the quality of Leonidas chocolates, the customer service and shipping speed is equally impressive. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />Leonidas chocolates are a thoughtful gift for friends or you may just want to order them for your own chocolate pleasure. I can guarantee that once you taste these chocolates, you will never be fully satisfied by less than the best. When you long for the purity of chocolate in its most refined state, then these are the chocolates to order!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.<br /><br />In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity.

When I do have a steak, though, I absolutely love the taste of A1, which brings out the best in any cut of meat. Although I am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood (which the label suggests as a good idea), I think it goes well with any kind of beef, and works well on chicken and turkey as well. It is an essential ingredient in many marinades, and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator.<br /><br />What many people don't realize is the long and noble history of A1, which dates to 1824. In 1824, when a king's palate reigned supreme, Henderson William Brand, chef to England's King George IV, created a sauce for King George for use on meats. King George was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it ""A1,"" and that's how the sauce got its name.<br /><br />Beyond the history lesson, though, I think King George was correct in his gustatory proclamation: this sauce really is ""A1""!"

05	55285,B008Z4VAPM,A2A46BUQRGSAB0,12/13/05,17,18,5,Once acquired...This (satisfying!) miso soup might be your new addiction.,"I first picked this off the shelf at a military commissary in Kansas one summer... and I never stopped. The first time you try this stuff, it's like wine or avocados; it's a taste that is certainly acquired, and like nothing else. I have fed it to a friend and to my significant other; few like it the first time, but you find yourself strangely coming back for more until it's a staple in your house, like it is in mine. Kind of reminds me of sushi; first time I tried it, I was like, ""this is odd, why do people eat this?"", then, I found myself craving it a week later. Haha. Now I love sushi and miso! (By the way, it comes in an envelope with 3 individual packets). Mix it in hot water, to taste. You might like it with more or less water, depending on how salty you like your food. -Experiment with it to your satisfaction, and I guarantee, there is much of that to be had.<br /><br />I usually add all 3 little individual packets (it's low-fat) to a decent-sized cup of hot water, add my favorite vinegar, and let it sit and ""cure"" for a minute or so, since the little green sea-vegetable flakes (and green onions + tofu squares) need time to rehydrate and turn a little chewy and palatable. I then sip it and fish the sea vegetables out to my heart's content.<br /><br />(I also hear that miso can be generally healthy for you!)<br /><br />If you let it sit, the miso will start to separate from the rest of the soup and you have delightful little clouds of miso particles floating in your bowl, which is sort of entertaining and visually delightful, too. I think of it as cheap, delicious entertainment. But then again, I am easily amused. ;)"

Other merchants like Podhead charge anywhere from $0.42 and up plus shipping.  This sampler contains some exclusive pods that retail for much more making this a decent deal afterall.  However, don't be fooled into thinking you'll really want to drink $2.00 pods on a daily basis. [...] and they have free shipping on $75 or more orders.  Most are less than $0.50/pod if you buy a quantity worthy of a casual espresso drinker."

One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center, and as you chew the orange flavor spreads throughout your mouth.  Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.  For an alternative to the sweeter cookies typically available in the cookie isle, try Pepperidge Farm's cookies.  If you are looking for a good cookie to try first, this one is a winner."

As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting.<br /><br />I tried the ""banana cookie dough"" flavor, since I'm a banana nut.  Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives.  Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it.  It looked moist and smelled phenomenal.  The first bite made me think ""banana bread"", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a ""cookie"", in any case.  The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds.  The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively.  The #4 ingredient was.... nothing.  There are only 3 ingredients.  I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list!<br /><br />These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.  Its simply incredible, and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out, too."

05	16178,B0001BVD04,A6GMEO3VRY51S,7/25/05,8,8,5,Best cherry soda I have ever had,"Another delicious old fashioned Boylan Bottleworks flavor of soda. I say old fashioned because they are a 100 year plus company that makes their sodas the way that everyone made them before they changed all the ingrediants in the 1970's. Their Black Cherry's deep flavor comes from a blend of different cherries along with other high class ingredients here. This is the only cherry soda I know that uses only a mix of pure natural black cherries for the flavor, no other fruit juices or artificial flavors mixed in to save money. As a result the cherry really does taste like cherry rather than a syrupy mess that has a hint of cherry. It has an authentic tart cherry mixed in the sweet, and you can taste the tart in the aftertaste. It even has a nice texture in the mouth. I know this sounds gushy but you have to try it!<br /><br />But it gets better, they used real cane sugar instead of the cheaper high fructose corn syrup that is used in all the big brand sodas. As a result the sweet is more clean, not as overpowering or syrupy. The carbonation is medium, again here is an issue of too much carbonation can detract from the flavor. Caffeine free. The bottle is very cool and nostalgic with a painted on label and raised letters on the glass, reminding you they have been in business since 1891. All in all a perfect black cherry soda, best I have ever had."

I remembered back in '95, Orangina bottles sold from Terner's Liquor had the exact shape and size like Clearly Canadians'(16oz?), after a while I couldn't find it anymore. I searched everywhere, including places like BevMo, zilch! All of a sudden it emerged out of nowhere in the form of slightly smaller ""bulby"" bottles. There is just something about this beverage, that I'll never forget the taste of it, the lightly carbonated juice stings your tongue and not too sweet. It was and still very unique and refreshing. I have not been able to locate this drink for about 10 years and was lingering in my mind from time to time every time when I passed by the L.A. area.....until now, thanks to Trader Joe's I stock 'em up chilled!"

It goes in salad, on pasta, on veggies and meats, in soups.  Ok, I never used it in a dessert recipe!  I backpacked up the east coast of Australia once for two months.  My Cavender's was the only thing I made sure was in my pack...the jumbo size.  I've introduced more people to this seasoning; it is the ""secret ingredient"" to some of my most popular recipes.<br /><br />Lately, I've been making ""simple salad"" - torn bibb lettuce leaves, olive oil, Cavender's, a little grated parmesan, a little balsamic vinegar.

05	69951,B00032BG3K,A26HFSVLAGULIM,9/16/05,13,14,5,DID I FORGET TO MENTION? -- IT TASTES GOOD TOO!!!,"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available. Sometimes the 20-ounce size is out of stock or absent from store shelves so check first."

Indeed, the delicacy is so extraordinary that Mark Twain named his most famous character after it. And why not? People who know about wild Huckleberries tend to be very passionate about them. Evocative of summer sunlight, mountainsides, mysterious woods, and images of children berry hunting. The huckleberry bushes' small oval leaves, the blue-black berries, perfectly round, each with an intense flavor, a unique tartness and crunch.<br /><br />This uncultivated cousin of the blueberry, grows only in the wild at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. Twelve species of huckleberries are native to Washington and Oregon. They also grow wild in the Rocky Mountains. However varied the berry, the season is short: late July through mid-September. Because they are hard to find, they tend to be expensive. But huckleberry lovers swoon over the thick skin and wild flavor that no other berry captures as well. As far as I am concerned, these berries, food of the god's, are worth every penny.<br /><br />Huckleberry Haven's Wild Huckleberry Jam perfectly captures the pure, natural taste of this most elite of berries. Buy one jar and you will be back to buy an entire case. I spread the jam on toast, muffins, scones, French Toast, occasionally even on pancakes - much better than syrup, and as another reviewer wrote, this is the best jam to accompany peanut butter. I hope you try this product. I always have a jar in the fridge. ENJOY!!<br /><br />JANA"

Lighter, Sweeter, & Refreshingly Fizzy.","I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze describes their sodas as ""100% Pure Fruit Juice and Sparkling Water"". That's an exaggeration, as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks. But the description is apt in that Izze's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas. They are lightly carbonated, not super-fizzy. And the best of them taste like fresh fruit. The Sparkling Grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans, because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice, but lighter and a little sweeter. It's a little tart. A little sweet. A little fizzy. Very refreshing. It's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice, only better. There's never any trace of sourness. No refined sugar, artificial ingredients, or caffeine either. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.<br /><br />Ingredients: sparkling water, grape juice concentrate, grape fruit juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum acacia (from acacia trees), ester gum, red cabbage extract (color).

A friend of mine introduced me to this drink based on his own childhood remembrance in the Midwest. I don't recall it from mine, but once I tasted it, it did take me back to the days when miniature plastic bottles of Hawaiian Fruit Punch stood next to my mother's jell-o mold in the refrigerator.<br /><br />With the appropriate color-clashing, tropical d&eacute;cor on the can, Tahitian Treat is tasty in that fizzy, retro sort of way and is definitely not for the macrobiotic among us, as there are standard, life-shortening ingredients like sodium benzoate and Red #40 pervading the carbonation. And you certainly can't drink it like Diet Coke since it is an astonishing 200 calories a can. But baby boomers should have a stash when they feel like a walk down a sugar-infested memory lane. Be forewarned that Amazon may be the only option to get this soft drink since it is not easily found at stores as specialized as Beverages and More, at least here in Northern California."

Now the ones who like flavor can have flavor.  I will definitely always have the flavored Senseo Pods in stock in our home so that we have them to offer guests.

Its name derives from the quichua word ""mati"" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served. On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea. Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land. In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well. In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts."

It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.<br /><br />I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey. In addition, I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand, at all times, which contains eight cans each of grilled beef, turkey, and chicken, each in their own savory sauce.

05	84349,B0000DGF5S,AEU0TVTYJRUU4,12/29/05,5,5,2,Falling leaves,"I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as ""highest"" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.  We'll see...  M. Buchanan"

They arrived super fast, and they are huge and delicious, but you WILL need to fillet them yourself!!  Half the can is salt -- they are VERY salty!!  Also, the can is marked ""MUST BE REFRIGERATED"" but was shipped via standard UPS. I can only hope that it means ""Must be refrigerated AFTER OPENING"" [emphasis mine]!!  :-)"

05	88678,B0001E6DBU,A18IQME5DCSH2L,10/15/05,0,1,5,A truly spectacular tea,"This tea is easily one of the best in Davidson's line. An intoxicating blend of rich cherry and scrumptious almond, this tea also has the honey note that makes it sweet at brewing. The scent alone is enough to make anyone smile, but the taste is perfection at any temperature. I've tried it from very hot to using it in iced tea and I am delighted with the results every time.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
05	85886,B000633PTY,AO4E3H18XJLWK,1/13/05,1,1,5,Wow!!,These are the best for keeping your dog happy!  And they really help emphasize tasks completed well!
05	59198,B0000TVUQE,A1L43KWWR05PCS,1/16/05,4,4,5,ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS...,"This is a caramel flavored filling/topping that is very popular among people from Latin America. I grew up eating dulce the leche, as my parents were Cuban. My ex-husband is from Argentina, and he, too, grew up eating this mouth-watering, sweet dessert topping.<br /><br />It is delicious with ice cream, with flan, and as pastry filling. I even know people who eat it as a spread on white bread. It is also delicious by itself, though one cannot eat all that much of it in one sitting as it is so sweet. When I discovered its availability on Amazon and saw that it was recommended by a fellow reviewer, I immediately bought three jars, even though the shipping was on the high side. Well, the actual product more than met my expectations, as it was absolutely delicious. I can certainly understand why it was the Gold Trophy winner in the spreads/sweet toppings category at the 2000 Fancy Food Show.<br /><br />I am only sorry that I did not buy more than three jars of it, as I see that it is no longer available through Amazon, and I am plumb out of it. The good thing, however, is that I know how to make dulce de leche. I am, however,  notoriously lazy about cooking. Maybe the fact that it is no longer available will galvanize me into whipping up a batch of this delicious taste treat. If not, I can only hope that it will become available."
05	80977,B0005ZVOPA,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,5/7/05,1,2,5,Chicken Noodle Soup with LOTS of Noodles,"There was a time when we would buy chicken ramen because it was inexpensive.  The flavor is very good and the soup has a lot of noodles compared to canned chicken noodle soup.  This soup is reasonably easy to prepare, and begs to have a few extra vegetables thrown in.  The soup is so simple that even an elementary school child should be able to prepare it.<br /><br />While the soup is relatively low calorie (190 calories), as with many soups it does have a fair amount of salt, with 850 mg of sodium.  If you eat few other foods with much salt, this soup could be a perfect balance.<br /><br />Maruchan Chicken Ramen has been and continues to be a family favorite.  The large quantity of noodles and tasty broth make it perfect for a lunch or dinner meal, especially when you are looking for something a little different."

We made most of the batch for a family breakfast on Father's Day.  Everyone raved how good the pancakes were!, where did we get the mix?, what's the name of it?, and so on.  The blueberries in the mix are small blueberries, but they really had a lot of flavor--they weren't little tiny blue flecks like in some mixes.  The flavor was fantastic all around, and everyone really enjoyed them!  I will definitely be getting everyone a few of these for Christmas!"

We were skeptical at first, but fell in love with it as soon as we tasted it. Truly a perfect tea! We love it as both hot tea or Sun tea!"

They are not golf ball size at all, but much smaller, like marble sized.  They still made great grab gifts though."

05	20723,B0001IVR8A,A3QUK1OICTDHC4,7/5/05,6,10,3,Glad I only bought a 3-pack,"I was definitely expecting something fabulous by the way Oprah and her guests spoke about this product.<br /><br />It was tasty, but by no means the dessert to end all desserts.  My husband, who is the real chocolate lover in our family, just shrugged and said it was okay.<br /><br />Oh well, it was worth a try.  I'm just glad I didn't buy a 5-pack of the product."
