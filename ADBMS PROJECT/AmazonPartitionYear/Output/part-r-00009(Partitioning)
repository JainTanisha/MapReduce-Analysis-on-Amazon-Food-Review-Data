Foolish me -- when I order a product called ""Timothy's World Coffee K-Cup Variety Pack,"" I actually expect it to contain a variety of COFFEE k-cups. Having to order a minimum of two boxes from Amazon only compounded the problem.<br /><br />I am giving this product one more star than it otherwise deserves because when I called the company to complain, they did send me one free box of just coffee k-pods. However, the combination of deceptive labeling and having to throw away a third of the contents of the box unused makes this a poor product choice in my opinion.<br /><br />If this product contained only coffee k-pods, I would probably order it again because the coffee k-pods actually in it were pretty good, but I certainly don't recommend it now."

They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately."

It is only beta now, but I truly hope they will continue it.<br /><br />2.  This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies."

The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)"

These dried pitted plums are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They contain sugar (12 grams per serving) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />In addition, a few of these helps fight constipation really well! Don't eat too many--you'll have stomach trouble--trust me!<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these pitted plums are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that they do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. In my personal opinion, I love to refrigerate these and eat them cold. They are remarkably sweet, too.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the container. Eat or use these before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These pitted plums are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Pitted Plums provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!"

I don't mind paying a few extra bucks for it, to have for me and my fellow Marines to enjoy.  It's just that good that it's worth it!!!<br /><br />  This is a great product and all should try it.

07	62727,B000I1OLT2,AMPPPNBMRAEBF,1/30/07,18,20,5,Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best,"After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!"

Just because it's not from france doesn't mean its not good! A good sparkeling wine (champange) from california, is still better than a bad one from champange france. The tase is waht I expected. Mine were packaged in shrink wrapped plastic and padding stuff, and arrived ok. Truffles, I understand, grow in many places in the world. I haven't tasted the finest quality (cannot find it, much less afford it), but this tastes similar to the other black truffle oils I have tasted (that were more expensive). I have no reservations recommending it, as long as you understand its not as subtile as white truffle, i.e its a bit stronger of a taste. It all what you like and can afford. Its great stuff!<br /><br />The other reviewer should have asked for a replacement, not a refund.

It is cereal with raisins in it, not half raisins and half cereal like some I've eaten), and the wonderfully tasty flakes (whole kernel, double-toasted REAL wheat flakes; not a paste molded into the shape of flakes) stay crunchy-to-al dente until it's eaten.<br /><br />I can only find it locally at my health food store under the name Erewhon Raisin Bran, but it's the same thing.<br /><br />[And re: the couple of ""Yuck"" reviews. They remind me of the time I was visiting a daughter in Florida and decided to make my 10 year-old grandson some chocolate pudding, his favorite thing in the world.<br /><br />I made it from scratch with whole milk, fresh eggs, excellent chocolate, Madagascar Bourbon vanilla, a knob of butter.  I had it cooled in little individual custard cups when he got home from school and proudly sat one of them on the table for him.<br /><br />He took a spoonful and his face fell.  Stunned, I said, ""What's the matter?  Don't you like it?""<br /><br />He said as politely as he knew how, ""It just doesn't taste like  REAL pudding....""  (""Real"" pudding being the little Jello cups in the 6-pack: only kind of chocolate pudding he'd ever had.)  Enough said.]<br /><br />The muffins you can make with this cereal are w/o doubt the best bran muffins I've ever eaten and everyone who tries them says the very same thing.  Here's the original recipe my mother made for us kids with back in the 1940s and I make for my grandchildren today. I'm never without the batter in the fridge. (The recipe given on the Erewhon website is the chic low-fat kind of thing that tastes like dry lawnmower clippings.)<br /><br />1 15 oz. box Skinner's/Uncle Sam/Erewhon Raisin Bran<br />3 C. sugar<br />5 C. all-purpose flour<br />5 tsp. baking soda<br />2 tsp. salt<br />1 qt. buttermilk<br />4 eggs, beaten<br />1 C. veg. oil<br /><br />In BIG bowl, dump all together in the order given (Oil last, at any rate). Stir well. Batter will keep tightly covered in fridge for up to 6 weeks, so you can bake up just what you need. (Makes about 3 1/2 qts. of batter, 50-60 muffins with a slightly rounded 1/4 cup ice cream scoop. I wouldn't try to make giant muffins with this heavy batter. They might overbrown before the middle cooks.)<br /><br />Bake in buttered muffin tin in pre-heated 400 degree oven for 12-14 minutes, lower the temp to 375 for another 5-6 minutes till light golden brown. Run a knife around each muffin and flip on the side so the bottoms don't get soggy.<br /><br />(Don't try to gussie up with vanilla extract, cinnamon, etc.  You won't believe the richness of the flavor, esp. if you'll make it a day ahead and let the malty bran flavor permeate the batter.)"

And the quest has always been worth the journey, when I can find it. Like one other review states...I,too, think that there must be a Skinner's Cult! I could be their leader. My first taste was when my Grandpa bought me a box...and that was around 56 years ago. Hooked instantly!

07	47025,B001E5E3B2,A1KSQOZY8AFWUJ,7/12/07,5,5,5,My 1st choice in raisin bran for 60 years,"The wisdom in the old saying, ""compare apples to apples...oranges to oranges,"" etc. applies here. If you compare Skinner's Raisin Bran to other raisin brans, you are comparing apples to oranges, so to speak. Skinner's is made by an entirely different process than any other raisin brans. While I have had to use Post Raisin Bran and some of the organic products when I was unable to find Skinner's, the difference in taste is dramatic. The difference is in the way each is made. Skinner's is made by steaming the whole wheat kernels, rolling them flat and baking them. The common brands of raisin brans are made from wheat flour and other ingredients, and the flour is most commonly ""bleached and enriched"", having been refined by separating the components of the wheat berry and bleaching the endosperm,the major ingredient in bleached wheat flour. Therefore, cereals made with bleached wheat flour lack the bran and most certainly the wheat germ. Those two nutritionally essential components of the wheat berry (the bran and the germ) not only provide the strong flavor, but also all the healthy ingredients provided by ""whole wheat"". Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that only whole grains can be completely metabolized by the body; refined grains less so and tend to be stored rather than fully metabolized.<br /><br />Therefore, for those cereal eaters who are accustomed to raisin bran or other cereals made from wheat flour with flavor enhancers, the Skinner's at first taste may seem strong, mainly because whole wheat has a strong flavor, which could be interpreted as ""bad"" because it is so different from those made with refined flour. Also, because they are made from the whole wheat berry, the Skinner's flakes have a much firmer texture, the advantage of which is that they do not get soggy in milk before you eat the whole serving.

We do, so it is 5 stars.<br /><br />At the time we bought it Amazon was less expensive  than our supermarkets in quantities qualifying for free shipping.<br /><br />Amazon - keep competetive prices coming (not yet common enough) on quality products (frequent) and we will be sold. Ease of ordering and shipping generally excellent. Choice of packaging sometimes bizzare and wasteful, such as a box many times bigger than necessary with loose boxes of tea and crumpled paper filler."

A few years ago, when my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I quit eating Raisin Bran. Oh, every once in a while I would try some other brand, my husband prefers Kellogg's, but it would always turn out soggy and I can't stand soggy cereal. Recently, I started craving Raisin Bran and Skinner's was the only one I could imagine. So I searched on-line to see if it was even available anymore. To my amazement, there it was. I ordered two cases (shipping was free that way) and shared it with my family. Everyone was very happy and I get to satisfy my craving. I love the whole grain crunch that comes naturally with the rolled oat method and there are so many raisins that you get a raisin with practically every bite. I love Skinner's Raisin Bran."

It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, ""that is why it is called green tea!"""
07	47027,B001E5E3B2,A2EPL8H18FSVXJ,1/10/07,5,5,5,Unlike all other raisen brans -- and better!,"OK, writing a review for a ceral seems silly for an adult. But I really like Skinner's Raisen Bran, and it's hard to get. My local supermarkets will sometimes carry it for awhile, but then stop carrying it, leaving me ""high and dry."" They all carry Uncle Sam Cereal from the same company: US Mills. Having Skinner's available here on Amazon is great.<br /><br />Skinner's Raisen Bran claims to be the first raisen bran, introduced in 1926. That may be, but what's unique about it is that the cereal flakes are not formed by grinding up the grain, making it into a paste, and then forming it into flakes. Skinner's uses toasted whole grain wheat flakes complete with the bran and germ. It's a refreshing eye-opener after spending a lifetime eating typical American cereals and other brands of raisen bran.<br /><br />In addition, Skinner's doesn't seem to coat their raisens with granuals of sugar. Who needs sugar on a sweet raisen?! Well, apparently just about all major brands of raisen bran think that you want it. Look at the raisens next time. It's quite silly. Plus, it's really just wasted sugar calories if you're watching such things.<br /><br />Skinner's is not for everyone, though. Since people are used to the more processed flakes in other cereals, they may not like the crisp, clean crunch of Skinner's. I prefer it. The un-sugared raisens are a bonus too. Personally, I think the ""health food"" supermarket isles and stores should all carry Skinner's. They carry other ""healthy"" brands of raisen bran, and those are horrid; they taste like eating cardboard! Give Skinner's a try!"

Before I tried the powdered I had some of the fresh from my grocery store and really liked it.  As it turns out, this is quite the same as the fresh and about 60% cheaper.<br /><br />We are switching because both of my kids had ear infections galore and now sinus infections galore.  One was always constipated and still is to a certain extent.  And one is showing signs of hyperactivity, which some believe may be related to a food allergy (such as cow's milk).  So I figured better safe than sorry and am switching the whole family."

It took a long time to find an equivalent drink once I got back, but this seems to be the same thing. (ginger tea in tea bags is not the same product, and I could not seem to re-create it by boiling fresh ginger) This stuff is great for stomach problems, but I drink it for the taste even when I am fine. I was surprised to find it here on Amazon - I used to have to search larger Asian stores and odd corners of the internet to get it. I am pleased to see that it has become more available."

07	62764,B000I1OLT2,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,3/31/07,3,3,4,"Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value","****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****"

My Mom bought it for me when I was a little girl and I've loved it ever since!  It has the best fiber content of any raisin bran on the market; no soggy thin flakes with a raisin here and there.  It is chock full of plump, juicy raisins and delicious bran flakes.  I was so happy to have found that Amazon.com carried it. It really is the very first raisin brand ever made.  It's been my favorite for 58 years, and I guess that says there's  something really terrific about this breakfast cereal!  Thanks U.S. Mills and Amazon.com."
07	62765,B000I1OLT2,A4TAYDT1ZW49D,2/13/07,3,3,4,Very good for what it is,"We've been ""product testing"" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama ""Sushi Bar"" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea ""taste"" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. ""Sushi Bar""-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff."

For about the last 30 years, I've been searching out this cereal in local supermarkets, but it keeps disappearing. When I found it on Amazon, I was overjoyed told all my fellow Skinner's fans.  As other people here are saying, the flakes are completely different from the processed fake flakes of almost all packaged cereals because they are rolled out and you can see the grain of the wheat kernel. They taste like real wheat, not cardboard! The raisins aren't sugared, but naturally sweet.  I was outraged when Consumer Reports gave Skinner's a low score about 15 years back.  People must be too programmed to feel that cereal has to be fake and sweet."

My 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and soy, hence the reason for goat milk.  We were going on vacation for two weeks, and I was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination. Being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk I purchase from Trader Joe's, I figured I would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him. It smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible! Words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was.  My poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it.  It smelled so bad, I couldn't even taste it myself.  Maybe we're just used to the regular brand he drinks?  My only advice, try a small amount first.  It is not returnable!!!"

I use it in soups, stews, pilafs, casseroles, mashed potatoes, curries, sauces and more.  Because I use so much of it I was pleased to find that I could get it in quantity and also in powder form, which is easier to deal with than the cubes when using large quantities.  I am no longer a strict vegetarian but still eat like one for the most part, and while I can use this to fine effect in dishes containing meat, fish or poultry, it is nice to know that I can easily acommodate my vegan and vegetarian friends with few or no adjustments to my recipes by using this instead of non-veg broths as a seasoning staple.  Couldn't do without it!"

She has been drinking it since she was 12 months. It's nice having a powder so we can take it with us when we are on the go. There is more information about the milk itself on the meyenberg website. After looking over the website, I felt confident that goat milk would meet my daughter's nutritional needs."

While she was an infant, she had to drink Nutramigen formula and would only drink maybe 4 oz at a time. Once she turned a year old, and I began giving her Meyenberg goat's milk, she began to guzzle it! She loves it so much! She now consistently drinks 8-12 ounces at a time!<br /><br />I mix one can (powdered) at a time, which makes approx. one gallon. We go through about a gallon every 2 days!<br /><br />This milk is such a blessing! We highly recommend it! Amazon has the best price, too. It's so much more convenient and less expensive to purchase it on here and have it delivered to us rather than make countless (and expensive) trips to the health food store."
07	73849,B001E5E3IA,A2LIPLT5LJTN5B,9/20/07,41,42,4,Depends what you use it for,"This stuff is a pretty good sugar substitute, but it really depends on what you use it for.<br /><br />If you are planning on using it in baked goods, I'd suggest that you not. The ""sugar"" has a slightly cooling effect when you taste it (it's hard to explain).  I tried to make cookies with it just to see how they would turn out, and they had that weird sensationy taste to them.<br /><br />This ""sensation"" (taste isn't the right word) is not very noticeable if you use it in small amounts, such as on cereal, on fruit, in smoothies (AMAZING)...and I'd imagine in coffee (I don't drink it, so I don't know).<br /><br />Organic Zero is sweet, and for the most part, it tastes--and even looks--like sugar (it's basically a sugar alcohol). Again, I would recommend it in small quantities, but not for baking purposes.<br /><br />$20ish dollars is an EXTREMELY good price for two packages. I bought some at my local co-op and ended up paying about $15 for one bag.<br /><br />If you're into artificial sweetners, I'd say it's worth a try--it doesn't have scary things related to it like aspartame and nutrisweet do."

Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!"
07	62786,B000I1OLT2,A2GOE7ITDGYVE,1/4/07,4,5,4,very tasty but bags leak the very finely crushed leaves,Before trying this tea I'd been drinking the packets my husband brought home from Japan. The stash had the same nutty flavor of the good japanese green tea but the bags were fragile and leaked tea leaf into the cup. Just a personal pet peeve. I bought the Stash green tea based on a review I read in Men's Health magazine that rated Stash as having the highest level of anti oxidents (and Caffeine) in those tested.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."

I just thought for the price it would be - my bad. I only use the whilry pop popper, so this review is relevant to that method only. It produces somewhat light, crispy popcorn of fairly large size with a real popcorn taste. I did think it would pop larger though. It's good for the coated popcorns I like to make. It's not the best I've tasted though. Fireworks makes some delicious, hulless varieties that have spoiled me, I'm afraid. The company ships fairly fast, and the shipping cost is what I'd expect it to be. I'm ruined by Amazon Prime though, so to pay any shipping at all is a drawback; that being said, for this quality popcorn plus the S&H cost, I won't buy it again - simple as that - and for no other reason than that."

Comes right to my door, free shipping, 6 boxes at a time.  Doesn't get better than that.  I think I know why some people hate it...what they are tasting is good toasty bran flavor and plump natural raisins and what they are used to (Post, etc) is sugar.  Anyway, I love those crunchy little bran flakes and just enough raisins -- Skinner's Raisin Bran is perfect just the way it is."

07	7682,B001E5DZTS,A2POXXIULDRW44,4/14/07,6,6,5,The most convienent way to store and drink goats milk,We have been using Meyenberg's powdered goat milk for several years.  We used to buy their milk in cartons at Walmart and it was good.  The only problem was that we live so far from a Walmart store that we would run out of goat's milk between trips.  We decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons.  Of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk.

I followed the directions the first time, and instead of frozen poop, I just had cooler poop to pick up.  The second time, I sprayed for longer than recommended. This gave me cold, but still not frozen, poop. Granted, if you're picking it up with a plastic baggie, cold poop is slightly more pleasant that still-warm poop, but the product implies that the poop will be frozen nearly solid and that is not the case. (Incidentally, we're talking a pug here, not a really BIG dog)."

This bottle has a label that is gold at the top with the words ""All Natural"" written on it.  The left side of the orgainic bottle has the USDA orgainic seal on it, this bottle does not.  Without the certification seal, a product is not certified organic.  The bubble-wrap that the bottle comes in has a white label with the words ""Frontier Organic Fair Trade Certified Vanilla Extract"", on it, but anyone can make one of those.

One has to realize that goat's milk is not cow's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get's used to something which tastes ""different"". When it is warm, it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste. Cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor.<br /><br />I actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good. It is like ice milk as this is milk, but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet.<br /><br />The recipe was 1 quart milk (8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill)<br /><br />1 cup white sugar<br /><br />1 tsp vanilla flavoring (you can try other flavorings like banana)<br /><br />1/8 tsp salt<br /><br />My electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes.<br /><br />I like the powdered for it's ease and it keeps well. I can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks, so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk. Granted one is used to cow's milk, but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and I am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right.<br /><br />One can will make 3 quarts of milk."

I was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company. These are the best tasting flaxseeds I have ever had. To get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder. We usually grind 2 tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade, crystal light, or tea and drink it down quick before it expands. Flaxseeds are loaded with minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and fiber. They are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation. There are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately it's against the review guidelines to post links so I'll just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google."

This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon.  Each box comes with six tablets.  The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk, break up one tablet, put milk and chocolate in blender, and blend approximately one minute.  I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first.  They add one broken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven.  Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered brands.  This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days."

The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea..."

With little effort I grow a wide variety of delicious and fresh sprouts in my kitchen. The trays stack up nicely and I have six of them, one on top of the other. They require little space. Believe it or not, it's like having a small farm in the house that produces an impressive amount and array of ""fresh vegatables"", albeit in sprout form. The sprouts grown in these trays stay fresh and never develop an unpleasant smell. They taste crisp, are pleasant to eat and have become the mainstay in my daily intake of vegetables in my diet. I clean my trays outside with a spray nozzle attached to my garden hose. This makes cleaning quick and easy, then I rinse them in the sink with some bleach in the water to sterilize them before growing a fresh crop. The trays are foolproof and have changed the way I eat. With the price of vegetables rising in the supermarkets, I've found these trays to be a great money saver - to say nothing of the superior nutrition that eating sprouts provide. I would highly recommend them to anyone!<br /> - Chris Morton"

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."

I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.

At the current price of $15.55 for 6 that makes them $2.59 a pack if you have Amazon prime or use Super Saver Free shipping and that's not a bad deal.  What mnakes these brownies so popular is that all you have to add is yogurt.  I add Vanilla Nonfat yogurt and sometimes I'll toss in two tablespoons of instant coffee of espresso powder to jazz them up.  You don't need butter or eggs - just the yogurt.  Once you do that, you stir 'em up, pour 'em in the pan and in no time you have delicious brownies!  They aren't as ooey-gooey as some mixes but that's what I like about them.  They also aren't cloyingly sweet.  They are simply a nice, fudgey brownie that you don't have to feel too guilty about eating. I always keep a couple packages in the pantry to whip up for unexpected company or for whenever that chocolate craving hits you out of nowhere.  The best thing about No Pudge Fudge Brownies is that they are easy to mix, quick to cook and they always come out to be the same good and fudgey brownie you are longing for.

I got the original version, and then added a tsp of mint and they were AMAZING.  Super chocolatey & chewy and there are a number of ways to tweak the recipe to your liking--like adding shredded coconut, bailey's, caramel sauce, etc.  I will say over $5/ box is kinda pricey, but they are hard to find at a lot of grocery stores, so this might be your best bet.

But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag.

The new dog foods with teeth brushing had just come out in our area so we switched her to one.  When we took her in for the teeth cleaning, the vet said she didn't need it.  Yeah!  Then last year we took our new dog Hercules to the vet and she showed us the CET Hextra chews.  Which my dog treated like the best thing he'd ever seen.  So I went home and ordered some.  Amazon had the best deal I could find by far.  6 months later after daily use of the chews.  Babe went in for her annual again and the vet said her teeth looked like those of a 1 yr old dog.  They even brought other people in the clinic in to see her teeth.  They said whatever we were doing to keep it up."

Swheat Scoop is fine with the cats and doesn't get tracked around as much as some other brands.<br /><br />There is a problem with food moth and other bug infestations in our now hotter summers. Cure: crumple up a few bay leaves in the open litter tray and pop a few in the bag of unused litter.  This also works to protect your herbs, dried beans, grains, etc."

My bag actually came with the bugs in it - when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall. I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever."

I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"

It does sweeten everything - and is good if you have diabetes or just want to avoid sugar.  Too much and it turns bitter tasting on ya, so not too much.  Some people think there is an after taste...or an off taste - but I don't.  No, its not going to taste like a mouthful of real sugar...but it does add sweetness / like you know, diet coke is sweet but it not coke.  The powder can be messy, the drops are easier - but both cumbersome to carry around with you (big disadvantage).  The little packets of this (and they make them) contain maltodextrin - which I avoid...a filler with a high glycemic index (basically corn starch) so know that in advance.  And the packets some of them contain INULIN which is a fiber - and that can cause painful gas.  This is all I know - I hope its been helpful.  Should you try it?  Yeah.  Don't toss it after your first go'round with it though - give it another try and another until you learn how and when/where it will work best for you.  If you want to cook with this please learn about that on the web - I have no idea about measurement conversions for this.  Enjoy."

They pick up salsa well too, especially fresh salsa because of their shape.  You get just the right amount of salsa.  These chips don't take over the dip, they compliment whatever you dip them in.  They're fine without dip also, but if you are used to a salty chip, you might find them a bit plain. Tortilla chips are a staple at our house and these are the best you can get except in an authentic Mexican restaurant.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy them as much as we do."

This is a poison that is now outlawed in New York restaurants, and if you are careful about what you eat you want to make sure you stay away from this.<br /><br />As it turns out, they can claim ""0g trans fat"" because the content is less than 1g per serving, but it's a technicality: the product contains a significant amount of trans fat.<br /><br />Obviously, you're not going to drop dead from using a teaspoon in your coffee once, but regular, prolonged use is detrimental to your health. You're better off staying away altogether anyway, and you may want to do what I did and contact Nestle consumer service to complain about their deceptive practices.

They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack."

It's pretty fricking brilliant that the FDA allows a product to be labelled with 0 trans fat per serving when its actually about a half gram per serving. If the FDA really cared about this they would demand that labelling shows EXACTLY what is in the product. If you drink 2 or more cups of coffee a day with this stuff in it, you are getting a nice big dose of trans fat and doing yourself harm. This is not a liver friendly food. Eat liver friendly and you will live a long life. Your liver is the filter for the body. Just like a pool filter, once it gets clogged, it doesn't work good. Fortunately, the liver is one organ that can repair itself if you let it. Remember, eat liver friendly foods."

It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides.

I bought quite a few, so shipping cost was low also.  Have not look around the site for other produces, but if I need any this would be the first place I looked."
07	46069,B001EO5QZK,A35OD1RKGX6RJK,11/18/07,2,2,4,Great Green Tea,"I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead."

07	38134,B000EPYWO6,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,6/12/07,2,2,5,Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea!,"*****<br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities.""<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of ""Kombucha-Pure"", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

07	13739,B0002EQTIG,A3T1LNBFR866ER,9/10/07,2,2,5,Yummy,This is my favorite tea. Regular green tea tastes a little bitter to me. The addition of the brown rice gives this tea a nice smokey flavor. In the winter I drink at least two cups a day...I can't get enough!
07	34810,B000I1RHMU,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,10/7/07,2,2,5,"Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea","****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"

07	7757,B001E5DZTS,A16VDU1SZFZ3BW,5/6/07,0,0,5,All that and less $ than our local store,"Thanks a-lot for the Review Starflakes.  We haven't made ice cream with it yet, we will be trying it.  Our daughter is now 3, and is also allergic to cows milk and soy.  We found it works well in recipes that can support the heavy cream or buttermilk flavor, like pancakes and mashed potatoes.<br /><br />To the person with the bad review, We had a lot of trouble transitioning to other milks.  We currently mix the whole can plus a quart of fresh milk to make a gallon and a half (weaker concentration than suggested).  Our daughter also demands that we heat it to at least lukewarm (45 sec in microwave).  I thank starflakes again for the explanation that it does taste better warm.<br /><br />We will also sometimes add in a pint of goat yogurt in our blend (usually to the half gallon portion).  We bought a few cans of the condensed for emergency use, when we tried to use the can on a trip, she wouldn't drink it (though we didn't have the normal to blend it with).<br /><br />Even blending it with a quart of fresh milk, we go through 2-3 cans a week, and started buying it by the case when our local store couldn't keep up with our demand, even then we frequently buy them out waiting for the next case.  Hopefully the online supply is more reliable in addition to costing less."

Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really."

However, tastewise I didn't care for it, but I thought..oh that's just me. Then my DH said ""Ohh.h.h..h I dont even like the way it smells.""<br />That's too bad, I love mayo and I love lemon, but this product didnt have an appeal to either of us.<br />Finishing with something GOOD to say..it arrived speedily and I love the label..it's an attractive label."

It is a great option for those who are lactose intolerant and need to live a dairy free lifestyle. It is good to know there is another option other than soy milk. However, I hope Amazon can work on lowering the price or providing better deals on all RD products. You can probably find this product cheaper at your local grocer."

This tea is perfect for ice tea.  My sister says that it is the only tea that soothes her sore throat when she is sick.  This tea definitely has a unique flavor -you will either love it or hate it.  I love it.  I also love all the health benefits of Kombucha.  This will be a tea that I drink for the rest of my life!

She had a lackluster appetite before Merrick came into our home.  I found it at a local organic pet store.  Their price was ridiculous - nearly $3 per can.  I bought a few to try -  I was amazed at the results!  I haven't seen my 75 lb. dog jump vertical with glee in many years.  I mix it with her dry food.  One can will last 3-4 days.  The difference in her level of activity and enthusiasm is unbelievable!  I went to the local store to negotiate their price on buying bulk based on what I could get it on line and the best they could do was a 10% discount.  Needless to say, this seller has a customer for the life of my dog.  Kudos to improving our quality of life at a reasonable price.  This food is so great, I have been tempted to taste the spoon!"

We tried every dried rice pasta we could find, and Tinkyada has been hands-down the best.  The texture is excellent and it is much easier to cook to a proper al dente than any other brand.  It has good flavor.  I personally find the Fusilli form the most appealing.  Indeed, I actually prefer this pasta to just about any dried wheat-based pasta.

07	27560,B000FDDFUE,AV624G630GQB,5/4/07,5,5,5,Good stuff,"As with all the Ryvita Crispbread's I've tried, these are very filling, taste great and you can eat them with absolutely no guilt.  At 35 calories per crispbread and no fat or sugar, you can eat three and be completely satisfied without having blown your diet.  I eat them with some fruit as an afternoon snack.  They perfectly balance the sugar hit you get from the fruit and keep you going for hours."
07	67932,B000G6MBUA,A3MTY0ZE9WYJHL,9/29/07,3,4,3,I dont know if...,I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!

07	19402,B000GZYAT6,A31JHUOKHE5CYF,10/17/07,6,6,5,Very good product,This product is very good for stir fry and also is great for spaghetti!  There are none of the long list of preservatives that you see on other products.  You know what you are eatting - rice and water only.
07	67933,B000G6MBUA,A3E9OJWHMXMYYF,5/27/07,3,4,5,Delicious!,"At first I was thinking, ""cheese flavored chips?""  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious.  The cheese is not overpowering.  They are yummy and crispy!!"

07	20721,B0001IVR8A,A1XD35YRDOVH2J,7/7/07,1,2,5,The Perfect Dessert,"They were easy to make, easy to serve, and everyone loved them. I could even make them at school on a hot day without any problems (except the teachers that were wondering what the strange noises were). They don't taste exactly like the ones at Serendipity III, but that's why people go to New York and spend $8.50 for a glass instead of buying 3 packs for $15 on Amazon!"
07	39851,B000LKXZI8,A3OTHDULJZNH9K,5/26/07,4,4,5,i love this stuff,this tea works very well.  unlike most diet teas their is no pain when it starts to work. i cleans everything out from the night befor. I love this stuff.
07	20722,B0001IVR8A,A1Y56C44GA1TQA,6/6/07,1,2,5,Very good,Very good. My grandchildren love this. Bought it for a young man who broke his jaw so he is really enjoying it.
07	67936,B000G6MBUA,ADS5APY1NKTL4,3/27/07,5,7,5,these potato chips are yummy....,"I try to be good, but when I feel like indulging in some delicious, gourmet potato chips, these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for, when I see them at the natural food store.  The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand."
07	20724,B0001IVR8A,A16EQ0G9Q79LLN,9/12/07,2,4,5,The Absolute Bomb for Chocolate Lovers,I purchased 2 of these as gifts for online friends who love chocolate - they absolutely love them.
07	19403,B000GZYAT6,A39K2LOANZEUEN,6/30/07,5,5,5,Fresh Product,My wife and I bought these online after struggling to find either the noodles in a store or finding fresh noodles.  We use them for one of our favorite recipes for Pad Thai.  We were pleasantly surprised how much better our recipe tasted using these fresh noodles.  Good luck to all chefs.
07	7204,B000ES3LMC,AP3IMUKUQDEQU,1/12/07,2,2,5,Excellent Taste,I just loved the tea.  We just add a little honey and sit back and relax.  It has a slight citrus flavor which I find very refresshing.
07	64310,B001EO5YAC,ABMSXYKU0XPC,5/6/07,3,3,5,Great Coffee for an Automatic Espresso Machine,This makes excellent lattes in our DeLonghi espresso machine.  We really like Lavazza.  It is good quality and reasonably priced.  We have been buying Lavazza for several years now.
07	67942,B000G6MBUA,A28HKCWJ7YF2AI,12/20/07,2,3,3,Not low salt,"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."
07	67943,B000G6MBUA,A36QQYEW0AMJEO,10/26/07,2,3,5,Best Chips I've Ever Tasted,"Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.<br />Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.<br />Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high."
07	67944,B000G6MBUA,A1IVFBJA9KAI1M,10/2/07,2,3,4,Tasty!,"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!"
07	20726,B0001IVR8A,A36D972UH3Z4A4,6/13/07,0,1,4,Delicious!,Love this product! I got this as a gift for a fellow chocolate lover. If you love chocolate than this is a product for you! The only problem I had was that it took a little longer than I thought to recieve it.

07	88668,B000PMJLJO,AZAXJ3OL0Q346,10/26/07,0,0,5,even better than jerky,"Hickory is one of the top flavors when we asked US troops what they like.  They love the steak strips as they are a bit softer but very satisfying.  If being able to carry along a snack, and needing protein is part of your decision, this flavor in a steak strip cannot be beat !  You won't go wrong on this item."
07	67953,B000NY8OY2,A2IZU5JE56G7QF,5/24/07,6,7,5,The best horseradish,"It'll bring tears to your eyes!! Tastes as good as the best homemade horseradish you've ever eaten and the tears are real because it's delightfully ""hot"".."
07	67987,B001E95KQA,A1YUOVUTESW4MZ,5/11/07,6,6,5,Another wonderful tea from Mighty Leaf,"For some reason this tea is listed only as Jasmine, but for those of you looking for ""Mountain Jasmine"" this is it!  This tea smells of Jasmine and makes a glorious afternoon tea as it is light on caffeine."
07	79050,B000LIG91A,A332UD9XXHSSKO,3/27/07,3,3,5,Tangy!!!,This product exceeded my expectations.  Great cranberry flavor!!! We used it as a base for a BBQ sauce put on grilled chicken. It is a little thick and hard to get out of the bottle.  The best part about this product is that there is NO corn syrup to sweeten the product.
07	17283,B000EVIDUY,AE7MO1SL2EVC5,9/10/07,28,31,2,These USED to be the best out there! Now they're just OKAY.,"WHY, OH WHY would Gluten Free Pantry mess with a great thing? The reviews of this product are ALL from pre-recipe change. I wonder what everyone thinks now that the recipe has changed. The FIRST ingredient in these brownies used to be DUTCH COCOA and OH, were they decadent! But NOW, they don't stand out above any other mix out there. They are just ""okay"", where they used to be FAR superior, heads and shoulders above the competition! I'm extremely disappointed. They taste so BLAH now. I won't be buying them anymore."
07	20729,B0001IVR8A,AN38ORS2FJ24K,4/12/07,6,16,1,Terrible People,"It was pretty good the customer service was just bad, 3 of the 5 packs were broken and i got cut by the broken glass sent with it *nothing major* took 3 weeks and 130 cellphone minutes for them to tell me i will get free shipping on my next order. I tried the mix after that because they wouldint refund me anything and i am not allergic to chocolate but after drinking this product maybe 5 minutes after i started vomiting horridly. I let a friend try the other pack*he is also not allergic* He broke out so bad and started swellewing we had to bring him to the hospital. After 15 minutes on hold (at first the lady forgot to hit hold apparently they were very confused) i spoke with a manager and the only thing they could say was a simple sorry and they would send me another half off. I figured hey maybe it was just bad luck so i ordered another and this time instead of broken packets it was missing 3 packets and both spoons. I am really never ordering from this company again."
07	20730,B0001IVR8A,A34QSBSSKMG251,2/7/07,6,16,1,BUGS IN THE CHOCOLATE,I FOUND BUGS IN THE PACKETTE! IF YOU DONT LIKE BUGS YOU MIGHT NOT WANT THIS ITEM.
07	74552,B000F26YJO,A2NSVXLH5C4XWO,12/12/07,2,2,5,Yummy healthy crackers,We tried these while wine tasting and they are just the best.  The seeds and grains add a healthy hearty flavor and texture.  It's hard to find good crackers that are not full of empty carbs.  We tracked them down at Amazon and are so happy to have them in our home!
07	20741,B002LN3A7E,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,9/10/07,3,3,4,"Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats","****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br />****"
07	88669,B000PMJLJO,AQLL2R1PPR46X,5/8/07,0,0,4,Good,"Good quality jerky.  Not too hard.  Taste like real meat.  A little hot for my taste, so I gave it 4 stars.  I would get the plain.  It's pretty spicy."
07	28264,B0007MUM6S,A223YVU3WZW4FO,10/5/07,1,1,5,Ojai Lemonaise is the BEST!!!,I love this product (Ojai Lemonaise) and have been using it for years.  My family loves this product.  I use it to make tuna salad and chicken salad sandwiches.  Or anything I would use plain ol' mayo for.  Our favorite is to mix it in with a little melted butter for artichoke dipping. Yummy!  The only thing I hate is having to order it and have it shipped.
07	88670,B000PMJLJO,AZAXJ3OL0Q346,6/6/07,3,5,5,Steak Strips,"Good brand.  They must pay their sales people a lot tho.  I saw these in stores for at least 50% more and convenience stores.... well, who has a wheelbarrow that big to haul around their change in?<br /><br />Send a lot of Jacks Link's steak strips and jerky to the American GIs in the Sand and found ordering it this way to be much more pliable and easier on your jaw than the same brand in Mart type or warehouse membership stores. If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho.."
07	58796,B000MIFS3Y,AF51KJB3W1YI6,5/3/07,10,11,4,A Good Pantry Staple,"Whether preparing for hurricane season, winter storms, or just stocking the larder, this is a good item to have on hand. Although it, of course, tastes best when hot, it can be eaten straight out of the container if the power goes out."
07	88673,B000PMJLJO,A5XGP2YYCGMTX,3/20/07,1,2,4,Flavor/yes price /Hmmmm,I'll give Jack Links 4.5 stars on flavor and quality but a much lower rating on bulk pricing.  I order quite a bit of beef jerky online in larger quantities from many vendors.  To keep fresh remember to store this in a cool environment.  The 2 ounce package is a perfect portion size.
07	88674,B000PMJLJO,ALJN039DSSX5E,8/9/07,2,4,1,Try it in strip form and from somewhere else,"I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer."

07	22158,B000KV61FC,A20RTZ6I5ADGRL,8/14/07,2,4,2,Expected more...,"I bought this for my Puggle (Pug/Beagle mix) because he loves to chew on empty soda bottles. The bottle part is very tough, but he had the rope part destroyed within an hour. I expected more from it than that. Without the rope, it's just not the same. I consider this to have been a waste of money."
07	25234,B000FMVOLW,A1QCAMPRT2OSEI,9/7/07,4,4,5,Awesome!,"I can't do white flour, and Japanese style breaded pork cutlet was a great temptation I had sadly avoided for a while.  These bread crumbs are SO good...I just love how well they work, making a nice crisp crust on the pork tenderloin.  I think they will also work for oven fried chicken.  They are definitely a crust crumb, and not to be added into meatloaf.  If you like Panko bread crumbs, but want whole grain, you have to try these!"
07	44180,B0007NOWMM,ADAFVGEJWL3XK,3/11/07,0,0,5,Senseo pods,What can I say. We replaced our old coffee makers with Senseo and we all love it. These pods were a great product at a good price.

This is my second child that I am using it with and I love it and so do they.
07	48243,B004SRH2B6,A3BSTFFIKK5YTW,10/24/07,3,3,5,Wow Really Great !,"Just ordered this and the plain coconut milk, I really like the Mango Zico<br />not over sweet but just right and refreshing. As a diabetic have to be careful with my diet and read this is a very healthy for blood sugar control and has the many benefit's of coconut. A little pricey and small serving 11 oz.<br />but is imported from Brazil so i can understand the cost. Hope Amazon put's this on sell will buy again....!"

Gourmet licorice contains licorice oil that smears the inside of the bag, so it looked pretty ugly by the time I opened it (I had intended to give it as a gift to someone who loves licorice). However, it was the SOFTEST of this brand that I had ever had, even softer than the ziploc bags that have the Kookaburra name and logo on them. I think SweetGourmet has the best price to weight ratio for this item, too. I will certainly order from them again."

My favourite part of making anything with melted cheese is the little bits that get brown and crunchy - and that's what these taste like.  They are low in carbs and anyone who is on a low carb diet knows that once in a while you crave a crunchy snack.  They are salty, but I don't eat anything else that is high in sodium so I figure a 2 oz bag isn't going to hurt me."

This gum's taste lasts less than one minute before it is spent and tastes like an old shoe.  Additionally, about the time that the flavor goes bad the gum turns to mush and does not even resemble gum at all.<br /><br />Most Xylitol gums that I have tried to not last that long but this one by far is the quickest to go south.<br /><br />I have had much better luck with others, you probably will as well."

However, since then I have tried many and this is one of my favorite. At first I did not like the medicinal smell. But, the tea taste great. It is a spicy cinnamon licorice flavor, more than sarsaparilla. If you don't like anise(black licorice)taste, do not buy this tea. Instead try the Yogi tea Cocoa Spice. It is sweet and delicious. It's my favorite. The reason I drink Detox is because it does seem to have some detoxing benefits. Also, I feel extremely relaxed after drinking this tea. It really calms me, without making me tired. I am not sure what herb is doing this...but it is almost as good as a glass of wine! So far, I like Yogi tea better than any I have tried. It is worth the extra cost for a great tea."

So far, this has been my experience with all of the St. Dalfour's teas that I have tried, a big selling point for me since I enjoy my teas very strongly brewed.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a nice variation on plain black tea.

But when you are dining on something below the sirloin cut, A1 is a mealsaver. Nothing beats it. It's also good on tenderloin, ribeye, or filet mignon,  but if the meat is top quality, you want to taste the meat, not the sauce.<br /><br />A1 is very good on hamburgers when you want a little zip. I especially like it on 95% lean ground sirloin burgers. The leaner the meat, the more you need a little something else to give it some zip.

The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!

They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email."

I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly."

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."""

I also love that they are made of real food (sweet potatoes), with no additives or fillers, and that they are made in the U.S. rather than China.  They are not as long-lasting a chew as rawhide or tendons, however.  If you are looking for a longer-term doggie pacifier, my recommendation would be a Zuke's Z-Ridge Edible Dental Chew Bone."

Amazon can't seem to package heavy items properly those plastic bags justy don't cut it.  The sauce has a great flavor and adds the right amount of heat.  I like it hot.

It is also tasty when you cook it with salt and butter. I've also tried adding dried cranberries and peanuts to give it a different flavor...yummy! It is a healthier alternative over the regular white rice. Although it is pricier than regular white rice, buying it from Amazon in bulk reduces the cost per container. I've seen it in the standard markets for over $7 each. My only gripe about cooking brown rice is that it takes longer to cook than regular white rice. However, I do recommend this mix to anyone looking for a healthier way to eat!"
07	81200,B000H221OO,A35HOUWHAYZZN6,7/17/07,1,1,5,Spicy and delicious!!,"This sauce has a great Mexican taste beyond its peppery fire, and the bold color, even though created by dyes, is just plain fun to look at. The splash of red on fresh veggies, lettuce, and other dishes is a treat for the eye as well as the palette. A little salty and acidic, its bright flavor goes great with finished Mexican dishes if you want to kick them up, as well as in soups, beans, chili, and added to salsa when you think it needs a little heat. This sauce is not incredibly hot as some are (the kind that work better as dares, really, or can only be taken in a very diluted form), but it's not for the babies either.<br /><br />It's just right for most people, who like some spice, and putting it on the table lets you make milder dishes, and let the individual diners decide how spicy they want it; likewise, it helps you make those Mexican dishes spicier and tastier if you want to cook with the sauce. The price is great--just over a dollar per bottle, but the large quantity works better for restaurants than individual use."

The Sunkist plums tasted fine, but were very dry and somewhat hard.  Mariani plums plus are juicy and sweet.<br />  I actually thought I would never like dried plums and just tried them on a whim. Miriani was the first brand I tried, and I loved them.  But I had a hard time finding them locally, so I tried other brands.  They do not come close to these.  Finding them on Amazon made me very happy.  Don't worry about 12 bags being too many to order at one time. They are so good that you will probably eat more than the ""5 a day"" usually recommended !"

No additional packaging is used to protect the inside.  My box was crushed on three corners, adding to the already crushed chips.  I wound up feeding them to the birds."

07	74409,B001BM3C0Q,A1EP7ITUDTNXC6,3/19/07,0,0,5,Tasty little chips,I tried a lot of Garden Eatin's chips.  These are also very good if you like little chips instead of big triangular size ones.  Great when having Mexican food.
07	74408,B001BM3C0Q,ACAIEIV03NBHY,5/24/07,0,0,4,Too salty!,Otherwise great. If you're a saltoholic like my husband you'll love these. I got these for the kids' lunchboxes but ended up not using them for that because of the salt.

They survive the trip to school in a lunch bag pretty well. For some reason the taste doesn't quite measure up to the regular Garden of Eatin' tortilla chips, but they fill a niche."
07	74406,B001BM3C0Q,A3J4K0AYA39U56,7/12/07,0,0,5,Great snack with or without dip.,"These chips are great by themselves or with salsa, pico de gallo, cheese dip, sour cream dip--probably any dip you like.  They have just enough salt, but not too much. They're my favorite tortilla chip."

But while traveling I bought a bag of these chips ($3.97 I might add) at a natural market type store and just loved them (other than the price).<br /><br />The chips themselves don't have a high oil or greasy taste that some enjoy, but the selection of spices and herbs that Garden of Eatin' has developed is just GREAT.<br /><br />I have bought three cases so far and just love them!"

They are healthy, they are fully digested. These do not build up in the dog's throat like rawhide can, and cause coughing jags."

I'm a casual tea drinker and I think it's a really good cup of tea, and there's no wait for water to boil and for the tea to steep.  My wife is pretty particular about her tea and she quite likes it as well, but feels that there's no beating making tea the old fashion way.  So, not quite as good loose tea or bagged tea, but certainly a lot more convenient and a lot quicker."

Sometimes I can grab 4 or 5 and sometimes it goes for months where there are none.<br />I'm hoping more people will catch on to how great this vinegar is, popularity will grow and I'll be able to grab it at the local Stop & Shop. I't so good that I'll search & buy on the internet when I can't find it and I don't do that for just any condiment.<br />This is great in any dish calling for red wine vinegar. If you think you don't like red wine vinegar, it's because you've been using such substandard brands (progresso - ewww!! and don't EVER buy the store brand!) that you don't know what red wine vinegar shoud be.<br />You should be able to taste the wine. It should not be watery in the least. It should make you happy!<br />I cook with this on a regular basis. I'm basting cornish game hens with this vinegar right now (Mud Hen in a Mud Pack from Barbara Byfiend's The Eating In Bed Cookbook copyright 1962)and I use it when I make my sausages in red cabbage [...]"

While many manufacturers have cheapened their products over the years, Solo has maintained the same quality and consistency over nearly 6 decades.  The filling is clearly dominated by the poppy seeds themselves - the filler and binder is kept to the minimum necessary to make the product work.  Flavor is excellent and consistent.  I highly recommend Solo Poppy Seed filling.  In our family it supports THE classic family pastry: babovka."

I have ordered all varieties they had on amazon, whole wheat honey is specially tasty. no more supermarket bread!"

I was so disappointed when they arrived because the tea leaves must be too tiny as they end up coming out of the k-cup during brewing and you end up with almost the entire k-cup of tea leaves floating in your tea cup.  YUK.  I am so disappointed.  I wish someone would come up with a good decaf k-cup of english breakfast tea... please!
07	54091,B000YSQA7U,APJAZUZAXI6KX,12/13/07,22,23,5,Rainforest Honey is a great idea!,Honey production is good for the rainforest. This kind of low-impact use is something that we need to support! I use this honey for sweetening almost anything that I used to sweeten with sugar. For a 6 pack of Organic Honey this is a deal! I paid $8 for one bottle of organic honey the last time that I bought it.
07	25203,B000FZRYPO,A1VHI0P51KLM0I,11/8/07,2,2,5,Fabulous Pasta,This low-carb pasta is not like any other low carb pasta. It is made with semolina and taste better than any dried high carb pasta. Absolutely the best dried pasta I have ever eaten and it is really low carb.
07	1195,B000JWEEB0,ANAUU7FNHWAVO,3/21/07,2,2,4,Apple Cinnamon Muffins,"Anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring.  We are new to the Dixie Carb Counters line, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste.  Some of the other low carb lines (like Atkins) have a terrible aftertaste, or require the user to have a great imagination. (Yes....this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar.)  But the Dixie Carb items are great.  Easy to make, nice portion size, great taste, and no imagination required.  It really is a muffin!  And...no sugar alcohol!  My only issue is that they are a little pricey.  Otherwise perfect!"
07	1218,B005O072PC,A1P70MC7XXRFX8,12/30/07,2,2,4,Tasty,"Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore."
07	22855,B000RZAJL8,A37GJRP6G1J63N,3/8/07,1,1,5,Good quick snack,"Very high in protein and high in convenience factor. Not as high in fat as Slim Jims, but not nearly as spicy."

I made gallons of the soup and it all sold.  Many people commented on how good it was and many went back to buy another cup.<br />Since it is lacking in chicken meat, I stewed some chicken beforehand and added it.  adding the chicken meat seems to be the only thing that would make this tasty soup better!"

07	78971,B001E5E34E,A23V7QUI3SFJTV,5/16/07,5,5,5,Perfect Cup of Tea,"I drink one to two of these K-Cups a day (have been doing so for 6 mos now).  Love it - perfect tea - not bitter not weak.  I have come across the occasional K-Cup with a bad lid seal (and it will blow the grinds into the cup then) but I choose not to get worked up over the failure of a 40 cent item when the others in the pack are fine.  2008 EDIT: Ok, , I have to agree with the other reviewer a little more - the quality of these K-cups is inconsistent and they do blow grinds more often then they should.  I am still drinking this tea as much as ever as the flavor is not replicated in any other brand.  2009 EDIT: It's June 2009 now and this is still my main drink.  The K-Cup blowout issues seems to have been resolved in the last few boxes.  They must have fixed the problem.  A great tea."

He really likes hot stuff so I thought these would go over well.<br /><br />I took one piece and the bag was mine from then on.<br /><br />These are FABULOUS candies.  The pepper in it really gives it a bite and the cinnamon really bursts in your mouth.  If you like cinnamom candy I highly recommend getting this."

You can't tell that it's low carb. In fact, I used it in a soup that I made for a group and everyone went for seconds. I paid less getting it at Amazon than I would have at the Al Dente site. Got free shipping too so it only cost me $2.50 a bag."

07	71081,B001E77LT6,A22QATUZUP01TT,7/9/07,12,19,1,Nutri-NOT Bars,"These bars are a great example of a sneaky marketing ploy by a major food corporation. By using the word ""Nutri"" as part of the name of the product, consumers are tricked into thinking these are healthy. These should really be called CANDY-GRAIN bars! Here's the nutritional low down:<br />1. These bars contain 13 grams of sugar. (Notice the first ingredient in the ""filling"" is strawberry preserves, made of high fructose corn syrup and strawberries. The next ingredient is...corn syrup, followed by fructose, which is also a sweetener.) More sweeteners appear on down the ingredients list. Out of the 140 calories in this tiny bar, 62 calories come from sugar.<br /><br />2. These bars have partially hydrogenated oil in them. That's the type of oil that contains artery clogging trans fat. Yuck.<br /><br />3. They contain less than 1 gram of fiber. That means that the bars include very, very little whole grain or fruit, either of which would increase fiber content.<br /><br />4. They do contain some vitamins. But these are all in the form of additives. (They are listed at the end of the ingredient list.) Essentially, they've ground up a bit of a vitamin pill into each bar. Obviously, there's no need to eat candy to get powdered vitamins. If you want the extra vitamins--just take a vitamin pill!<br /><br />5. While they were at it, they added 5% DV of sodium per bar.<br /><br />I am not opposed to enjoying junk food now and then. If these bars tasted great, I might indulge in one as dessert from time to time. However, there's lots of junk food I like better...so I won't bother with these bars. A better choice, for taste and nutrition, is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JHL8I2"">Kashi TLC Crunchy Granola Bar - Pumpkin Spice Flax, 6 - 1.4 oz Bars, 8.4 oz</a> or one of the other Kashi bars.

They are so much better than the kind you buy at Circle K. Buy in the 5 pound bag, and you will save money as opposed to buying from the Sweet Factory at the mall."

The flavor is very strong with a pleasant, lingering after-taste.  The licorice arrived in an unlabelled plastic bag, but the bag was clean (unlike what another reviewer received), and the product arrived four days after I ordered it.

Well, it's about as big as an adult human head.  Big! And heavy!  (And buying two gets you free shipping!)  The only better bulk price one can get (that I'm aware of) is at the Haribo factory in Bonn, Germany (and if you like Gummibaerchen, I suggest you visit).<br /><br />As for the candies themselves, Frogs are not my favorite.  An entire bag of them yields no variety at all.  If Amazon starts selling the classic bears (which are a multitude of flavors and are smaller and easier to chew up) I would buy those over Frogs in a hot second.  (The sugar-free kind are not the classic version, and some people have digestive problems with the artificial sweetener. NB this is not the case with Frogs - they are sugar-sweetened.)<br /><br />A note about the Haribo ""catchphrase"": the German ""Haribo macht Kinder froh und Erwachsene ebenso"" is better translated ""Haribo makes kids happy / and adults likewise"".  So, ""The happy world of Haribo"" is just a rhyming addition to English-language packaging.  INFORMED."

I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."

This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You'll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it's simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won't be disappointed!"

07	74343,B001ELLA5I,A2D32UDQYHL593,8/4/07,1,2,2,"OK, but Weak.","For about six months, I really thought I liked this coffee, and then I realized that I was adding way more cream than is usual for me.  This is because the coffee doesn't taste very good, so I have stopped buying it.  Granted, it is better than freeze-dried crystals or stuff from the gas station, but really, is that saying much?"
07	56960,B0007W4VXI,A28HNHRJV35HHY,1/15/07,5,5,5,Nice selection,"If you are just starting out w/ espresso, or looking for a new brand-THIS IS FOR YOU!  I thought this was great.  It gives you 2 of each.  You are able to try so many different types of espresso in just 1 purchase.  See what you like & go from there.  I actually enjoyed all of them.  I give this sampler 5 stars."

Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut, but this comes close to the flavor.  Don't waste your time on canned coconunt water - it's awful IMO.  Zico has a lower sugar content than the other brands I've sampled (14gms/serving vs. 20gms/seving).  It is isotonic, high in potassium and rich in electrolytes.  You can practically live on it!  If you have an upset stomach, it settles it immediately.  I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat.  Her potassium levels were very low.  She was able to drink this and keep it down.  It helped improve her postassium levels and settled her nausea.  A friend of my  9 yrs. old son's had a ""tummy"" ache while we were at the state fair.  I happened to have a Zico in my purse and gave it to him.  He loved it.  His stomach ache ceased and we were able to enjoy our time at the fair."

The fine grind produces really rich flavor... easily rivals Starbucks.  Probably better.  Don't be intimidated by the ""Lite"" tag.  It is a medium-dark roast, with flavor to match.

They arrived yesterday, and I immediately ripped open a bag.<br /><br />They're good, but the texture isn't quite the same as gummi bears with animal-based gelatin. Something about he chewiness isn't quite right. You could easily slice these with the dull side of a knife. A regular gummi, on the other hand, would require a few strokes with a serrated blade. The consistency, however, is very good; they're not too hard or too soft. And the flavors were even better than many brands of regular gummi bears.<br /><br />Overall, they're definitely the best vegetarian alternative to traditional gummi candies that I've found. They're much better than the ones from the bulk bin at Whole Foods."

Australian licorice is probably the best in the world, in my opinion.  The service with this company was excellent.

This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time."

What's really nice is that I didn't know that you could get single-origin pods, and at least two of the brands in this sampler offer them, so it's great to taste the differences in the single-origin coffees as well as the differences in roasts between manufacturers.  Find what you like, and then you can get larger quantities of the pods you really like.  No joke about taking notes, either.  It helps to keep track of which ones you like and dislike...  There is definitely variation in the flow through the different pod brands too- so find what works well with your machine too."

I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears (or Gummi Bear wannabes), and these did not taste anything like those.  The flavors were not very distinct or fruity.  The texture was also very different and not very palatable.  I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin, and I assume that is why the texture is so different.  However, I have eaten another brand (Sunny Bears) of gelatin-free ""Gummi Bears"", and their texture was very different, more like jelly candy.  I would buy the regular Gummi Bears, but I am allergic to dyes and I can't find any that are dye-free except these and the Sunny Bears.<br /><br />After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them, they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item.

07	2518,B000RUI0MS,AFLPET76P1AO6,6/28/07,2,2,5,Excellent Product,"I have been plagued by white flies for over a year. Neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely. I decided to try this as it's made by a respected international brand & I thought a systemic product might work.<br />A week after the first application there was no reduction in infestation but by the second week I started to notice less & less of the little vermin. By the time I was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other shrub. I had even used it on potted plants which were also infested & it worked on everything.<br />Remember, the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully.  Also if like me, you don't always remember to spray regularly or get the underneaths of the leaves, then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every 6-8 weeks is certainly a lot easier to use."

In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week."

It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its [...] effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas. White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />****"
07	13720,B000AY9U20,A3S15YGZ6W6EV2,7/2/07,7,8,4,Darned good for a packaged cookie,"Unlike some of the other reviewers here, our packages of cookies arrived intact, sometimes even overly packaged in that unique-to-Amazon way.  Once we got the cookie packages out of the huge outer box, pushing aside all the bags of air, and then grabbing the inner box (what would be shipped to a supermarket), we found that we had some darned tasty cookies.  Real chocolate chips and a generous amount per cookie, enough to say that it would be tough to take a bite of cokie without getting a chip.  The batter holding things together was good, without nuts or any strong flavoring that would keep it from overpowering the taste of the chocolate.  Nicely crunchy,  as is normal for box cookies.  No one will ever mistake these for homemade, but they are pretty good for packaged cookies."

I paid $14.50 for the candies which is a pretty good value for the amount you get.  However, I was charged a Shipping and Handling rate of $8.50 which made this a rather expensive purchase.  I do understand that postage has gone up all over the country and that candy weighs more than some items, however the site lists a Standard S&H rate of $6.00 within the U.S. so that my grand total was a bit steep.  Not sure I can afford to be a regular customer even if the variety of merchandise is good!  I will enjoy the precious Fruit Gems!"

Great deal right now, and with 2 bags, you get free shipping! I got regular gummi bears and cola bottles, and I think my husband ate more of them than I did and he isn't a big gummi fan!

It's almost tasteless (which is a good thing sometimes) and has a high smoke point.  This oil lends itself to flavoring with other ingredients (like chili pepper, truffles or spices).  Overall, I'm a big fan of grapeseed oil because of it's neutral flavor and this product does not disappoint me."
07	35411,B000GW46D4,ALJN039DSSX5E,8/9/07,2,4,1,Try it in strip form and from somewhere else,"I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer."

Always delicious whether cold(chewier) or warm(melts in your mouth... no offense to M&M's) these are sometimes reason enough to get me to go to the movie theater.  Buy 4 boxes of these and even if the movie is awful(and how many really aren't these days?!) the night won't be wasted... just try to regulate yourself so you haven't killed them before the previews end(try to eat them one at a time rather than handfuls I've learned)!  So why only 4 stars then?  Well although the candy is easily a 5 star candy it can have DISASTROUS effects on anyone who has dental work like fillings or caps.  I have literally been brought to my knees in pain by this candy!  There is nothing worse than enjoying a Milk Dud, when all of a sudden... sharp pain and the sudden taste of chocolate dental cement exploding in your mouth!  So in closing, if you have perfect teeth then this is a 5 star candy easily(although if you eat too many of these you won't have perfect teeth for long but...), if not; 4 stars but still worth the risk... just eat carefully!"

First of all, it's just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if you've had those by Envirokids.

It smells pretty weird, and whenever I eat it around my friends, I get funny looks and wrinked noses, but the smell doesn't affect the taste at all! Though you don't want to replace actual fresh fruit and vegetables with this bar, I do think it's better than not having them at all, and I try to keep one in my bag for the really long days. I definitely prefer eating this to vending machine snacks or yet another fast food meal (the only choices near my school)."

07	12607,B000EW0XFQ,A2RRXEND0UBV3D,4/1/07,1,1,4,Non-cardboard gluten-free cereal,"I almost didn't buy this from my local high-end grocery store because the price was so outrageous, but I'm glad I decided to go for it.  This is one of the better gluten-free cereals I've had.  It is not just like Cheerios, of course, but it has a pleasant taste of its own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful.  It doesn't get soggy immediately like some gluten-free cereals, nor does it have that familiar ""cardboard"" texture those of us with celiac know all too well.  This product seems to have avoided the usual gluten-free problems, and I give the makers credit for that.<br /><br />I think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it -- of course, I can always just add some myself -- and the price is still high compared to similar gluten-free cereals, regardless of where you buy it, but I think it's definitely worth trying if you're on a gluten-free diet and need something palatable.  I'll buy this again."

They don't seem to melt together when they get warm.  The white belly texture is almost like a toughened up version of marshmallowish texture. Interesting on the tongue.  The flavour of the frog is interesting as well.  Some say a pineapplish sort of green tea pear flavor. Same flavor as green frogs I've found in department store/food places, so I'm guessing its the universal frog flavor or the same brand more likely."

The Peanut Crunch contain peanuts, sunflower seeds and almond flour.<br /><br />I have always liked granola and protein bars because they are easy to take with you and give you a quick pick me.  Low and behold, I have found a replacement!

I first has these on a United Airlines flight, and didn't quite know what to expect.  I ended up liking them so much, that I bought two 18-packs on Amazon.  They're a pretty good healthy snack, and my kids like them too.  (They, of course, didn't know exactly what to think at first about these either, but they ended up liking them.)"

The ""Organic Premium"" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better."

The taste is not overwhelming and the finish is smooth and sweet. I have never had any snails or other ""non-leaf"" items in my tea! Besides, if it comes as a tea bag, how can the snails be in the bottom of your cup?? Shouldn't they be in your bag? I think you should wash your cups more often, or step away from the pipe!"

The flavor is malty and rich, with no bitterness or off-flavors. Stands up well to milk and a bit of sugar but would also be excellent without them, say, as an iced tea in summer. I am a simple tea drinker, not a gourmet expert. I simply like this tea a lot and will purchase it again."

When using it to make pizza crust, I could not even cover half the pizza pan, and the taste was horrible.  I used it to make biscuits, and they were incredibly dry and had no flavor.  I tried again, adding some margarine, and they still tasted awful.  I tried to make pancakes, and the batter was as thick as cement.  I tried adding more liquid, but they were horrible.  I cannot imagine how this product is still on the market. Krusteaz used to make WONDERFUL low-carb baking products, so I know it can be done.  This stuff, however, is awful."

Recently she was getting picky about eating and not wanting the either type of the canned k/d.  Based on the Amazon reviews, I ordered the Hi-Tor Neo Diet hoping that she would love it.  At first she did love it (something new/different I think), but now she is very ambivalent towards it and lately has preferred the k/d.  Perhaps it is due simply to her personality or perhaps it is due to her stage of renal disease, but I have not seen any difference between k/d and the Hi-Tor Neo.  Other than the renal disease, she doesn't have any health issues and is still pretty frisky for being 16 years old."

07	66509,B0000CEPDP,A1BU98PLPBIFY5,11/20/07,7,7,5,Wonderful product!,Unfortunately my cat has been in cronic kidney failure for some time so he needs to have a low protien diet. We tried the one from the vet and he wouldn't touch it. I then tried this and he eats it really well. It's been hard to find at pet stores recently so finding it on line is a god send. My vet is very pleased with my cat's weight gain and one of the reasons is he likes this so well. I definately recommend this for anyone who's cat needs to be on a low protien diet. The price is much more economical than the KD diet from the vet and cats seem to find it much more palitable.
07	46055,B001EO5QZK,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,8/5/07,4,4,4,Very Bergamot-y Tea!,"****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"
07	66510,B0000CEPDP,AD8ZKD2Q9J6P,11/12/07,7,7,5,My cat ate it!!,My 15 yr old cat was diagnosed with kidney disease a couple months ago and upon my vet's suggestion I began feeding kitty the Prescription Diet K/D wet and dry food.  My cat stopped eating the wet food all together after about a week (the dry food wasn't touched from the start) and started losing weight which was concerning.  I tried the Hi-Tor Neo Diet after reading the good reviews on Amazon.  I'm pleased to say my cat eats the Hi-Tor (my cat didn't care for the vita gravy stuff) so I didn't have to resort to force feeding (thank goodness!).  I'd definitely recommend the Hi-Tor as it's low protien and it's more palatable than the K/D.
07	49635,B000RE93ZC,A3GB38MC6ZSGPD,10/31/07,1,1,5,Excellent convenience,Very satisfied.  It was delivered earlier than expected.  I bought this so my elderly mother wouldn't have to mess with loose coffee grounds.  She loves the convenience and the taste.  I will be ordering more.
07	47111,B000E1BLMG,AEC5XSH3YXRNO,11/30/07,0,0,5,Fantastic taste!,This pudding is one of my favoritest of the whole Jell-O family.  It's really good when you have a chocolate cravings but don't want to eat anything too sugary and calorie rich!

He loved the taste and didn't have a problem keeping it down.  It also kept him hydrated while building his strength back.  It's a little expensive but well worth it in the long run.
07	47112,B000E1BLMG,A1FP5ZLSKR07SU,11/15/07,0,0,4,Real good -- but not 5-star,"I've tried most of the Jello Pudding Sugar-free/fat-free flavors -- and I'm re-ordering all of them.<br /><br />I have found that the Chocolate Fudge and the Chocolate do not dissolve as well, nor set quite as well, as the other flavors. They both taste great, and are only slightly different in flavor from each other. As sugar-free/fat-free ways to eat chocolate, they are wonderful. But it is more difficult to get these chocolates to mix and to not be runny.<br /><br />The chocolate fudge when it comes out runny does make a delicious sugar-free/fat-free syrup."

07	48261,B004SRH2B6,ANWBTNWFJC4FF,1/11/07,2,2,5,Nature's own soda pop and great for athletes' too,"Crisp when chilled and refreshing without synthetic flavorings or added sucrose, Zico is the packaged beverage my yard men prefer. The smart-paper carton packaging created less bulk waste than canned drinks, and nature's own engineering packs this fruit punch with five electrolytes, the most overtly critical of which is potassium. I didn't think I would like this product but bought it because I cannot quite manage the full-time taste for spring water and herbal tea my yoga regime suggests. VERY helpful for those weaning themselves off alcohol and conventional mystery soda-pop."

I bought a few cans but was very disappointed to learn they changed the recipe. The flavor is still there (well, mostly) but the wonton fillings are no longer bulbous, filled sections, they are now paper-thin fillings(no exaggeration, it's just a thin line) - the wontons aren't round any more, they're flat! The wonton filling was the best (and main) part of the soup but it's practically gone now.<br /><br />I'm hoping they go back to their old recipe and not be so stingy on the filling. The wontons aren't abundant and they're tiny, so how much could it really cost to fill them and satisfy their customers?"

I mixed it with soymilk and it tasted like pea-flavored chalk.  I thought I might have used too much powder so I tried half the amount of powder and it still tasted the same.  Not wanting to give up, I mixed in a scoop of strawberry flavored whey protein and it truly tasted like a combination of strawberry and chalk.<br /><br />My fiancee then tried it and couldn't take more than a sip.  In the end, I was able to down three cups of it, but I don't think I can drink any more in the future. I am going to take them up on their money back product guarantee."

In fact, your safest bet is to ONLY order them in the dead of winter.  LOL!  As long as you do that, be prepared for a truly amazing treat!  This package comes with 12 bite-sized delicacies.

The nuts are a bit small, if you are used to larger varieties, but that is a small problem.<br /><br />I found they were not good for my feeding frenzies. Stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea, as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat. Taken at a more leisurely pace, they are a real treat."
07	78827,B001E5DZSO,A281NPSIMI1C2R,7/4/07,1,1,5,From Cane Grown in Volcanic Ash,"I first found this sugar while working at Larry's Market in Seattle. The India Tree company is also located in Seattle. It was one of the greatest food discoveries I'd forgotten about. Well, not quite. I just had no idea why the sugar we ate in Africa was so rich and similar to molasses in color. This sugar is milled on the island of Mauritius off the coast of Africa and has the divine flavor only possible from cane growing on volcanic ash.<br /><br />Here in America, most of the brown sugar seems like white sugar coated in a brown coloring in comparison to this rich, dark and almost seductive slightly salty tasting sugar. When I found this sugar, it brought back tons of childhood memories. Mostly memories of eating a spoonful of sugar as a treat. This sugar is ""that"" good.<br /><br /> Muscovado is slightly moist, has a very high molasses content and is delicious in gingerbread, coffee cakes, chocolate cakes and anything with chocolate in it. You can basically use this sugar in any recipe that calls for ""dark brown sugar.""<br /><br />When making cookies, you will notice some of the lumps don't quite work themselves into the dough. This is no problem, because then you just find a few sugar lumps in your cookies. If you prefer your sugar to be perfectly soft, you can add a piece of apple to your sugar jar until the sugar softens.<br /><br />This is one of my ""Top Ten"" ingredient finds of the century.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

It's very convenient to order online, rather than look for it in stores. This is a great product, although some people do prefer using the liquid concentrate for cold drinks. Just remember that, with Stevia - less is more!"

I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."

This seems to be the real thing, dark brown and almost gummy with all the minerals from a large amount of the molasses.  Rich flavor, I use it in coffee.  Seems like it might be too strong when you just try it on it's own, but it has a positive effect on whatever I add it to."

We have tried many different brands and these are our favorites for several reasons. We like the fact that they are organically grown and that they taste fresher and sweeter than many other brands we have tried. We also like that the price is really good.

07	19513,B000E3VANE,A1F7SX3GNVBNE3,6/4/07,6,6,5,This is the best flavor of Zatarain's - universal pleaser.,"I love all the flavors of Zatarain's.  I love to cook cajun style food and will make my own from scratch when I have the time.  Reality means I usually focus on cooking the main course and will use boxed shortcuts for side dishes.  Zatarain's really shine in this role.  You give up surprisingly little for a ready mix product.  The flavors are within shouting distance of the real deal.  Compared to most foods made from a mix that require less than 2 minutes of your attention - it's practically a miracle.<br /><br />The Jambalaya and the Black Beans & Rice are the best flavors.  The Jambalya is hot and spicy - so kids don't like it.  The black beans & rice is a little spicy too - but subtle.  Mainly it's zesty and hearty and delicious.  My children eat it.  My little son just devours it - and has since he was a tot.  My daughter less so.  Actually I think I love this stuff more than my wife - so maybe there's a gender thing going on.  It's a little greasy when made properly.  I recommend using 2 1/2 cups of water, instead of the 2 3/4 it recommends on the box - for thicker, less soupy rice.  The foil lined container is bug proof and keeps for a long time.  Because it's a big flavor it sits best next to something assertive - like steak or blackened anything.  It's a regular side for us on BBQ nights."

That being said, this is good stuff and at the time of this review I am unable to find the twinnings, so I am buying this tea and enjoying it without complant."

The product I received from Petco was dry as a Bone. It could be compared to eating a Fish without debonning it first. You wouldn't feed your Family Fish Bones. My cats are my Family.<br /><br />Maybe te product I received was no the usual quality, but it was dry, dry dry. Both the Salmon and Whiting were equally dry."

They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time."

She pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco. hot cocoa sure passed the test with her.  She prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like ""milk chocolate"".  I do, too!"

I haven't noticed any major differences in the dogs habits or frequencies, other than her eating habits.  Before, she acted very finicky and sometimes would take all day to finish one bowl of food.  Now, she eats the whole helping in less than 30 seconds.  She really seems to like this food.  I will be sticking to this brand it looks like."
07	29010,B000W8XOT4,A1JL79Q32C5FY7,12/2/07,8,11,5,Works as advertised,"After trying this product for about one month, I can say that it definitely provides me with more energy in the morning.  It also seems effective in fighting off the initial effects of a common cold (at least for me). I found that this product dissolves best with ice cold water/juice. Overall, this product seems to work as advertised."
07	19549,B000084ETV,ASAUHWXTIOMMZ,3/31/07,0,0,5,Very impressed,"Although I have not bought canidae through Amazon (there is a local store near me that carries the life all stages 40LB bag for $35) I just wanted to write in and remark how impressed I am with this food.  I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba, which he stayed on with me at 1st.  After talking to a friend who breeds world class vizlas, she told me how she feeds them Canidae and how wonderful it is.  I switched over to Canidae then thank god and ever since.  My chocalate lab people actually think is a black lab.  He is the darkest chocolate lab u have ever seen, his coat is so beautiful and glossy, when he was on the eukanuba it was light brown and discolored.  Coats can be a huge problem with choc labs, but canidae has solved that problem.  With all the problems with menu foods that include so called good foods like eukanuba, science diet, iams, etc, it is a relief i can trust canidae and not be worried about all that.  Very impressed overall....."

I thought I would give some a try and Pod Merchant seems to carry them all (I lived in Italy for several years and Pod Merchant has some Italian coffee brands that even I've never heard of).<br /><br />The sampler packs are a fun way to try different brands.  Some are better than others, but trying them out will keep you from later ordering 100 of something you don't like.<br /><br />The order was processed quickly and they were delivered no problem via UPS.  There were also a couple of ""freebie"" pods and a coupon as a thank you for the order which I thought was a nice touch."

I don't allow regular cheetos in the house because of what's in them and this one is allowed because of what's not. When you find artificial preservatives/flavor enhancers in food that's not good for anyone, and if someone has a learning disability those preservatives can make those kind of symptoms worse.  If you can pronounce it, you probably shouldn't be eating it.  This a  very tasty and much healthier crunchy snack that can be enjoyed by anyone."

My favourite part of making anything with melted cheese is the little bits that get brown and crunchy - and that's what these taste like.  They are low in carbs and anyone who is on a low carb diet knows that once in a while you crave a crunchy snack.  They are salty, but I don't eat anything else that is high in sodium so I figure a 2 oz bag isn't going to hurt me."

Haven't found a  better cereal to start the day.<br />I eat it every morning and never get tired of it. I add cappuccino  soy<br />milk, a little stevia and a little extra cinnamon."
07	44917,B000LKV4QI,A2TBFEYSTODE4F,12/13/07,4,4,5,Like extra healthy Grape-nuts,"This is the only Ezekiel 4:9 product I've tasted, but I personally like it.  My first experience with it reminded me of Grape-Nuts - except much more crunchy.  Took a bit to get used to that, but then I was hooked.  I'm not especially fond of hot cereal, so I've never tried it this way, but I bet it would be good if you do like your cereal warmed - or if you find it too crunchy to eat cold.  People with false teeth or chewing difficulties might want to either eat this warm or let it soak awhile.<br /><br />I noticed that many reviewers say they eat this with soy milk.  I recently learned that studies have shown that soy is not healthy for you, particularly the processed forms such as soy milk and soy powder.  Please do your research.  For myself, I've decided I'm actually better off with cow's milk than with soy milk. Here's just one of the many articles on the subject: [...]<br /><br />Back to the subject ... I really do not taste much cinnamon in this cereal, so if you're not crazy about cinnamon, rest assured this cereal will not be overpowering.  It only has 1 gram of fat per 1/2 cup serving and contains 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber.  I find it a great alternative to eggs if you like to start your day with a good source of protein.<br /><br />Now I think I will try the almond variety ... and will post a review after I've tasted it."

It tastes good and the cinnamon and raisins add just the right sweetness, without added sugar.  The price on Amazon makes it more affordable, and since it is organic, the amount of pesticides would be less, making it more healthy for you.  Definitely a winner!"
07	46057,B001EO5QZK,AAVXLDJPBOJBW,1/16/07,6,7,4,About right...,"My experience so far with black organic teas is that they tend to be lighter in flavor that their non-organic counterparts although I can think of no good reason for this. Stash's Organic Ceylon is no exception - it has a good, but subtle flavor.<br /><br />The quality is good: the leaves are small tips and there is very little tea ""dust"" or stems in the bag.<br /><br />I have blended this 1:1 with Stash's Organic Assam for an easy drinking English-style tea."

However, I found it greatly improved the flavor & added nutrition if I grated an apple into the mix. It increased the much needed moisture, & it was certainly a nutritious breakfast."

07	41420,B0000TU80S,A2UX08W68FF3IY,12/2/07,1,1,5,Delicious and unusual crackers,I originally found these at Wegman's and tried the Chili and the Olive Oil and Sea Salt varieties.  They were a big hit with everyone that tried them.  When I returned to Wegman's to get more they were out of the Olive Oil and Sea Salt so I headed online.  I recommend that you try these with relatively strong flavored cheeses since they are fairly thick and aggressively seasoned.  Wegman's got them back in stock so I will buy from them because of the great difference in cost.  On line is very expensive.
07	3666,B000FDKQC4,A1CUJQ3Q14G0OV,3/9/07,1,1,1,Poor Food Design!!!,"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good."

The red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder. The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder. The black pastas are flavored with squid ink, the off-white are au naturale. The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.<br /><br />The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!<br /><br />To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege.

Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."

The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!"

He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad."

I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.

I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.

Otherwise, the only problem I've had is the ocassional cup of creamer that takes too long to open (overly sealed or something.) From a taste perspective, it blows other Irish Cremes out of the water. Also, no refridgeration is required so it lasts for a long time. I stock up on these when I'm headed for a cruise, to a hotel for business or somewhere else where I know I can't refridgerate and they aren't likely to carry my Irish Creme."

I can see why she didn't want to part with them - the cookie part has a light chocolate-y cocoa flavor that isn't too intense and the filling is just the right consistency (not lard-y like Oreos).  I originally bought the 25-pack thinking that I would share with people at work, but now that I have them I think they may be all for me.  I'm giving them 4 stars because I just know that I'm going to end up eating all of them.  You might think that this would be a defect in me, but I choose to blame the cookies.  That's how I roll."

They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months?"
07	19571,B000084ETV,A3NTV9VHMBY1KH,4/4/07,9,9,4,Very good ingredient list with extras.,"I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it."

He couldn't digest any milk-based formula, any lactose-free, or any other brand of soy (name brand or generic). After trying half a dozen other formulas, we're devoted to Nestle soy. I also second the Walmart recommendation for savings. Haven't found it cheaper anywhere else."
07	19574,B000084ETV,A1IX0NC997O0NS,5/31/07,11,12,5,Not recommended after they changed their formula,"I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good)."
07	19575,B000084ETV,A1KPALLWZ73M27,10/21/07,7,7,5,"Excellent, AMERICAN MADE, nothing imported","I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called ""made here."" I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.<br />This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.<br />My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them. At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control, but now months on this food NO TARTAR. At all, and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time. His doggy breath has never been better. If I could give this food 10 stars, I would. I'd recommend this food for toy breeds as well as giant breeds.<br />It used to be when I opened a bag of food I'd keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky. Not this food, now, I'm not saying I want a mouthful, but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods. You can actually smell the herbs they use.<br />This product is on my wish list at Amazon. Anyone who wants to get me a good gift, get me a bag. It is definately a gift I'll use!"
07	19576,B000084ETV,A3DAXM59DANA8Z,1/28/07,7,7,5,The best product for the price,"After reading the book ""Deadly Feasts"" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog's sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!"

07	19579,B000084ETV,AH5NKAG8839T8,12/18/07,15,18,1,Something's Changed with Canidae food,"I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed.  My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it.  Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week-- same results.  Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.  I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats."

I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."

The 5 ounce packages are paper reinforced cylinders, easy to pack and easy to open, great for a take-along treat.  (The packs don't re-close, however, so you pretty much have to devour all contents once opened.)  For Christmas I made up small gift baskets using these, a coffee mug or two, and some instant cappucino."

She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.<br /><br />2. This 12-pound, high-energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40-pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7/month for food. Canidae may cost more than better-known brands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy-like."

As many people know Jacks are an extemely active breed and keeping weight on them can be a problem.  We were feeding Flint River, a very high quality food,  both of my jacks were getting 2 cups a day just to maintain a slightly below average weight. My papillon was at the proper weight but still getting 1.5 cups of flint river a day.  We decided to switch foods and after much debate we chose canidae.  During the time it took to slowly switch foods(14 days) my jacks had already gained weight and were looking much better.  After 3 weeks we had to reduce their food becuase they were getting fat!  now my jacks eat 1/2 a cup twice daily and they have never looked better.  My papillon eats 1/4 cup AM and 1/2 cup PM.  Just the reduction in food alone has saved so much money.  Because we are feeding less there is less poop to clean up.  I really cannot say enough about this food its has made my dogs more balanced mentally and physically."

I read some of the negative reviews for fun, and all I can say is these are from Europe - where they eat more butter, drink more, smoke and live longer than we do in the US.  If you like the icing on cakes or Oreo cookies you probably won't like these.  They're sweet, but in the European sense of the word. That means you'll actually taste something besides eye-watering sweetness.  I love these cookies with a good LaVazza coffee in the morning. Or afternoon."

One reviewer compared them to Oreos.  DON'T.  There is no comparison.  The biscuit is mild chocolate and the cream is not a thick tasteless glob; it's a really delicious vanilla cream filling.  I highly recomment these in either variety -- chocolate biscuit with vanilla filling, or vanilla biscuit with chocolate filling.  My family love them."

I purchase all three flavors and eat whatever I'm in the mood for, and I enjoy all of them (chocolate, pb, berry).  Bottom line, try a box purchased locally, and if you like them, buy them by the case at amazon for their cheaper price.  My only complaint is that Amazon grocery doesn't consistently carry the chocolate flavor.  If Amazon grocery is to thrive, customers need to know they can find the products they want to buy on a consistent basis."

However, knew I needed more protein, and I thought I would try to use TVP to get additional healthy vegetable protein into my diet.  I now sprinkle it on yogurt, over a bowl of berries, I use it as a binder in my turkey meatloaf instead of breadcrumbs, and I add it to a bowl of cereal.  Using this as a part of a healthy diet helped me to lose 25 lbs in 12 weeks!<br /><br />It has very little taste, but if used in its natural form (right out of the bag) it adds a nice crunch."

Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire."

I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"

The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best."

Then I bought 2 more boxes!<br /><br />So why only 4 stars? There's a reason I got them for as little as I did. They're from 2003. I bought them in 2006. That's not something I expected from Amazon. And a lot of the cookies came broken from rough handling. So I knocked off a star. Still tasted great. And I'm still alive.

He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade."

07	51186,B000O2EBGI,A1SKNPNU6MRC94,12/3/07,4,4,5,Wow!! What a difference in 2 weeks & my kitties love it!,"I have two senior, indoor cats. Before I introduced Wellness into their diet they were both vomiting almost every day for a month. My vet ran tests but found nothing remarkable. The next step would have been x-rays. I was perplexed and worried about my little ones. Although I did not order this food as a ""cure,"" my newfound awareness of my cats' sensitive digestive systems and what was going into their food drove me to seek another alternative to the Iams Indoor Weight and Hairball Control catfood I was feeding them. They were also hacking up constant fur balls despite the special catfood and daily brushing.<br /><br />My cats have not vomited once in the 2 weeks since I switched them to this catfood! They seem to have more energy too. As if that weren't enough, I have not seen one hairball. Their coats are gorgeous, thicker, shinier and those dry flakes are gone. They are shedding less - when I go to brush them there is less fur in the comb. These are the results after only 2 weeks! I am very impressed with these Wellness products and I am picky about what I give to my furry children. Of course my vet continues to push the Science diet (which my cats hate) and Eukanuba, telling me about the ""tests and trials"" these brands have run that no other brands have, but I believe nature equipped my cats with good instincts about what they should and should not eat. They love this food and it appears to love them back. I feel good about the ingredients. I will continue to give it to my babies along with the Wellness Healthy Weight Formula and the Wellness canned catfood."

Like everything, moderation is key, and then it's fine to eat these. Obviously if you sit there and eat a whole package every day for a week, that isn't very healthy.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are expecting American style cookies, then you will be disappointed. These are not the same in the least. These are made with what they call Biscuits in Europe. They are *slightly* sweetened, almost cracker like in texture. The frosting is not made out of crisco and sugar like American cookies are, so it's not all oily and disgusting. But it also tastes VERY different. The cocoa is not super strong, but it's a nice compliment to the biscuit portion.<br /><br />If you're used to sickening sweet cookies, then you'll probably think these taste weird.<br /><br />Personally I love these because they are more subtle in flavor and not so sweet it makes my teeth hurt. They're really good with tea."

07	44943,B000LKV4QI,A1I34N9LFOSCX7,11/6/07,3,14,3,raisins are HARD AS ROCKS...................,and they aren't softening in the milk. you will need strong healthy teeth to chomp on them.  the cereal itself sops up a lot of milk & it expands quite a bit (so don't pour too big a bowl like i did. now i'm trying to stuff it all down). There is the occasional really hard nugget of grain mixed in. when i come across one it tends to jam into my cavity & is a little uncomfortable.  but for the most part the cereal is soft & easily chewed just like mashed up wheaties.<br /><br />  Honestly this tasted strange to me on the first couple bites but as i sit here enjoying my first bowl i'm getting used to it.  before i bit in i thought i detected a weird smell.  i think it's just the way one or more of the grains smells & i wasn't familiar with the scent of that particular grain. or maybe cause they are sprouted they smell different. OR perhaps the addition of cinnamon did it. if so it's the only time i smelled something w/cinnamon that didn't smell better w/the cinnamon added.<br /><br />  in summary i think this is a pretty good cereal for those into super healthy foods.  The average person looking to add some whole grains could do a lot better in the taste & texture departments. If you are interested in sprouted grains specifically then i can't say for sure as this is the only sprouted grain cereal i've ever had.  I think i may try another box but next time i'll get the one with almond slivers. perhaps those flavors will be more complementary. and i'll bet the almonds are softer than the raisins.......i'll be sure to review it once i try it!

They are chocolatey and you can taste the coconut and nuts, but they are not sickeningly sweet like most coconut & chocolate bars.  Plus they are moist and the size of the bar is just right. If you are expecting a candy bar type item you will be disappointed - this is not dipped in chocolate, rather the chocolate is mixed right in.  But if you're looking for a healthy snack that energizes you without the sugar burnout you get from other 'energy' bars then these are worth a try.

07	78602,B00472I5A4,AJQD2WWJYOYFQ,8/8/07,0,0,4,"Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!","Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."
07	78601,B00472I5A4,ABR7HU5H1KNE,12/3/07,0,0,5,Best Chip Ever,"This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had.  Look at the ingredients:  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper.  How can you go wrong?<br /><br />Obviously, not for you if you don't like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, you'll probably love these.  They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food."

They are supposed to taste like Peanut-Butter Rice Krispie Treats.  They are much lighter as far as a ""bar"" goes - reminds me of eating those round rice-poof cakes.  They taste...decent.  The first part and last part of the bite is good; somewhere around the middle to end you get a funny taste.  No bad aftertaste though.  They are nice to have in case you get hungry and need to avoid stuff with gluten in it.  All I can say is give it a try and see if you like them.  I can see kids liking them a lot more than adults too."
07	70868,B000E4ALGK,A19GDSAXNKHVGS,8/31/07,4,4,5,Nothing wrong with these!,"I was surprised to see that people don't like these.  I don't have kids, but I buy them for myself because they're gluten free.  I like that they're not too sweet, and relatively low in calories and fat compared to many bars out there.  A tasty snack to have around.  I'd like a little more PB flavor, but at least they're not loaded with sugar."

07	36132,B000FBQ594,AC1NNWMSGWD2L,6/24/07,1,1,5,Just right,"These cookies aren't too sweet/sugary on the taste buds. So you can give it to your kids (or yourself) and not worry about them getting hyper.<br /><br />The thing about buying food over Amazon is that the expiration date is only like 2 months away. Plan to split the food and costs with someone, it'll help. Or put it in the break room for your coworkers, that's what I do."

For the amount of calories and fat you consume for each cookie, it really isn't worth it. I didn't find them to be very sweet either. They kind of reminded me of a biscuit type cookie which isn't what I was expecting. I'm sure some people will love them, they're just not for me."
07	36137,B000FBQ594,A1TWO81SR5XJST,6/10/07,2,3,4,Very tasty but a bit too sweet for me,"First, I have to admit these cookies are very tasty.  It's like an indulgence.  But at 140 calories for 2 cookies, I have to watch how much I eat.  There are probably around 12 cookies in 1 pack.  These cookies are a bit too sweet for me but I'm the type of person that doesn't eat too much sweets.  The chocolately cocoa crackers are very crunchy, not too hard, not too soft and the filling is like a marshmallow texture but it's not marshmallow, it's a creamy vanilla filling.  It doesn't ooze out when you take a bite into it. (That's a plus for me because it keeps my hands clean.)  Overall, very good.  They should make them in low-cal and low-fat versions. :)"

I love them but I resisted when I was shopping for Christmas.  BUT, when I saw them for 25 packages for $12.00 with free shipping - I caved.  OK- they are not low fat but one splurge a year won't kill us."

When I saw that Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6),<br /><br />was on Amazon.com, I said goodbye to the real world, and hello to the guy with the big package.  I would advise everyone to throw their lives away and click the ""buy this product"" for Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) immediatly, if not sooner.<br /><br />While they are at it they should go and buy Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and also Amish Style Roll Butter to compliment your Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), with Ener-G Foods Papa's Loaf, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6) (for your Amish Style Roll Butter, of course.)<br /><br />I can personally say that this is easy to make, first you place your Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) into a thing of boiling water.  Then you grab your Ener-G Foods Papa's Loaf, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6), then grab your Amish Style Roll Butter and spread on about 8 ounces of this bad boy.  Then grab a cup and pour in some Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, for delicious whole milk flavor of course.<br /><br />I also can personally say that Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), saved my family.  My husband was beginning to get aggravated from having to actually go over to Flow's food for his Annie's Homegrown Wisconsin Cheddar Microwavable Mac & Cheese, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), then we saw it on Amazon.com, and we've been happily married for five hours.<br /><br />So in conclusion, buy this item immediately, who needs a life when you have Amazon.com?"

An easy meal to make when you need something quick but don't want to give them fast food.  It is very hot after it's prepared, but throw in some frozen peas, mix it up, and it's a ready-to-eat healthy meal.  Great to have on hand, and the price at amazon beats anything I've found in my local stores."

When my local grocery stores (all of them!) stopped selling this variety of Bigelow tea about four years ago, I searched high and low for a replacement, to no avail. You can't just add cinnamon to regular black tea. Herbal cinnamon teas do not taste the same. Nothing else can compare to Bigelow's cinnamon stick tea. Then I found the tea online through Amazon, and I ordered three cases of six 20-count boxes. That's 360 bags of tea, enough for half a year if I ration myself to two cups a day, which is hard to do. You get the picture ... I'm crazy about this tea. Try it, you'll be glad you did."

The kids have been eating it, but they say that there is a slightly weird aftertaste.  When prepared following the directions, the noodles sometimes aren't quite cooked, and the water ratio isn't quite right --- sometimes ending up with inadequate water to make the sauce. Perhaps that's my microwave, but I haven't noticed this problem with other foods.  The powder sauce packet doesn't mix well even with the hot bits of water, leaving clumps.  The pluses --- quick to make, kids will eat it (sometimes), portions are small -- perfect for a preschooler, requires no milk or added oil.  We are satisfied for the amount we paid, but not likely to purchase again, unless there is a promotion or sale."

I am living in Japan (US Military) and I was ordering my dog food from PetCo online.  I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.  It is just not right to feed our pets the crap that they sell in the stores.  I used to think that Eukanuba was a great dog food.  Thank God for the Internet!<br /><br />Buy this food, you will not be disappointed!"

It is pretty straightforward, definitely not a ""complex"" tea. It tastes mainly of strawberry, but there are other flavors in there as well.

The price is very fair.  I bought 6 boxes and the price total for each box and shipping were close to the grocery price I had been paying.  Another, YEAH!!  I will order again and again.  It took less than 48 hours to arrive once my order had been placed.  This was way above your 5 star rating!!!"

My little kitten is as healthy as can be.  She is now gaining good amounts of weight, but not getting plump.  It is not like other cat foods that are like McDonalds for pets.  No sudden highs and lows after eating.  I thought pet food was just pet food, but I will never change this food for my pets. It is so amazing!!!  Give it a few weeks and you will see the same."

It is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot!"
07	19597,B000084ETV,A157NH3OJD4WDG,8/13/07,3,3,5,Excellent quality food at an excellent price.,"Canidae is an excellent food that is meat based and is great for people who are looking for a top quality dog food, but don't want to break the bank. I know a lot of people who can not afford dog food that is extremely expensive, and yet they don't want to feed cheap fillers or grain based foods. If you are a person on a tight budget Canidae is worth a try. You will notice a big difference in energy as well as skin and coat. A lot of senior dogs switch to the ALS formula and have more zoomies and more energy than on other lower quality diets. Canidae is worth every penny."

However, it was poorly executed. When you use the recomended amount of water, its to water, even after 10 mintues of sitting. Too little, your noodles will clump together and get undercooked.

It is probably 4 out of every 5 tea bags that I use.  I have been a tea drinker for many years, and this is, by far, my favorite.  Very few of the major brands offer a cinnamon flavored tea in tea bags.  Whenever I have found them, I have tried them.  None are equal to Bigalow Cinnamon Stick.<br /><br />  These tea bags do not overwhelm you with a spicy flavor, as some others do.  The cinnamon is subtle, and adds to the smoothness of the quality black tea that is the basis of this brand.  I usually drink this tea hot and black.  But in the summer I add ice and sugar for a very refreshing and different iced tea.<br /><br />  Thank you Amazon for offering this hard to find tea in a six pack of boxes, at a discount price."

The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)"

I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies."

I mix it with rice or almond milk and it's good to go.  As a treat I'll blend it with some frozen fruit when he's hankering for ice cream or sweets.  It's nice knowing on the days when he won't eat one green vegetable that he is covered nutritionally.
07	78516,B000BQVS0E,A4KMNJQRE5TO3,7/2/07,1,1,5,my baby loves this,"This formula totally saved us during the transition from nursing. My third had strong allergies to soy and dairy and when we discoved this fabulous product we were totally relieved. He loves the taste and is still asking for it at 2 1/2 years old. The ingredients have been carefully chosen and I appreciate the high nutritional value and clean product list. For moms just trying it out, be patient as the babies take a few tries to get used to the texture. we have really relied on this product and highly recommend it."

When I went back to get more, they didn't carry it anymore.  I've looked all over Dallas for this stuff and no one carries it.  It is the only supplement/formula/protein powder that our 2 year old WILL eat and CAN eat.  She is allergic to dairy, wheat, and eggs.  She loves it and will drink it to the exclusion of everything else, including juice.  It's worth every penny!!  Thanks for carrying everything under the sun, Amazon!"

Subconsciously it began a profound quest within him in the field of prevention and wellness medicine.<br /><br />In 1993, Dr. Visser was seeing about 100 patients a day at his clinic.  His clinic, Visser Wellness & Research Center is based on treating people holistically.<br /><br />As a last resort many times, moms would come in to see if he could help their children, who oftentimes, suffered from chronic upper respiratory diseases, poor nutrition, ADD, ADHD and poor or slow developments physically and/or psychologically.  Dr. Visser started noticing a pattern in these kids -  allergies to dairy, soy and high sugar products.  This started for him a journey in seeing what could be done.  With his TV show ""Wild Medicine"", Dr. Visser was able to travel around the world and work with some of the best minds in the fields of wellness.<br /><br />The obesity epidemic as well as the nutrient deficient children worldwide in both poor and rich countries became painfully obvious.  This is when Dr. Visser and his wife Lin and with the birth of their own child, Kai starting delving deeper into the issue.  A trailbrazer in childhood obesity research, Dr. Visser is continually on the forefront of addressing kids' evolving developmental needs and raising the awareness of proper guidance, movement and nutrition for healthy and fit toddlers and children. Through his recent clinical research on 10,000 children and the obesity pandemic, Dr. Visser has identified a great need for new nutritional options for toddlers.<br /><br />Dr. Visser embarked on the journey to fill the need for alternative options to dairy, soy, high sugar content foods for parents.  In 2000, he started actively putting together a team of healthcare professionals to develop the most innovative and nutritious product line for toddlers and children.  With the latest study findings at University of Minnesota, his own research and the guidance of FDA scientist consultants, TODDLER HEALTH product line was created.<br /><br />The product is designed to eliminate the concerns of parents with regard to the nutrient deficient eating habits and to address the obesity threat that kids face today.<br /><br />This project is from the heart.  Healthy Children make Happy Parents!  Thank you for reading ""our story"" and have a healthy, happy day!<br /><br />Dr. Richard Visser, Phd<br /><br />Lin Young  Visser"

I think it is excellent though it is not cheap.  The leaves look in excellent shape and only a spoonful is needed in a teapot.  I made the mistake of using too much tea for my first pot but this is a tasty tea."
07	29766,B000GFYRIK,A2UVYN2FO7X43V,2/6/07,4,4,5,Best Tea Ever,"Ok, I'm very biased.  I love this tea.  I've been drinking it since high school or even earlier for over [mumble, mumble] twenty years.  When the stores in my area stopped carrying it, I went to Amazon.  Great price -- and I can get six boxes at a time.  Great for the tea addict.<br /><br />No, it's not as trendy as some of the other teas out there, but it's smooth and not acidic.  It has a nice cinnamon flavor -- not overpoweringly so either.  It's not sweet like many of the orange and cinnamon teas I've tried but couldn't choke down.  A very smooth, palatable tea."
07	29767,B000GFYRIK,A29DL4TKY8W79N,1/12/07,4,4,5,My Favorite Tea,This is my all-time favorite tea.  There is a nice hint of cinnamon that is great at any time of day.  I can easily go through 4 of these teabags a day.  Probably 90 percent of the hot tea I drink is Bigelow Cinnamon Stick Tea.  I've tried other cinnamon teas and by far this is the best one yet.  Thank you Bigelow and thank you Amazon.com for carrying this--and in bulk.

07	59353,B000FBM3RC,A1SB8CXAUIKT8X,8/1/07,3,3,5,Light and Tasty!,The Bahlsen Delobas are my favorite so far. Call them biscuits or call them cookies they are just plain good. Light and pastry like with a nice burst of sweetness from the red current jam. Try Them!
07	59354,B000FBM3RC,A2PBMSX1ATJSBD,7/29/07,3,3,5,Delicious!,"I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately."
07	59355,B000FBM3RC,A1SB8CXAUIKT8X,7/15/07,3,3,5,Very Good!,Great texture and balance of sweet to butter is just about right. Adults and kids both love them. Recommended
07	59356,B000FBM3RC,A2RFJYQ08USWOG,1/14/07,7,9,5,These cookies are $2.19 in my SuperMarket,We were buying Bahlsen cookies at $1.70-$2.19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are $1.41/box here at Amazon!
07	84467,B000ETAJZ8,A2WNWOK8MMZG15,5/19/07,0,0,5,Great for everyone in the family.,"Both my kids (8 and 4) love these cookies.  They have always been really crunchy.  We've never had them mushy like in another review.  They are not too sweet and have fun shapes.  Great for anyone gluten sensitive, and everyone else in the family."
07	2990,B0011X5S8Y,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,1/3/07,1,2,4,"Fun, Intense Holiday Tea","****<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings' Sugar Plum Spice is a delightful holiday tea. It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use ""natural flavors"" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called ""effervescent decaffeination"" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, ""Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness."" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.<br /><br />****"
07	84466,B000ETAJZ8,AXXF23I3GZ4F0,11/13/07,0,0,5,A favorite of my autistic son,"Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade."
07	46071,B001EO5QZK,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,8/8/07,2,2,4,Good Basic Tea,"****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****"
07	70817,B000E4ALGU,A1GHOO7HF2XND1,9/14/07,0,1,5,Great Bars,They have a juicy flavor I really liked. I go through about 2 boxes a week. Will definately be purchasing more.

Do you like serious heat in your food (i.e. Dave's insanity sauce)?  Then you'll love this spicy popcorn.<br /><br />Just be sure to share this with other people who can handle the heat.  It'd certainly be a waste to toss half a bag of this popcorn.
07	49594,B001E5E268,A2HIMA1WC68O2O,6/28/07,0,0,4,Honest Brew,"Stash have tried very hard to get quality product for the consumers.

We have tried various ""bars"" that were ""safe"" for her to eat and this has been, by far, her favorite! I'm happy that they're organic & she loves the taste. Great all around. They are individually packaged, which makes them great for when we are on the go."

In the local grocery store, they are SOOO expensive, about $5 per box ---- so this is a STEAL! I'm stocking up because I hate to be without a ""Tiger Bar"" during a long commute from work with my son.... I feel better knowing that they're so good for him, or at least, they're not bad like most snacks are. It's nice to have something in my purse or in the car when he needs a snack. They're the best!"
07	70807,B000E4ALGU,A26LO3KVCC5ZGQ,11/17/07,0,0,5,Taste great,I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet. I also like to buy from reputable companies. So it is hard to find products that meet my criteria. But I found these bars that meet it and also taste great. And on top of all I like the fact that the company donates a percentage of their profits.
07	70806,B000E4ALGU,AF4RMNZ0OLHG1,11/27/07,0,0,4,Good Gluten-Free Snack,"This is a good gluten-free snack.  My son likes the berry flavor best, and from what I have tasted, I would agree.  My son is gluten-free, so snacks are a challenge, but he likes this and it is not so expensive as some other alternatives."

It is pretty straightforward, definitely not a ""complex"" tea. It tastes mainly of strawberry, but there are other flavors in there as well.

The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same."

When I mixed the batter according to the package directions, it appeared WAAAY too thick to possibly make pancakes.  Sooooo... I added and added and added liquid until it seemed like pancake consistency.  DO NOT DO THIS!  That first batch, although the crumbs tasted just fine, didn't hold together, couldn't be flipped without the entire thing falling apart, and frankly made a huge mess.  Entirely my fault, admittedly.  I plan to try using it for pizza dough and deep-fry coating soon."

This is easily one of the best values I've found for bulk almond extract. The seller is reliable and ships very fast and I will most likely purchase more in the future."

I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!"

They were two cherries on a stem and sour!  I got there and they were tasty (and being Haribo--Swedish) but not very sour.  I sucked on the candies for awhile and once the sugary coating was off the gummy inside was more sour, but still the wrong candies.

Well recently, for reasons I haven't been able to ascertain, Whole foods stopped carrying it.<br /><br />I have always liked YA-YA's Chedder flavor because they don't overwhelm you with cheese. The big fat American eater probably wont like it. It is low fat and lightly cheese flavored and frankly, it doesn't have the mouth feel that that the unhealth concience eater wants.<br /><br />If you are aware of what your eating, this popcorn is a nice treat. Popcorn is neat food for blood sugar control. Popcorn will not cause an insulin spike. This particular popcorn does not contain Trans Fat. No<br />patially hydrogenated oil. Check your microwave popcorn. Its loaded with it and should never be eaten under any circumstance.<br /><br />So, eat your YA-YA's! I do wish amazon could get it out faster.

She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.

The flavor is very smooth, has a creamy head and ends with a slight bitternes. This is a great beer to start with for new brewers and veterans alike. If you are to anxious to wait for it to age, you can drink it after 2 weeks. It will taste good, but get better with age. Make sure to put it in the fridge after it carbonates.

I am a dealer and own and operate a pet boarding facility.  I switch dogs everyday to Canidae without mixing diets due to the nature of the business and it saves me tons in labor.  The dogs not only gobble it up - they do not get upset tummies.  I have been feeding my pack of competitive working dogs (Border Collies and Australian Shepherds) for 6 years and about 30 boarding dogs per day and I have not found anything even close to the quality and value of Canidae.  Many kennels try to cut corners on feed but I believe paying a little more for Canidae has made money.  The dogs feel great, the kennels stay clean, and the owners have peace of mind. (Less poop to scoop is a big deal around here) I am a strong supporter of any feed company that puts together an all natural - excellent ingredient product and have tried many, but I'm completely sold on Canidae."

07	78327,B00064VQO4,A2UVPDFQEB8Z9R,10/16/07,73,78,5,The Great Olive Oil Scandal and why you should use Bariani,"The problem with most of today's olive oil is that it is rarely produced in the old way, which is more time consuming and expensive. Due to the increasing demand for olive oil, the trend has been to reduce production costs by moving toward more automation and concentration of production in ever larger installations. These modem factories extract more oil more cheaply, but their processing methods substantially reduce the nutritional quality of the oil.<br /><br />To reduce costs, olives are machine harvested along with leaves and twigs. Olives that have dropped on the ground, which can be said to contain bad oil, are often mixed with the good ones. They are shipped in all kinds of containers, many of which are poorly ventilated, and heaped in large piles where the olives are stored for too long and often become moldy. The oil is then extracted in a continuous centrifuge where hot water is used to help separate out the oil.<br /><br />Antioxidant polyphenols are soluble in water and are washed away in this process, thereby lowering the shelf life and the nutritional quality of the oil. Italy alone produces 800,000 cubic meters of waste water per year from this process. Because substantial amounts of antioxidants are washed away, factory produced olive oils have a short shelf life of only months, whereas real olive oil lasts for two to three years.<br /><br />Most people think that by purchasing ""extra virgin"" olive oil they are getting a high quality oil.  Unfortunately, in most cases, this is not true. It's more complex than that. A label reading extra virgin is no guarantee of quality. For one thing, nowhere does it say that extra virgin olive oil has to be made 100% from olives.<br /><br />Lower quality oils can be refined to bring the acidity down so they can be labeled as extra virgin. But now the oil has been refined, and that's not what you want. That's why being labeled extra virgin is no guarantee of getting high quality oil, which has not been processed in ways that reduce its nutritional value. To complicate matters even more, the term ""extra virgin"" has no official meaning in the United States. The U.S. is not a member of the International Olive Oil Council. So, olive oil sold here can be labeled extra virgin without meeting the accepted international standards.<br /><br />Another reason why you can't trust extra virgin olive oil is exemplified by a problem that manifested last year, and may turn out to be the biggest food fraud of the 20th Century. Despite the fact that details of this scandal have been published in Merum, a Swiss-German magazine, and in Italian journals such as Agra Trade, and the newspaper Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, this information has been successfully suppressed and is known to only a handful. Investigators are gathering evidence indicating that the biggest olive oil brands in Italy have for years been systematically diluting their extra virgin olive oil with cheap, highly-refined hazelnut oil imported from Turkey. International arrest warrants have been issued and so far documents indicate that at least ten thousand tons of hazelnut oil are involved. As much as 20% hazelnut oil can be added to olive oil and still be undetectable to the consumer. In fact olive oil labeled ""Italian"" often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece. Considering what has happened in Europe, where there are strict regulations, imagine what can happen in California where there are no regulations. Apparently, more oil is ""produced"" in California than there are olives available. The truth is, most of the extra virgin olive oil on the market does not supply all the nutritional value and health giving properties that we have a right to expect from olive oil.<br /><br />The bottom line is that modem, factory-produced olive oil has been stripped of its health enhancing nutrients, and the task of selecting a high quality oil has been made very difficult.<br /><br />Bariani olive oil is produced by the Bariani family on a small farm in the central valley of California. Their olives are grown without pesticides.  They are hand picked from the trees, carefully washed and dried, and milled with a stone wheel within 48 hours of harvesting. It is pressed in a hydraulic press, collected in stainless steel vats, decanted, and bottled.  This first cold pressed oil is the real stuff and retains all the natural flavor and goodness."

The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away.

Pour it over your favorite sugar-free ice cream (mine is mint chocolate chip), and you can enjoy a treat fit for a king or queen (diabetic or not) without having to watch your blood sugar go crazy.  Thank you, Hershey's, for making such a WONDERFUL product !!!"
07	17165,B000EH0RU2,A38XW5668UKIJ6,1/13/07,7,7,5,TASTES GREAT but overpriced,"On one of my ""we've got to start eating more healthy"" days, I saw this product.  I, personally like brown rice, etc., but I have a family that for the most part thinks anything healthy doesn't taste good.  I ordered it and served it and everyone liked it.  Even my most staunch ""I hate healthy food"" critic, my teenaged son admitted he liked it.  My only complaint would be the price which I think is too high and when you add shipping it becomes a luxury item. Healthy, complete grains that haven't been processed should be cheaper than their processed counterparts, or at least closer in price.  It's so much cheaper to eat unhealthy.  Still if you want something good for you and tastes good, try this."

I find it much ""twiggier"" for lack of a better descriptor, and not NEARLY as sweet and good as it was before. I'm going to buy another box to make sure that this isn't totally random, but this was the case with two boxes I bought, one of Original and one of Original Decaf. Other friends of mine have noticed this as well; I really hope they didn't change the formula because it is/was my favorite tea and I don't like what I'm tasting now!"

My 6 year old sheltie has allergies and I have been feeding him natural and/or organic foods for the past year, in an effort to eliminate things in his diet to find out what he is allergic too. I tried a few different natural and organic brands but he did not like them. Since I tried the Natural Ultramix, he eagerly eats it on his own without me having to sit down with him to eat. (Yes, I Know.... he is spoiled rotten) He also is doing better with the allergy problem and his coat is getting better. I would highly recommend this dog food for anyone who cares about what their dogs are eating. No By Products, No Fillers, No Wheat and No Corn. All of these can be harmful to your dog."

I bought these at the request of a friend of mine whose husband loves them, so I bought myself a bag too. They are a little too chewy for my taste, but my friend and her husband just love them.

Though of course that's a good thing in chips, but I have never tasted any other chips like these. You simply can not compare these to chips like Lay's or other national brands.  They are just salt and pepper and potato.  You don't taste grease or manufactured flavors.  They are crispy, but NOT hard to chew or too crunchy.  totally perfect.  Buy them, but be prepared to eat way too much.  Though one complaint that I didn't have - someone who tried them wished they had more pepper.  But I think they are perfect as is."

The cookies were very good and they are individually wrapped so he could put them in his back pack (or hide them in his dorm room) and there was no mess.  I would not order them again only because it took too long for them to arrive which is most likely Amazon's problem. The cookies were Great just too late.<br /><br />I will buy Mrs. Fields cookies again and send them to my son, just not through Amazon."

The chocolate cookies taste a lot like the plain cookies but does lend a bit of chocolatey-ness to the overall flavor. The creme center is an average white creme filling like you would find in an Oreo.<br /><br />Basically, this is the less-subtle cousin to the nuanced original. It's much sweeter. But I have to ask, why not just eat an oreo?"

I bought this and out of the box it was pretty until I looked close and found it was infested with tiny white bugs that clung to nearly every branch and leaf.  I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die.  I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs.  The plant died two weeks later.  I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent.

It's definitely not like Kraft nor Road's End, but there's something distinctly cheese-like about it and I found it to be delicious!  I added both peas and broccoli and was pleasantly suprised to find that the cheese sauce was plentiful enough for all of the pasta, peas, and broc.  I also must say, as my first time trying to cook gluten-free pasta on my own, this was painless and didn't crumble apart (like it could have).  I gave it 4 stars, not quite perfect, but definitely a great treat (every once in awhile, for those of us on a budget)."

The chocolate ballotins arrived in TWO days without express delivery. Thanks to fresh product and fine packaging the chocolates could not have arrived as they did: in perfect shape.

That's why I was happy to find these available on Amazon. It is a very strong flavor, not sugared up for general consumption.  If you're a fan of the instense flavors found in Altoids, you'll appreciate Chimes.  The peanut butter may cut the bitterness of ginger, but in no way distracts from the intense flavor.  And when the candy is gone, you have a nifty tin for sewing notions, little bits of hardware, or any sundry of small things in need of a sturdy box in which to hold them."

It is easy to prepare, just follow the box. And stir every few minutes so the bottom doesn't get stuck or burnt. A pound of chicken sounded like alot, but it is needed to balance out the seasoning. I tried it with less chicken but it was not as good.<br /><br />Just add your own chicken and water. I skipped the butter as the chicken had just enough of its own fat."

The sauce was not smooth and was spicy (not hot-spicy, but strong-flavored spicy). My kids were appalled by it and while my husband and I could eat it, we didn't really like it. Since I bought a case, we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta. I would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can, otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family doesn't like this unusual flavor."

My baby loves these (she's not been spoiled by others kinds) and my older boys don't care for them.  they prefer other kinds of chips.  I think if you start them very young or try them later once the kids are old enough to grasp the idea of nutrition - they'll be a big hit.  I personally prefer the taste of these over other brands and other types of salty, crunchy snacks."

Usually, I'm not a fan of crunchy cookies, even if they ARE from the delectable Pepperidge Farm bakery.<br /><br />But I decided to try these buttery treats and let me tell you...I am not disappointed! (In fact, I'm munching on them right now.) They are so buttery--so melt in your mouth--they'd be *perfect* with coffee, tea, or hot chocolate--but I tend to snatch them when I need a snack because I haven't eaten all day. (I know...bad habit!)<br /><br />And, this may sound corny, they are beautiful to look at! Not only do these cookies have a raised chess emblem on the front, but they are also washed with eggwhites. (I can tell because of the glistening, golden color!)<br /><br />Rook, Bishop, Queen and Knight--they're all here in buttery brilliance!<br /><br />So if you're in the mood for a fantastic butter cookie, you will LOVE Chessmen from Pepperidge Farm. (And if your favorite soldier or student loves chess--and cookies--this would make a great addition to any care package!)"
07	72996,B004P7QDH8,A2R6RA8FRBS608,5/27/07,1,1,5,I've Given My Heart To These Pepperidge Farm Cookies !!!,"Pepperidge Farm has a long history of making premium quality cookies; and these ""Chessmen"" butter cookies are certainly no exception. They contain no artificial flavors, no preservatives and they are crunchy but oh, so wonderfully smooth as you roll them around in your mouth before you swallow them. Awesome!<br /><br />Another reviewer notes that they are aesthetically pleasing; and that reviewer is correct. The cookies have four chessmen on them--you get the rook, the bishop, the queen and the knight--this enhances the appeal of the product. Yes, chess players will love that; but just about anyone who enjoys a good cookie can appreciate these butter cookies. Even if butter cookies aren't your personal favorite, you will fall for these ones--they're THAT good!<br /><br />The cookies are kosher, if that matters to you; and they are certainly designed tastefully enough that you can serve them as snacks for any company you may have visiting you. One caveat, however--these cookies do contain sugar and some fat; and the sugar could convert to extra fat in your body if you are not too active. If sugar and/or fat content pose dietary concerns for you then I would ask a doctor before eating these cookies.<br /><br />Overall, obviously, these cookies are just about the best and they will remain some of the best because of the classic Pepperidge Farm high level of quality control. Buy a bag or two and enjoy some tonight!  SMILES"

But now they are NOT AVAILABLE??  The only thing Amazon is selling it variety packs which include 3 kinds: these, almond chocolate bars (good) and the caramel bars, which I don't like.  Therefore, I guess I will be onto other web sites looking to buy these Chocolate Peanut ones.  Oh, Amazon, you have failed me!"

Amazingly there is not much of a price difference (12-9.5oz for 33.36 vs. 12-8.5 oz. for 29.83)to purchase the better quality cracker. If the coupon offer is in effect, then these crackers are also the price winner! The only disadvantage is since I think these are healthy, I eat more of them at one time than I would normally of the other brand. They are sooooo tasty w/ melted cheddar cheese on top or warmed crab dip. Enjoy!"

I imagine letting them hang for a really long time (months) would be detrimental, but I never managed to let them hang for more than a week or 2.

The price here was much lower. Take a chance on these cookies. I, for health reasons, started eating natural and organic foods. Treats like Nana's cookies fit nicely in to my diet. My favorite is Oatmeal, Raisin. The taste is amazing. I would recommend to anyone. Yum!"

The stuff is fantastic!  It is slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so.  It has a little zing (at least the extra hot one does) and it adds a lot of flavor, especially to curry dishes.  I doused my curry chicken with it and it is a fabulous combination.<br /><br />What a great condiment.  And much cheaper to buy from Amazon than have to send to South Africa for it!"

They do a great job with packaging and shipping!  Most of my orders have shipped the same day I ordered.<br /><br />I have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed.

I fell in love with it.  Alas, I had only brought one bottle home with me.  This was pre-Internet, so there was no more to be had.  Now I can get it again!<br /><br />It really is a delicious chutney, hot and smooth by comparison with others such as mild and chunky Major Grey's (a very good chutney of a different type).  It's flavor is just right, not too heavy handed with the strong spices, like cloves, which can leave a tinny aftertaste, but enough heat to make you sit up and take notice.<br /><br />If you're new to chutney and like things a bit spicy, give this a try.  It's not only good with curries, but it's excellent as a spread with cream cheese and, thinned with a little juice, makes a delicious baste for a pork roast.  Great product."
07	2118,B00061EXBU,A143VWWW5CGG2S,3/27/07,4,12,5,To wash my record collection,"I bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity.  I have a VPI record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection.  You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent.  This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities.  You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned.  My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD ""It just sounds more alive""---she says.  This water is highly recommended for this purpose.  I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about."

07	70583,B000FNB3AI,A3MTRFKMYQNF7,6/16/07,4,5,4,Tasty cookie -- even fiance likes it..,"These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say ""one"" cookie, then ""half"" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth."

I mixed it with soymilk and it tasted like pea-flavored chalk.  I thought I might have used too much powder so I tried half the amount of powder and it still tasted the same.  Not wanting to give up, I mixed in a scoop of strawberry flavored whey protein and it truly tasted like a combination of strawberry and chalk.<br /><br />My fiancee then tried it and couldn't take more than a sip.  In the end, I was able to down three cups of it, but I don't think I can drink any more in the future. I am going to take them up on their money back product guarantee."

07	10570,B000PSNJXC,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,9/25/07,1,1,5,"Romantic, Natural, Unique Tea Experience","*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. It isn't too sugary - it's just right! In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious."

Nana's no gluten cookies have by far the most consistent texture of any gluten free cookies that I have tried (including my own homemade).  They are hardly distinguishable from a wheat-based cookie.  They are extremely soft, and, accordingly, some flavors do tend to be a tad ""crumbly"", e.g. ginger.  Lemon is not crumbly."
07	70565,B000FNB3AI,A2VG3F7CA6O9QZ,5/1/07,5,5,4,Yum,"I really like the NO GLUTEN cookies. But these are for people who are really healthy and don't eat refined sugar or artificial sweeteners all day. After a while, things don't need to be that sweet to taste awesome to people like us.<br /><br />I can't eat gluten and I need to restrict my dairy and eggs (I should eliminate, but I'm still working on it). I don't eat sugar either (the cookies are sweetened with fruit juice). I really enjoy them and if you've got a lot of food intolerance issues, these are so convenient and good!"

I prefer it unsweetened, and even without sugar it has turned me from my Shasta Diet Black Cherry soda addition.<br />We recently got one of those instant hot water dispensers installed in our kitchen, which has reawakened my love of tea.  This is definitely one to be tried and will be a good addition to anyone's tea choices.<br />This is still one of my favorite teas.  One of my favorite desserts is a pot of this tea to sip while nibbling on a couple pieces of dark dark chocolate.  Tastes like eating a chocolate covered cherry...yummmmm"

The cookies are moist and almost cake-like and sweetened with fruit juice, though the rich and vibrant flaver does not give this away.  The ginger and lemon cookies will fool even the most sophisticated cookie palate.  Give them a try and treat yourself to a healthy dessert you can enjoy without feeding your body excess sugar, carbs, and processed chemicals.  It is all natural ingredients, with a wonderfully sinful flavor.<br /><br />Kristin, mother of 3, Arizona"

If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware."

The blueberry/kash clusters are also nice, adding texture and flavor, although I find that they float to the bottom of my bowl midway through.  I usually eat this with just milk for breakfast or to fuel a midday jog, but I've also been known to eat it right out of the box when I'm hungry and need something healthy to eat ASAP!<br /><br />The taste is slightly sweet without going overboard and could use a few more blueberries per serving, but I add my own.  This cereal is not, unfortunately, organic, as other items in the Kashi line are.  But it's still a great selection for a quick meal any time of the day!<br /><br />As for best prices on this product, I do NOT support Wal-Mart regardless of how low their prices are.  Whole Foods tends to be the most expensive, of course, and I've seen this elsewhere for about $3.49 per box.  Because it's Kashi, it won't be cheap but it's a good addition to your diet if you can afford it."

While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average."

I find that the cube, even on its ""hardest"" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it.  With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.<br /><br />At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full.  This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side.  This will encourage the dog to play with it.  Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle.  It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it.  She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out.  When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has.  Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day."

And it is good for that. But bear in mind that because it is not as acidic you might use more if you're looking for sourness, but the sherry taste is good.<br /><br />But I've found another use for it, a French technique. Finish reduction sauces with a shot of it, and it adds a great depth of flavor. If you want to blow the calories you've saved on the oil, mount the sauce at the end with butter too. Add a shot of this vinegar to stews too; a normal vinegar might be too overpowering but the sherry vinegar merely adds flavor.<br /><br />I buy it by the case."

It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Decaf Kombucha uses the same delicious recipe as our Green Tea Kombucha but is naturally decaffeinated. Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits.""<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of ""Kombucha-Pure"", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

I guess it's all about personal preference.  I'll look elsewhere for my candy."
07	70521,B000FNB3AI,A2EZN7CL5WURTX,9/5/07,0,0,5,Best cookie I've ever tasted,"As a newly converted vegan, there's not a lotta sweet food items I can eat that doesn't have milk or some type of milk product or animal product in it (not to mention refined sugars and bleached flours etc). I've tried Alternative Baking Company's double chocolate cookie, which I loved, but per cookie they charge $2 a piece. I searched for another company that makes a similar cookie, and found this company (Nana's). The cookie is every bit as good as  the ABC's cookie, and a lot cheaper at that. Hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten. For any vegans or anyone looking to decrease their sugar intake, this is definitely worth trying."
07	70520,B000FNB3AI,AL5VAC89VKZ97,9/11/07,0,0,5,The best cookie and a great breakfast treat.,"This big, delicious, moist and chewy cookie fits the bill for a great on-the-go breakfast or travel meal. Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.<br />Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other ""healthy"" cookie or pastry-bar type treats: (organic) WHOLE wheat flour. Not ""wheat flour"", which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies."

07	70519,B000FNB3AI,AL5VAC89VKZ97,9/22/07,0,0,4,It tastes like a brownie,I was surprised at the intensity of the chocolate flavor in this cookie.<br />It is slightly drier than some of the other Nana's cookies I've tried. Probably because it's loaded with cocoa powder!

Like Nana's other cookies, these are not very sweet. The part I like best are the walnuts that are mixed providing a sublte crunch in these otherwise soft cookie."

She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage.  One thing - protect your toes with this toy - it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit.  I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick-knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it.  Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't broken yet.<br />As far as treats to go into it - remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty..."

And since I'm too lazy to make chocolate filling/frosting from scratch, this Schmear stuff is great.  In case you're wondering what it's like, it's kind of a bittersweet chocolate taste, at least when used as a frosting (you can bake this stuff in a pastry, but I haven't done that).  Some family members & friends love it because they don't like super-sweet frostings, while others have a sweet tooth, and have a hearty scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of the cake to help balance out the bittersweet.  One can filling per 9x13 sheet or 9-inch 2-layer cake is plenty, and adding chocolate shavings on top of the cake ""pretties"" it up a bit.<br /><br />The Amazon six pack is nice, because I'll keep a couple cans in my cupboard, and I'll pass a couple cans to my mom, because Dad LOVES this as a frosting.  He swears it contains chocolate liqueur, even though I've read the ingredients label to him.  :)  Another nice thing, the Schmear Chocolate has natural ingredients, and no trans fats (supermarket canned frostings contain trans fats, but this Schmear doesn't)."

He absolutely will not eat if something doesn't meet his expectations.  Between that and the recent pet food recalls, I've had a really hard time finding cat food that I can feed him.  I'm happy to say that the Merrick Southern Delight clicks with him, plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers.  The texture of it is appealing, too . . . it's not just ""mush"" or Spam-looking like many foods.  I'll continue to buy Southern Delight and plan to also try out some of the other Merrick flavors."

I sure wish I hadn't!!!  Now I am stuck with a whole box, and I couldn't even gag one of them down.  They have the worst aftertaste.  It doesn't even taste like edible food.  They are greasy and taste like vomit.  Sorry to sound so dramatic, but I want to prevent you from making the same mistake I did and save you your money.

When my wife tried it she couldn't get over how great it tasted. Being a tea drinker all of her adult life and fancying herself as knowing a good tea from a bad she just had to have a supply of this tea. We couldn't find a local store that carried it so we went to Amazon to order some. The company that we ended up with wasted no time in getting the tea to us without difficulty. Of course once you add in the shipping the price of the tea goes up, but that's a small price to pay in order to make my wife a happy woman."

Bright red, tastes like vanilla with a very light cherry taste. I see others describe it as bubblegum taste but I don't think it tastes like bubblegum. Its more like vanilla cream with just a hint of fruit. This drink is a must taste! Too bad we can't get it here in California grocery stores! Awesome!"

We've tried the shells and elbows.  We prefer the elbows as a pasta dish as the shells are very small.  But the taste is equally good and we've had no trouble switching from the white or wheat flour variety pastas.

Every review raved about the excellent service provided by JR Mushrooms.  I phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice-mail.  I left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions.  I ordered these truffles and several other items.  The next morning there was a little personal e-mail from JR thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived, although I chose the cheapest shipping.

I've been a tea drinker all my life, so I'm rather opinionated as to what I like and what I don't.  This is by far the best tea I've ever had!!  I can't find it locally, but have been lucky enough to find it on-line.  It has a very unique flavor that you just can't find in your typical Lipton or Red Rose tea."
07	84496,B0002DJNIU,AYQ8RLE0K6RU8,8/23/07,0,0,4,3 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."

It smells and tastes organic and pure.<br /><br />The only problem I have is with the packaging. When I received the product the box was banged up and appeared to be old. But what bothered me was that the tea bags themselves looked old and flimsy. The tea bags are individually wrapped but when you unwrap them they almost fall apart. The bag material is really thin and frail and it barely holds its content inside. The bag only broke in two or three instances out of fifty but I had to be careful with them. Other than that, I loved drinking this tea."

07	21844,B000KV61FC,A1DS2TCL7R1Z4E,5/4/07,12,12,4,Not bad but not Jasper proof,"This toy is great for preventing my dog from inhaling all his food.  Unfortunately it takes him less than an hour to empty it, so it's doesn't keep him as occupied as long as I'd like.  So far minimal/suspected wear (bottle is scratched up and some of the nibs of the rubber chew part are gone) and I'm waiting to see if he manages to untie the knot of the rope (like he has on another toy).<br /><br />Update 6/30/07: The screw on part has suffered some damage. It's almost as if Jasper bit it while it the toy was intact, nearly breaking a chunk out of it.  Looks like I'm gonna have to buy another or find another toy. (So if I could I'd drop my rating to 3 stars.)<br /><br />Update 12/30/07: Now the rope is ""unraveling"" near the top knot and it's getting stuck in the opening, making it hard for even me to get the rope out enough to dislodge the food.  So it's definitely time for a new toy to dispense Jasper's food, which could very likely be this one simply for the ease of loading the food."

The product claims to give energy and reduce appetite yet after drinking the tea I never experienced a decrease in appetite or any energy. Wouldn't buy it again.

It took her about a day to figure out the fastest way to get to the treats, but even so it still takes her some time to work everything out of it.  It's better than other treat-dispensing toys I have which make the treats either too easy or too difficult to get out.  The only reason I wouldn't give this toy 5 stars is that my dog was able to chew right through the attached rope within the first hour of playing with it, so that part of it was not too durable.  Still, even without the rope it's a good product."
07	86768,B000HA3IAW,AWJUS0F6TS5T7,2/14/07,0,1,3,so-so,Tastes ok.  A couple of cups gives a slight buzz.  Doesn't really kill my appetite like I was anticipating.
07	498,B000G6RYNE,AJQD2WWJYOYFQ,8/8/07,0,0,4,"Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!","Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."

07	86801,B000FAPM3K,A7T8D43YMLMMR,3/7/07,2,2,3,Good taste but little amount of curry,Tastes just like restaurant red curry but me and my wife needed 3 packets to make enough curry for us.  Boxes are alot smaller than we thought.  I give 4 stars for taste and 3 stars for the amount.

07	86804,B000FAPM3K,A3VNX289N1PYG4,3/9/07,2,4,2,Not so good...,These are just like any other noodles... the only difference is that it takes twice as much to cook.  The sauce that comes with it is EXTREMELY HORRIBLE.  It tastes so bad that I had to use my own spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />1.  Would I eat the rest I have left?  Only if I'm really hungry.<br /><br />2.  Would I buy it again? No<br /><br />3.  Would I recommend it? No

Tea is inside 20 individual bags. So easy to use. Just put one or two bags in your cup, add boiling water, let steep for 5 minutes and then enjoy.  My shipment arrived in fine shape, no broken packages or mangled product. I am delighted to share my feelings about this product and the superior manner in which Amazon handled my order."

With treats inside, it honestly kept him busy for about an hour as he tried to figure out how to get them. Unfortunately, the rope, which was his favorite part of the Tug-a-Jug, was pretty much shredded after only a few days of play, and without it he's mostly lost interest in the toy. But, if your dog isn't an intense chewer, this toy should be able to last quite a while, and keep them intrigued."

07	65700,B000F959NO,A3NAVE6XO1FAHU,9/14/07,43,44,5,Search for this for quite a while,"Several years ago a friend and I had lunch in a Thai restaurant. It was my first introduction to the cuisine, which I loved. One of the things I greatly indulged in however, was the iced tea. (partly because it was tasty and unusual, partly because I'd gotten my Pad Thai extra spicy!)<br /><br />I'm a bit of a tea snob, I don't do lipton, I like to fresh brew loose leaf estate teas, etc....and have hunted for that particular ""blend"" if tea from the thai restaurant for years. When I got this package I was skeptical, it looked suspiciously like nasty instant tea. I brewed it up however and to my delight, found it WAS the excellent ceylon black tea blended with a delightful mix of spices that give it a sweet tang that is wonderful to drink hot or cold. (tip, stew an apple in it with a little honey, oh my.)<br /><br />You will find some ""sludge"" at the bottom of the pan after brewing, as delightful as the brewed liquid is, avoid the tea fannings sludge, it's a bit gritty. Otherwise, this is that wonderful tea they serve in the restaurants. They often serve it as a dessert with cream or sweetened evaporated milk added, though I personally enjoy it just iced."

07	65701,B000F959NO,A1RFU0OYZ7N927,4/21/07,29,29,5,Wonderful!,"This tea is just like you will find at the Thai restaurant. I find it best to brew in the coffee maker, making it very strong and adding water to it later. I use about one cup of loose tea to 8 cups of water in the coffe machine. When it's all brewed and hot, I add the sugar, more water and keep it in the fridge. I add evaporated milk as needed, per each glass. It's a wonderful drink for a summer day!"

The list of ingredients listed in Amazon's blurb seems improbable.  It has a strong, complex cinnamon flavor. I recommend this tea for those who like cinnamon teas and are disappointed by how thin some of them taste."

07	36237,B000FGXT2A,AYH35N4QMAEY3,1/8/07,0,0,5,I love Kashi cereal,I was so happy to purchase this cereal in bulk because I live in NYC and a box of good organic cereal can go for $5+ very easily.
07	86815,B0000ZSHBO,A6RDVUJE0QKXN,11/9/07,9,9,5,Drink To Your Health,"I was interest in this particular brand of juice because it is not from concentrate and I know won't being getting filtered tap water with frozen bits of fruit. Also because it's organic, I know I won't be drinking unneeded chemicals to prolong shelf life. I'm fairly certain all drinks (at least juices) need to be pasteurized if bottled. This is the next best thing to pressing the pomegranate juice in your own home. The taste was delicious and I still drank in the antioxidants and nutrients found in pomegranate. Because I do not have the time or instruments to press the pomegranate myself, this is convenient for me to just pour and go. Although it is a little pricey, I figure my well being is worth it."
07	37899,B000F6SNPS,A3QE2WFFDWYN8N,1/4/07,3,6,5,Best tea with out adding anything!,"I have drank this tea for years. It smells great, it tastes great and the caffeine free tea is wonderful in the evenings when it is cold outside. Each tea bag comes with its own little sayings on it so each time you have tea you get something to read. Just to let first time buyers know do not let your bag sit in your water for very long as it tends to get a bitter taste. Just dip tea bag till color changes about 20-30 seconds and remove."
07	82565,B000OMMYNK,A28973L3OU3OVV,8/22/07,4,4,4,"Pricey, but tastes good","Is this really ceremony grade and organic? I don't think I should be the critic b/c I probably couldn't tell. I order items online all the time, but I wonder if this is the real deal. I drink it mostly for the health benefits and can't really tell if it's worth the money. The company website looks amateur and makes me question this product. However, it does taste good. Better when first brewed hot (not boiling) and then refrigerated or added to other cold foods/drinks."
07	44235,B000FL1I3C,A3HZJNP1OQ1JRY,1/8/07,1,1,4,Best that I have found,"I had my first experience with Big Train Chai, 8 years ago, it was in a christmas basket from an employer. It was so friggin good, that, ever since, I always treat myself to a box of 25 every year. Yup it is that good.. Think I will go make a cup right now !"
07	36238,B000FGXT2A,A21NT0LVL7QE9F,1/2/07,0,0,5,Great price for this grownup cereal,We go through cereal pretty quickly so ordering several boxes at a time works well for us. The price from Amazon is lower than that in stores. No reason to buy from brick-and-mortar any more!
07	86820,B0000ZSHBO,A2JZE71Y4IHXS6,3/7/07,6,13,1,Pasteurized?,This product description does not say whether this product is pasteurized. Alton Brown on Good Eats says that if pomegranate juice is pasteurized you lose a lot of the antioxidant benefits. I would likely change to more stars if it is not pasteurized.

However, I'm really satisfied with this Rishi earl grey. It tastes as good as Fauchon and Hediard and the price is only half. It is highly recommended."
07	86834,B0006SKCVI,A1XBNJBFO3XYR5,10/16/07,1,1,5,Love this stuff!,This sauce is delicious. Adds quite a kick to salsas or chilli. It's also good with eggs. Good for people who like spicy food. It has a wonderful flavor.

I also made this in the coffee pot, 1 teaspoon per 1 c. of water.  Excellent.  I then used condense milk to sweeten it.  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWesome!<br />Excellent service from Import Foods.  I placed the order on Monday and received it, priority mail on Friday.  Very pleased with the product and the company."
07	29985,B000GB25LA,A1CB7TWXNEWBPJ,12/22/07,0,0,2,Disappointing,The rooibos is fine but the Early Grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed. Tastes more like a perfumed tea than a balanced blend emulating the classic black tea version. I've had very fine rooibos versions of Early Grey so I know it can be done.

07	46060,B001EO5QZK,A2R4BNNO98V4A2,12/18/07,3,3,2,This is not premium quality tea,"I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green."

The contents didn't really seem all that fresh, though Exp. date is well into the future. Not something I'd buy again. I will use in baking only."
07	6250,B000E65OF6,A1FBHYKZS4B08A,4/2/07,1,1,5,Tradition,at it's best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber !
07	46126,B001EO5QZK,A1M5D0DG09UGVM,7/26/07,0,0,4,Big leaves,I haven't had any problems with this tea so I am a notch above indifferent.  I don't regret buying it.

Try the cinnamon bread recipe on the bag. Double the sugar and the cinnamon and again....an excellent GF bread treat once again made easily in the bread machine.."
07	17272,B000GPXRRW,A3AAWP3AWC4UR1,1/3/07,1,1,4,Tastes great,Not much to say- good stuff.  Amazon's grocery concept is great and I look forward to ordering more.  Now if only they offered Coffee-mate's Vanilla Chai Spice creamer.  That is some amazingly delicious powder right there.  Try it if you haven't yet!
07	82533,B000FL52IY,AH6P5QSUQ89JC,9/1/07,2,3,5,"Makes an excellent, smooth, flavorful espresso shot","The true test of a coffee's flavor for me is to drink it as espresso.  I've been roasting my own coffee for years, but mix it up sometimes by buying already roasted coffee.  This coffee has a great flavor with no bitter after taste when I drink a shot from my espresso machine.  When I drink it as regular coffee, I'll blend several of my favorite beans to get more complex flavors.  If you really want to find your favorite coffee, do a blind taste test.  It's fun and you might be surprised at which coffee you choose when your preconceived notions are taken out of the equation."

07	82524,B000FL52IY,A2L2ZOP63SD2WY,10/1/07,4,4,3,Solid Coffee Pick,"Jeremiah's Kona Blend is a good tasting, middle of the road coffee bean.  While not as flavorful as J's Fogbuster, the Kona is light and mellow, offering a nice change of pace for dark roast drinkers.  I brew in a french press most mornings, but when I ran it through a drip machine for company the flavor became too slight.  Be prepared to grind a lot of beans if you brew drip.  Overall a good pick and a good value."
07	82522,B000FL52IY,A6YPQ79VENZLJ,3/7/07,7,7,5,Great Mild-medium flavored coffee,"My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee, I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee.  This one however is just right for both of us.  I drink it daily without cream or sugar (which I only do when I actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee).  And we are on our second 5 pound bag!  I wish we had found this coffee sooner, it is great."
07	82521,B000FL52IY,A6GUCO1EZ3T0P,1/15/07,11,11,3,"Good Coffee, Not a Great Coffee","First, I have to confess that I expected this Kona blend to knock my socks off.  It didn't do that, or even come close to it, but it is a perfectly adequate coffee even if it is not what I would call a great coffee.  It is very mild, not bitter, and can be made in various strengths according to individual preference with no bitter after-taste.  I don't feel that I wasted my money but I am not sure I shall buy Jeremiah's Kona Blend again."
07	35729,B00020UGN4,A14NYKVV4CYF5S,5/11/07,2,3,5,There is none better.,I have never ever tasted a finer and more delicious chocolate in my entire life. The only thing I would ask Leonidas Belgian Chocolates to do is make up some chocolates with whole almonds in them. That would be the best of both worlds.

07	19109,B000LQNK96,A2SPVQNKOW9YNN,10/24/07,2,9,2,fair to good,I found the taste a bit on the strong side and while it was definitely seafood flavored I could not distinguish what seafood. It is still passable though and the portions are large enough for 2.
07	18606,B000F4H5F4,A2XFTN0MZUKAJB,4/30/07,6,7,5,MY FAVORITE TEA,"This is delicious tea, with or without milk and/or sugar. I drink it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and iced on hot summer afternoons. I drink the decaf version with midnight snacks. IMO, this tea tastes every bit as good as the English Breakfast tea from Peet's or Starbuck's. I use a ""strainer"" (infuser)  with very small holes, like the Teeli Brew Basket or Swissgold Tea Filter. Amazon sells both. Get it wet before you put in the tea. Enjoy your cuppa!"

I rather liked the taste of these bars, and I applaud the company for making nutritious food so convenient.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed that the cocoa is processed with alkali. This processing destroys most of the flavonols, which is what all the health studies that are based on raw cocoa rave about. If they used real quality beans that didn't need this processing, I would give this product 5 stars."

When this order arrived, I ate one bag each day until I came down to 5 bags. I realized what I have done.<br /><br />However, it was yummy and no trans fat.  More healthy than most brands.<br /><br />Now I know, I can only order a bag, not 24 bags next time. :)"

It has a delicate flavor, but when I drink it I can tell I am getting lots of antioxidants.  I also like the Celestial Seasonings green teas, but I get bored with those flavors after drinking them for a long time.  Other than this tea, there is only one other tea I have not grown tired of, and it is a loose-leaf tea from Japan that is found in asian grocery stores.  It comes in a purplish metal tin can.  A normal price to pay for this tea is $2-2.50 for a box of 20 bags, so this is a great deal."
07	18375,B000CMF1A0,A2SU6GK7WIP5CN,3/21/07,3,3,4,Tasty New Favorite,"Yogi Tea has introduced a winner in Egyptian Licorice Mint.  It's the perfect after dinner herbal tea.  It doesn't have a strong licorice or mint flavor, but instead a delightful synthesis.  I feel like it's easy on my tummy and doesn't need food to complement it.  What more could you ask for?"
07	64653,B000I66258,A1P7SGUJ0CIXPR,11/23/07,3,3,5,Almost like fresh,Oregon brand fruit is by far the best canned fruit you can possibly buy. All I've tried are virtually like eating fresh. My favorite is the Royal Anne cherries but the Blackberries are a close second.
07	18607,B000F4H5F4,ACAWGJ9OSCN70,1/8/07,3,3,5,English loose tea,"Loose tea is so much better than tea bags.  I have two cups every morning, and sometimes want more.  Even the second cup doesn't get bitter or harsh.  Of course you have to drink it with no sugar or cream."
07	58410,B001EO5QBE,AQI23XVTO6APV,12/28/07,2,2,2,Down home ??  Chicken Soup,I had high hopes that this soup would taste homemade but it tastes much like other boxed soups - very salty and not as if it was cooked from scratch.  The noodles were good but the rest of the soup was not at all what I had hoped it would be.  I would not buy again and now I have UNUSED packages left : (
07	83954,B000FNJ5JO,A2KO4TO49BF689,2/28/07,2,6,4,Green Tea Powder,I received my package of Green Tea with three days and it was exactly as decribed in the ad.
07	68673,B000E63LOW,A1EJ95I5W5S8FK,3/11/07,0,0,5,Lovely delicate green tea - which just happens to be decaf,"I adore this Celestial Seasonings Decaffeinated Green Tea! Before this, I had been drinking Stash Premium Green (with caffeine).  I had heard bad things about the taste of decaf teas in general so I was hesitant to try this decaf version from C.S. But, WOW, am I glad I did. This tea has so much more flavor, is so much more delicate and lovely than Stash could ever hope to be. And this is decaf! Remember when you brew green tea - it is best to use water that isn't quite hot enough to boil - that keeps your cup of green tea from getting bitter. (Conversely, black and herbal teas are best made boiling water) Also, do not brew it too long - meaning, don't go longer than the recommended time noted in the box flap - or you'll release more tannins and experience slight bitterness. Personally, I brew mine on the weak side (3 minutes) with not quite boiling water, I add 1/2 tsp of sugar, and milk .... pure heaven in a cup. Lovely fragrance, taste, and aftertaste. Others might say milk overpowers green tea, but I enjoy it. I believe this tea only contains 5 mg of caffeine per cup (decaf is never 100% free of caffeine) so you may drink it at night without worry about staying up all night, or if you doc recommends cutting down on caffeine, or if you simply want to give your tummy a break from irritating caffeine - this is the ticket. Enjoy!"

Some of you may be skeptical but this special variety is short and plump but has a nice shine and not brittle when it is steamed. Also the texture is smooth as you eat it along with your favorite foods. Excellent for sushi. People who like their cooked rice a bit glutinuous will love this.

It's an all natural caffeine-free tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

I'm hoping to experiment and find some new ways to cook the basic product so I can have more variety than I get from small variations in the cheese and vegetables that I mix in.

I will frequently have several cups of this tea in the winter and in the summer it makes a good iced tea. I have several friends who have diabetes and they have all really liked it when I serve it. Unlike a lot of other herbal teas, this tea is based on spices rather than on rose hips which tend to upset my stomach. I highly reccommend this tea to anyone that likes herbal teas and likes to watch their sugar intake. The caffinated Good Earth original tea is also very good, giving you a caffine hit and a slightly sweetened tea without using sugar. Both teas have a very pleasant taste without being overwhelming.

It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called ""Pouchkine"" or ""Afternoon Earl Grey"" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers)."

I am currently a matcha neophyte but I noticed that the expensive matcha tasted significantly better, seemed more fresh, and had a better brighter color.  I use one heaping teaspoon per pint of hot water, and unfortunately with the more expensive variety it costs over five dollars per pint of matcha tea when you use this much.  Even so, if you can afford it, seek out the finer grades of matcha straight from Uji Japan.  The Uji region is famous for their fine Gyokuro tea and superior grades of matcha.  If you don't have that kind of money, this matcha could suffice, but try to get the Uji-based premium matchas, especially for special occasions.  This matcha is listed as being from Uji, but it isn't as good as the more expensive varieties from the same area."

However, they are easy to chew (probably because of the nice, soft plastics they contain). I am striving to slowly back away from the QO granola bars because of their unhealthy and lengthy ingredient list.<br /><br />The Kashi brand snacks are agreeable to the palate and they do have enough sugar for my personal tastes, but I have a couple crowns and I wonder if my over-priced prosthetic teeth can survive this healthy eating experience.<br /><br />That being said, these are the snacks of choice for long car trips. For one, I'll never pig out on them and two, they're good for the tummy. They provide a little energy boost and they're high octane fuel for this four-layer bio-suit we call a human body.<br /><br />I'm working my way through the different flavors.

07	83942,B000FNJ5JO,A3O7E2VHPG9KAN,1/4/07,22,22,5,The REAL skinny on Caffeine in Green Tea,"Two other reviewers have already spoken. The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source:<br /><br />Caffeine<br /><br />Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.<br /><br />Enough said.........enjoy your tea............."
07	83941,B000FNJ5JO,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,1/8/07,41,43,4,Best Matcha in this price range!,"This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea.<br /><br />Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality.<br /><br />Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!<br /><br />Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!"

This tea is the ONE exception.  I first drank this years ago in a Good Earth restaurant (the first really healthy restaurant) & I was hooked immediately!  I have never since found a tea that was even close to this.  Most teas have a leafy, stick taste that screams to be covered up with sugar.  This tea stands alone, no sugar, no cream - nothing but incredible full flavor.  It is not much like typical tea but rather almost a cider instead (minus the apple juice).  It has the most wonderful cinnamony flavor that is warming & relaxing.

The box comes with three packets - the cake mix, coconut, & ""frosting mix"" (which is just powdered sugar).  The cupcakes were okay - they were pretty moist, but I used all the coconut in the cake rather then reserving 1/3 for the topping (I used additional store-bought coconut for the topping).  The ""frosting"" was awful - it's the packet of sugar mixed with butter and cream cheese and it was very bad when made as directed.  I added in about another cup of powered sugar to make the constancy spreadable and taste right.<br /><br />Over all, the cupcakes were a hit, but for a $10+ mix that makes 12 cupcakes I shouldn't have to buy and add my own ingredients!  I could have easily done this from scratch for the same or less money and it would have been just as simple!"

Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!<br /><br />Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful vanilla caramel taste.<br /><br />I would use vanilla caramel Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.<br /><br />The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.<br /><br />Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate.<br /><br />Overall, vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate provides an excellent, sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"

He even bit through his 3 Kong's.  This is the only toy that has lasted.  He ripped the rope off after a few days, but this toy is still perfect.  He gets bored eating out of his bowl so now he plays with this and it's the only way he eats his food.  We put his alloted kibble and some smelly treats and he can play with it all day.  I was worried at first, because he was chewing the plastic bottle.  Then I saw that it was made of bullet proof plastic and he's only scratched it.  I wish they would make more indistructable toys because this is really his only one."

I usually make the sweet bread and it's very good, although it would make a great savory bread with herbs as well.  I didn't even think to try to make pizza crust with it, as we were using a mix specifically for pizza crust from another popular gluten-free brand, which I didn't really like (too light and thick like a deep dish, but without flavor).  I just tried Pamela's bread mix for pizza crust and it was amazing.  Not too thick and a bit chewy just like ""real"" pizza crust.  I did add the italian spices which are optional but suggested in the directions, and it was wonderful.  The first decent pizza we've had since we've been gluten-free!"
07	30094,B000DZFMEQ,APCDN1JK6B81P,11/7/07,81,88,3,"Good texture, flat flavor","I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon. So, while people like this mix- 99+ people have not (yet) rated this item."

My dog is a very rough chewer- he can even rip apart kongs, and he loves these treat balls. They don't last him for ""hours"" per say as the package states, but enough time that I am able to have him busy when we have company over. It's especially helpful if you insert a treat ball in both ends of the blue ball, making it especially challenging to pop out the edible discs. Not for an everyday treat obviously, due to quantity and prices, but I will definately buy them again!"

(When they dry out, some crackle and fall apart, which means you end up cooking not only the intact ones, but also the powdery stuff that ends up forming a goo in your hot water; also, some break in the process of cooking with the normal kind.) Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, I would suggest buying the minute kind."

I'm so glad I took the chance on this tea -- it's delicious, and extremely pretty in the tin, with the bits of orange and blue cornflower petals in the tea leaves.  Wonderfully fragrant, thanks to the orange.  Generally, I like gutsy, black, full-bodied tea, medium strong to strong, but I'm delighted with this refreshing change-of-pace.  It's not wimpy.

Much more interesting than just brown or white rice, the combination produces a great flavor and great texture. We will be buying more after we use up our current order. Update May 2007: Have ordered more. This rice is excellent in a variety of dishes and is priced nicely too, at least compared to the alternatives in our local grocery store. My favorite recipe: Cook with some added bouillion or real chicken stock, add 1 to 2 tsp butter, add some dry or chopped onion, sage, basil, oregano and whatever else you feel like and cook as normal (15 to 20 minutes)."

07	30095,B000DZFMEQ,AP61JGRTHSQBJ,4/15/07,22,22,5,Yay Bread!,"I discovered that I was gluten-intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good-tasting wheat-free products ever since.  My primary roadblock has been bread - every single loaf of gluten-free bread I've tried has been beyond disgusting.  I've been to health food store after health food store and haven't found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela's Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister-in-law's bread machine and fired up a loaf.<br /><br />Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular bread?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light-years beyond any other gluten-free breads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you've eaten other gluten-free (GF) breads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre-made GF bread, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It's a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn't have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana bread, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on-hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!<br /><br />I would say this is 90% - 95% as good as ""real"" bread.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat-free bread is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you're the only gluten-intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a bread machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the ""On"" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the bread machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly-baked GLUTEN-FREE bread.  EDIBLE bread.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten-Free setting on them.  There is hope for decent-tasting bread for us gluten-intolerant people!  THANK YOU Pamela's Products!!"

They come out too dry, don't have a good flavor, fall apart when used for sandwiches. But Pamela's Bread Mix tastes good, has a good texture, and doesn't have to be toasted to be enjoyed. It makes great sandwiches, and the several variations offered on the bag make for a nice variety of breads. My husband especially favors the cinnamon bread for breakfast. As a sandwich bread he really enjoys the plain bread recipe with about 1/3 cup of added sesame seeds in the batter and extra sprinkled on top. Since we found this mix we have stopped experimenting with the various GF recipes we have collected. It does it all and is easy to make."

The medicinal Yogi Tea line is fantastic.  It does exactly what the box says it will do... which is strange because I have tried many medicinal teas that have not given me any type of immediate or noticable results.  I can have a tummy ache, drink a 6-8 oz cup of Yogi Stomach ease and half way through the cup my stomach ache is gone.  The same goes for their bedtime tea:  once I drink a cup I can lay down, close my eyes and I'm out cold and in a deep/restful sleep.  This stuff is way better than the supermarket celestial seasonings line.  Twinnings or Traditional Medicinals don't compare either.  One important thing to be aware of regarding the Yogi line:  these teas are spicy and heavy.  Many of them have spices like cardimom, cinnamon, black licorice root, stevia leaf... some even have black pepper listed as an ingredient... they're loaded, but oh so good!!"

I ordered it, tried it to fry some fresh haddock, and was amazed at the difference between it and the ordinary frying mediums I had used in the past.<br />It also keeps so well right on the shelf.  Glad I tried it."

But since i've beem drinking this tea i have so much energy & i feel really good.  I catch colds a lot & they really knock me on my butt.  One day about 2 weeks after i first bought this tea i was getting sniffles & felt extra tired.  I thought ""here comes another cold"".  So i had 3 cups of this tea & i actually woke up feeling fine. I drank another cup that day just to be sure, and low & behold i didn't get sick.  Believe me i always get sick but NOT THIS TIME! Just some sniffles, nothing i couldn't easily handle. It's really amazing stuff.<br /><br />By the way the flavor is wonderful. It tastes light & minty sweet.  This tea is so good i actually crave it.  I wish amazon had a 12 pack deal  because i really need to stock up on this stuff!"

07	80137,B000EMD1QO,A3N86ADHPJY6Z6,4/19/07,1,2,5,"Great Green Tea, but how many bags are in this order...",I really like this green tea. I find it to be much better than the other brand. I add a little lemon and splenda to mine and enjoy it hot or cold.<br /><br />What I wonder is if it is 6/40 count boxes like the title reads or 6/20 count boxes which is in the description??? Hmmm.....If it is 40 counters then this is a great deal.
07	80136,B000EMD1QO,A2R6RA8FRBS608,10/1/07,0,0,5,all right by me !!!,"Lipton Decaffeinated Green Tea is the perfect thing to drink when you want a soothing hot or cold iced beverage. It works wonders to combat laryngitis as well. The tea bags contain decaffeinated tea which means you'll never lose a night's sleep from drinking this! SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online. Amazon states that this tea has antioxidants and in fact it does--but the antioxidants are in the form of flavonoids which are all natural antioxidants. Some evidence suggests that flavonoids reduce the risk for coronary heart disease at the same time that they lower your risk of several types of cancers. Tea flavonoids can also improve your body's immune system.<br /><br />I normally find this green tea most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I heat the water until it's almost at a boiling point; then I put the water and the tea bag into my cup. I let it steep for a few minutes before I add milk and one packet of ""sweet and low."" It's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality green tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking--hot summer's day. Pick some up and try it--you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SMILE"

07	37842,B000GRGSS0,A36B4WXFH2LISD,6/27/07,8,9,5,A healthy alternative to cooking oil and butter,"Ghee (clarified butter) has been used in India for ages, it can be used as a substitue for oil or butter, in most applications. It's a healthier option to butter and the other questionable frying mediums in use today.<br /><br />A more detailed description from http://www.pcta.org/general/ghee.asp :<br />""ghee is unsalted butter that has been baked to remove not only its butter fat solids, as in drawn butter, but also all water -- so as to produce a food that contains no molecular oxygen, and is thus extremely storable and not subject to rancidity as in normal cooking oils. The health advantages accrue from the fact that ghee contains no oxidized cholesterol, the kind which leads to free radical damage in the cells of the body. Ghee is pretty well known among nurtrition nuts, plus it's a staple within Asian Indian communities and can be purchased in specialty food stores. It looks just like butter in a jar""<br /><br />For those new to Ghee, do bear in mind it has a unique odor and flavor that may take some getting used to. The odor is not really strong and is somewhat buttery.<br /><br />If this is your first time trying it and you don't like it, you can always use it instead of butter for baking, provided the dish you are baking has a reasonably pleasant odor of it's own. Overall, the quality of the product itself is really good and it tastes great.<br /><br />I like the small 8oz jars instead of one large one, it's easier to handle them and you don't need to scoop some out into a smaller container for daily use. Once a can is over, just pop open a new one. Also, ghee has a long shelf life and you don't need to refrigerate the unopened jars. However, if you don't plan on using up an open bottle in about a month, it helps to store the container in the refrigerator, especially in summer!"

I am a daily tea drinker and this is my tea of choice.  I like it strong.  With the Rishi Earl Grey loose tea, I can brew it as strong as I like and it is never bitter or metallic.  No chemical flavors here either.  The tins are a useful bonus around the house, too.  Highly recommended."

He would bore easily of eating out of his dish, and we found that he was eating below his recommended daily intake.  He was just getting bored and distracted.  We ordered the tug-a-jug and began giving him all his meals in it--it's made all the difference!  He makes sure to get our attention while he's maneuvering it to get at the food, he seems very proud of his accomplishment whenever he gets the pieces to come out.  He gets very creative with different tactics.<br /><br />Five stars across the board, the tug-a-jug has become absolutely indespensable to us!"

07	13839,B002KE33QC,AYQ8RLE0K6RU8,8/23/07,0,0,4,3 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."

I am generally not very picky about what I eat as far as taste goes and the ingredients all sounded good to me but somehow these bars are just not good. I hated to write a bad review for anything but I really can't eat these. I don't think I know anyone that I would even try to give them to. I tried these and the spirulina ones and both were equally unappealing. Maybe the chocolate ones might be ok, I don't know."

A normal pretzel has no nutritive value. This has protein and fiber. Some people would argue 'I am just snacking on these, I get my nutrition from my meals.' This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.<br /><br />As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?"

07	22371,B001HTJ49G,A393F381MA82AY,4/2/07,6,7,5,Crunchy with fiber,Spelt pretzels with fiber are hard to come by.  Organic to boot!  My family used to eat Vita Spelt until I realized there was no fiber in them and they weren't organic.  Much cheaper on Amazon than in Whole Foods.
07	22373,B001HTJ49G,ASGDHRFHT5AJC,6/25/07,3,3,5,"Nice flavor, and better for you too!","I started with Newman's Own Pretzels with the Protein ones.  The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings.  The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!"

I was a little skeptical; they were so cheap! When I got home and popped one in my mouth, I was so surprised each puff was lightly covered in cheese. Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A healthy snack<br />Lightly covered in cheese<br />Delicious, too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is so hard to put down a bag!"

The orzo is pretty good, but the rice, oh, the rice, what a terrible disappointment. I was surprised to see that the directions call for such a short cooking time, and sure enough, it did cook that fast. That might sound like a good thing, but the rice came out quite mushy. Looking more closely at the uncooked product, it sure looks to me like it has been processed in some way prior to packaging (maybe it has been parboiled then dried?). In any case, I'm so disappointed by this rice I'm going to give it away to a food bank and just go back to buying rice at my local health food store.<br /><br />If I'm right about the processing of this rice, it should be noted in the product info, and it isn't. If I had bought this locally I would be returning the 3 unopened jars, but it just seems like too much hassle to worry about and I'm sure the food bank will be happy to have it.<br /><br />I have bought literally hundreds of items from Amazon, and this is the first one I've felt compelled to comment on. I absolutely love Amazon, but this product is a total bust."

The taste is mild, which is what I like in a pretzel (that's not chocolate covered), and they're just the right ratio of thickness and size, not like some that are so thick and dry that they stick in your throat, or so thin that you're chewing super-salty air. Plus they're actually a bit healthier than most others. Unfortunately they're also more expensive, but I'm happy to say I always get what I pay for with these."

I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****"

Had a Bigelo 20 bag box, individually foil packed, and bought this bulk pack to save money. This huge pack contains 4 bags per foil, for freshness. Price was far better than Bigelo site, or others online, so bought it. Found them in Sam's Club cheaper the next week.<br /><br />Each tea bag is designed as one upright sack--different from the folded/split bags in my previous Bigelo 20 bag box. These tend to float and require more effort to disperse compared to the previous bags with twice the surface area, in folded pouch design.  It is what it is. To me, green tea is about the most disgusting tasting thing I've ever had, and I hope it grows on me because this is an exercise in sheer discipline. I just hate green tea, but can't fault this product for that. Entire family hates the smell of it, and loathes any taste of it. I hope it is an acquired taste...this is straight green tea w/no sweetener or mitigating flavors."

My female also loves this but she's a little less silly.  Also, this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions.  I finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk (i.e., 5 lbs. bags) since I was going to the store ALL the time to buy more of these.  I also stuff their Kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it. I highly recommend this treat."

The gloves are huge - I normally buy a large in dishwashing gloves.  The fingers are so long that they were flopping around and the gloves are so big and cumbersome that it took me about 2 minutes each to get the first 2 done..  After that, I threw this useless ""gadget"" in the sink and got out a knife.  The instructions say to just rinse them off and let dry - yeah, good luck with that."

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead."

I especially like the fact that it contains more protein than the Luna/Cliff bars, uses protein Isolate instead of Concentrate, and has no added sugar (who needs more calories?!).  I prefer bars that have only Whey protein Isolate or Soy Isolate since I'm lactose intolerant (whey concentrate doesn't agree with most people who are lactose intolerant).  I really like the taste and texture of the bar and it doesn't have a foul smell like some others I have tried.  I would like to see them make a mostly organic version like Cliff/Luna has done and possibly lower the fat content a little.  This bar really helps stave off hunger for several hours thanks to the high protein content."

It is simple to make using a bread machine,(it can also be made in the oven).  Although the bread does not rise as much as I would like it to, the slices are more than large enough for an adult sized sandwich.  It holds together without toasting, no crumbling.  It stays fresh for several days, and freezes well. I found that using 1 less tablespoon of water than the recipe calls for improved the quality of the bread."

In the past I have found it difficult to omit wheat from my diet but this bread makes it easy and very enjoyable.<br />Thank you Pamela's Products"

Although, the frozen bread is good to eat right after toasting it, it just did not work well for sandwiches in the kids lunch box.  So, I searched the net for bread recipes and became really frustrated because my bread would cave in each time.  Then I found Pamela's Amazing Bread.  Let me tell you, it is truly amazing in my eyes.  Not only does it taste great, but it bakes beautifully in my bread maker.  It has a nice crust and is soft and great for sandwiches, grilled cheese, toast, etc.  We add 1/4 cup of flaxseed to the mix.  Kids love it, so mom is really happy!"

One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other ""Jamaica grown"" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price."

Why would I do this, you ask? I read that dairy products are the best form of calcium you can get, dairy and broccoli. Enriched products, like soy milk, are okay sources, but not as good as the real deal. So I mix the two together to make sure my kids get the best possible calcium intake they can. They wouldn't drink it just so though so improvised. This company is great! Cow's milk is just not good for people! Goat milk is infinitely better. I use to make their mac and cheese and things like that too.

It's about the same liquid to fish ratio as standard tuna, except instead of water you pour down the sink, you get very well seasoned sauces. The ""Spicy Chili"" flavor features a wonderful tasting sauce with chunks of chili, but be warned this stuff packs some heat. I have a fairly high tolerance for spicy foods and this was just right for me. 170-calories (give or take)per can. Throw in some mini carrote and a few crackers, and you have a very satisfying meal for very few calories. (.....)!"

It has little to no texture, it is very bland, and it gums up very quickly even with more than the reccommended amount of water. I originally bought Kashi because prepackaged oatmeal is overly sweet -- this is not sweet at all. I also found it to be too creamy. If you're looking for an excellent hot cereal, try the Kashi Cinnamon and Honey."

The reason I bought this from Amazon is they had a deal that allowed me to buy it for much less per bag than other places.  When I got it I noticed one of the 12 bags was opened already.  OK I was still in the black on the deal but after I put it on the shelf for a few days I pulled it down to get another bag and 3 more were open.  4 of the 12 bags were open and that isn't acceptable.
07	64500,B000JVEJ16,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,3/5/07,1,1,4,Good Tea with Hibiscus Flowers,"****<br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, juicy, red fruits"".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as other teas such as Numi, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br />****"

This is a light snack that is full of cheesy flavor, and it doesn't make a mess on our hands. If we're not careful, we can eat almost an entire bag at one sitting -- it's that good. I've ordered it several times since 'discovering' it.<br /><br />Now -- if only it was available on auto-delivery!"

I tried using it as a spread on a ham wrap and it was too much for one wrap. Too salty for me but then I use Mrs Dash a lot so I guess I'm kind of sensitive with salt. It's nice though that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so you can take it with you. I thought the taste was okay and the texture thin, not watery, but just thin.<br /><br />Take care all"

With all the high fat and high sugar cheeze puffs most people are used to these may taste somewhat bland at first bite, but believe me you'll be craving it soon enough. I offered my neighbor a handful and even though he thought they were just okay he came back ten minutes later and asked for an entire bag. My dorm room is full of sugary pop tarts and rice krispy treats, but I always go for these first and I think that kept me from gaining too much weight during finals."

It is almost spherical and fairly stubby. Although it says ""citrus"" it is sooo orangee that well, you don't taste much else. The other citrus flavors are only in the form of subtle hints. Drinking orangina is almost like having aromatherapy. It is an adult and child pleaser, too. This is the beverage that allowed our children to ""have a soda"" without having a soda. We are a no pop household. It is also wonderful poured into a more sophisticated goblet, the flavor is alluring and can almost be called pretentious when properly served in place of a dessert liquor or wine spritzer. A lot of us adult Earth pod dwellers don't drink alcohol but want the joy of sipping and savoring. Great beverage. A treat like Polinarious. Enjoy. oh, and the pulp, hardly!"

I have only had one but I noticed that as I got through them the taste seemed better.<br /><br />I did not find them excessively greasy but they are high in fat.<br /><br />I intended to use these as a meal replacement, as a natural alternative to the energy bars that are basically vitamin enriched candy bars that somehow don't taste as good and I am sure that that is what I will do.<br /><br />The one thing that keeps me from giving this item more stars is that it has an acidic aftertaste that reminds me of stomach acid and can make me a little queasy but not as bad as the regular energy bars."

It cooks easily and quickly.  I like to pack several packets for vacations, business trips or camping trips because the soup is so easy to prepare with just a little bit of hot water.  And if you forget a spoon, it's okay - just drink it like broth.<br /><br />Making miso soup ""from scratch"" is one of the things I've failed miserably at every time I've tried, but with these packets I can save myself time, heartache and money.  It even tastes better than some of the miso soups I've had in restaurants."

When we moved to MN 20 years ago I was able to find it in stores here but in the last couple of years it has been unavailable. I have requested the stores start carring it again, to no avail. I was so excited to learn I could order it through Amazon and did. One hint, I sift out all the dried onion flakes before I add the remaining spices to the tomato paste. I prefer to sprinkle fresh green onion over the homemade cheese covered Enchiladas or Chili Rellenos along with a couple of dollops of sour cream and 2 or 3 olives.<br /><br />Wonderful!"

It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I love Tazo Teas and have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have always been impressed.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients. Caffeine Free.<br /><br />You can drink this tea as you type into the night...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
07	8190,B000FFILBA,A20PXGVX8OVEOM,8/23/07,2,2,4,Tastes more like a green than an oolong,"Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it."

Heavy, greasy, I actually threw it away.  Second time around I used extra virgin olive oil, half a cup of rice milk and an extra tsp of egg replacer.  I could not believe it when I looked through the window, I had to move the oven shelf up because the bread had risen 2""!!  If I hadn't have baked the first batch myself I would not believe that it was the same product.<br /><br />I guess it is a good thing I bought a box of 6 because I would definitely not have bothered again.<br /><br />I don't think it is as good as 'proper' bread though, my toddler is allergic to wheat, dairy and eggs, as she is still breastfeeding I have had to give up the good stuff too, hopefully I will be able to manage a bit better with this mix."

As for the chocolate itself, well... it is better than most store brands, but not as good as Godiva.  I would rather pay a little more for better quality, or pay a lot less for a bar of Cadbury."

(There's a store in New Orleans that offers over 200 brands.) What's hard is to make a sauce that has some flavor and some sensation other than pure heat.<br />Sriracha is a medium hot sauce with a fine fruity aftertaste and the substantial undertone of red pepper itself.<br />You'll find yourself adding small quanities of it to unlikely things like consomme, pancake batter and chocolate pudding where its very diluted heat will still carry the other flavor notes through and add a touch of complexity to dishes that are otherwise dominated by a single flavor or squished by an overwhelming texture.<br />By the way, the trick to using hot sauce as an undertone is it add it to half of the product until you can taste it, then add the reserved half of the product back to the pot.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman author of New Short Course in Wine,Theand the very spicy bang BANG: A Novel"

Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the ""English Breakfast"" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label."

This is an excellent and versitile tea, makes for a good hot tea and also a refreshing iced tea. A bit stronger than regular ""brisk lipton"" tea typically found in the U.S. I used to have to wait until I traveled to the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas to find this tea, but now it's on Amazon (darn, my excuses to travel are dwindling!). This is an Orange Pekoe tea in 200g bags. You can find different varieties of tea marked with the ""Lipton Yellow Label"" brand, usually loose leaf teas. For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of ""Pure Ceylon,"" a box of ""Coarse Black Tea"" packed in Mumbai, and another ""new bright & rich"" Mumbai variety which is a blend of ""Assam teas."" These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour."

Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product."

I have really enjoyed all three of them.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to ""normal"" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g<br /><br />Some typical advice - watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7-oz bags, 12-pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7-oz bag."

It is sold in air tight cans that keep the coffee fresh. It has a very good flavor and is finely ground.  A very good product.

Hooked ever since, this is the only coffee I ever drink now.  Starbucks, Caribou are nothing compared to this.  One sip or sniff of the aroma, will get you hooked forever.  If you ever make it out to South Beach, ILLY has a store on Ocean Drive."

We make two packages at a time and freeze one loaf (cut in two) while enjoying the other loaf. This cuts down on clean up and time in the kitchen.<br /><br />One tip... I cut preparation time in half by doing the following: I mix the yeast into the flour first, then I heat the liquids to 110 degrees before adding them. Once the mixing is complete, I place the loaf pans in a warm toaster oven. Rising is complete in about 30 minutes. Bake time only takes about 30 minutes this way. Delicious bread!"
07	6468,B000FNEX50,A2PVLGFRWRLAWB,5/28/07,1,1,5,So good -and good for you too.,My kids love these and I feel good about giving them to them. They're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. We like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. Yum.
07	6469,B000FNEX50,ATEIE93I26LUM,5/26/07,2,3,5,Great for those on a limited diet,"My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat, egg and milk.  I was so upset when I found out but a little relieved as I started finding foods he can eat.  Yes, they are crumbly but they taste good, my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions.  Since the option is not giving a 3 year old cookies I don't mind some crumbs!"
07	23646,B001E5DYSU,A2SBQ8UU7UOK8,1/8/07,4,4,5,the very best coffee,I was recently at a very nice restaurant for dinner and this was the coffee they served. It was so rich and delicious. We raved about it so much that our server gave us some of the beans to take home. I've been addicted ever since.
07	8182,B000G7M4U6,ASXUO8NYCVZP3,1/17/07,4,4,5,Great Deal,Ordered these seeds for a recipe that I got from my grandmother. Seeds came very quickly and well packaged. Much cheaper than buying all those small bottles at the grocery store. Would definatly use this company again.
07	23645,B001E5DYSU,APCVKWLNJC8YN,11/24/07,8,9,5,illy coffee rocks!,Been buying store bought coffees and even starbucks.  I thought starbucks was it but boy I was wrong!  When Im using this coffee I don't have to put sugar in my coffee which I usually do.  Its so weird but there is no bitter taste.  The freshness of the coffee definitely lasts longer compared to starbucks!Try this and you will never settle for anything less.

The taste is great and our Nanny really loves this stuff too!  I hope they get more on Amazon as the price cannot be beat.

I guess that doesn't matter as I eat it bulk too.<br /><br />It is light, non greasy and the flavor is grand.  Not too much cheese, not too little.  It is just right.  I love it!"
07	33741,B000CONMBS,A2FDRR6QQDCWDZ,8/28/07,0,0,5,Great snack,A great snack!!  My toddler loves this stuff.  I believe a prior reviewer is confused about a recall.  That was for a completely different Robert's product and had nothing to do with this one.

It stays moist and soft even after refrigeration or sitting in a lunch box for a few hours. To save money I bake mostly from scratch, but I can't find a bread recipe that matches the all the wonderful qualities of this bread. No microwaving necessary with this bread. The only dowside I've found, is that its a little dense."
07	30189,B000DZFMEQ,APPOYZZYWTYIT,9/5/07,0,0,5,Great bread alternative,"My son is allergic to wheat and eggs and this mix makes by far the best bread one can hope without these two ingredients. I use this mix in our bread machine with an egg replacer and it makes a nice loaf with a good texture and great taste, especially if you toast it. Pamela's Products other wheat-free mixes are also great if you want to make cookies or brownies that taste as good as any ""normal"" ones."

07	33744,B000CONMBS,A3POMQQK20XS0E,4/10/07,0,0,5,Love this stuff...,"I originally bought this on a whim after reading several positive reviews about it (that, and it was on sale).  This stuff is wonderful.  My kids actually prefer Pirate's Booty to Cheetos (""can we please have the healthy Cheetos instead?"")--coming from my kids, that's saying something.<br /><br />It's a much better alternative to Cheetos (and cheaper as well).  I love this stuff!  And if you're trying to count calories, two big handfuls of this (which equals 1 serving) go a lot further than a serving of Doritos or an equivalent.  I've actually given bags of this to friends/ family, and they always want to know where I bought it from!  Great snack!"
07	49527,B001E5E268,A2R4BNNO98V4A2,12/18/07,3,3,2,This is not premium quality tea,"I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green."

It is so flavorful, rich and moist when made following the directions for my bread maker and it couldn't be easier to use.

I didn't have high hopes but thought why not try since I have a wheat allergy.. It was worth the purchase again and again.. Thank you Pamela."

Not only do they have an extremely yummy taste and texture, they are also lower in fat than the others.<br /><br />If you have kids, these would be better to give them (shoot, they'd be better to give you, too! &lt;VBG>) than the extremely high-fat cheese puffs you find in every store, and the price from Amazon isn't too bad, especially if you catch them when they're on sale for twelve dollars instead of 18.74. But, even 18.74 is a better price than you find in most grocery stores who carry them, so, go for it! But...don't blame me when you find yourself eating an entire bag in one sitting..."

I took another reviewer's advice and added a little Triple Sec to the Tequila and mix and it was fabulous.  Surely, anyone who is ordering this has tasted diet drinks before.

We have frozen half loaves, and that works although the bread is more dry than when it is fresh.  Highly recommend."

07	80090,B0000D9589,AJBVY9K7D1AZ4,4/19/07,7,7,4,"Suited to its purpose, if not quite its goal...","If you like the classic taste of a good margarita, it's likely you'll find Baja Bob's Margarita Mix to be an acquired taste at best and a cruel joke at worst.  Not that it tastes horrible, but like most contests between similar products that are sugar-based and sugar-free, the recipe for which you already have a preference is going to win despite the competition's particular and sometimes overwhelming merits.  Since I've decided to limit my sugar intake but not my affection for margaritas, this tequila mixer is best suited to take care of the problem, so I've decided to stick with it and learn to like it.  Over time I've at least grown accustomed to the taste (adding extra Triple Sec helps), even if I can't say it's the best improvement to margaritas since the salt rimmed glass.  Splenda certainly works better in some things than others.  In this case it's a qualified success with taste taking a subjective second place to functionality.  I don't love it or hate it, but I don't miss the sugar either.  To that end Baja Bob's Margarita Mix does what it's supposed to do very well."

I only use 1/2 of the bottle at a time and the no refrideration needed makes it handy to keep in the car and drink on the way home from work when you have a lot you need to accomplish at home.  Love it!

Someone suggested i try this 5 hour energy and WOW! It really did work without the ""drop"" afterwards. I have noticed that when I take more than 3 a week I start to build up a resistance and they don't work quite as well.... but hey! That's what happens when you drink caffein too, right?"

Stash's Organic Ceylon is no exception - it has a good, but subtle flavor.<br /><br />The quality is good: the leaves are small tips and there is very little tea ""dust"" or stems in the bag.<br /><br />I have blended this 1:1 with Stash's Organic Assam for an easy drinking English-style tea."

These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!  SMILES"

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"

If you've never had Turkish Delight, I would compare it to the inside of a jelly bean.  It is served in small cubes and covered in powdered sugar to keep them from sticking together.  The plain flavor is similar to a white jelly bean.  I rated it a four because it is slightly fresher and softer in Turkey, but I was impressed with the taste.  Enjoy!"

Perhaps a more refined palate of a coffee connoisseur would disagree, but I find this coffee to be disappointing.  To be sure, it is ""extra bold"", but I also think it tastes extremely earthy.<br /><br />I can't recommend it, but if you like bold, strong blends, it might be more to your liking."

Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!

It is very smooth and can be easily consumed with minimal creamer.  If you like a strong bold roast, this may not satisfy you.  I use the TImothy's Rainforest Expresso for my morning wakeup (which is the best bold coffee I have found), then I switch to Newman's Own Extra Bold Special Blend later in the day.

I run an affiliate site, and it's like rolling dice every day to watch the product link change from available to unavailable.<br /><br />So, if you can get your hands on these, and you have a K-Cup brewer at home or at work, I seriously recommend that you try these out. They're a dark roast, which is my only problem with them (darker roasts have less caffeine because it breaks down under the heat of roasting). The fact that they're organic AND fair trade is a huge bonus as well. I'm glad that I don't have to wonder what chemicals are put on the beans and that I know that the farmers were paid fairly for their goods. Sustainability means a lot to me, in the environmental AND human sense.<br /><br />The flavor is heavy and rich but smoother than you would expect. There's just a hint of acid bite in the after-taste that I associate with all of the K-Cup coffees. I drink it black, but it's certainly full-bodied enough to handle even heavy cream. If you take sugar, it will probably bring out the woody flavor that this coffee has. It might even hold up to honey or fructose for the diabetics in the crowd."

My dog is a very rough chewer- he can even rip apart kongs, and he loves these treat balls. They don't last him for ""hours"" per say as the package states, but enough time that I am able to have him busy when we have company over. It's especially helpful if you insert a treat ball in both ends of the blue ball, making it especially challenging to pop out the edible discs.

The cherry pie bars taste amazingly like the real filling, except without all the unnecessary sugar.  The bars are sweet enough on their own and the nuts add a delightful crunch.  The other flavors are delicious as well.  The price of the individual bars can fluctuate by more than sixty cents depending on the vendor and Amazon sells them for less as a large package than the individuals would cost at the cheapest store.  The organic ingredients and lack of additives ensure that the bars are gluten-free, but are still tasty."

Packed with nuts to satisfy hunger for several hours and just sweet enough to keep cravings at bay.  My six year old even likes these.

We ran out of it because I had a pending order elsewhere that fell through(they might have kept my money forever if I hadn't cancelled the backordered order), so, needless to say, I was happy to find a good price on Amazon that actually beat what I had thought was the best deal I could find. I received my product within a couple of days and am very satisfied."

I suppose by meat, be means ""red meat,"" because Newman's Own Organics has Chicken, Chicken Meal, and Chicken Fat, to go along with all those vegetables and grains that he disdains.  Our vet recommends this kind of dog food (although not specifically Newman's), because of its reduced fat.  Golden Retrievers, and many other breeders, can gain weight pretty easily if you don't watch it, and dog food that reduces fat and calories is preferred by many (""California Naturals"" is another good one).<br /><br />OK, so the dog doesn't approach this with nearly the enthusiasm as the beef jerky, steak strips, and who-knows-what-else the neighbor feeds her when we're away (and I do think some treats are nice sometimes), but our dog no longer has a weight problem.  It also helps if you believe in the benefits of organic (pesticide-free) food, both for health and nutritional reasons, and if you like to support the Newman's Own brand, which donates its profits--millions of dollars over the years form their growing line of foods.

I have liked all three, and have only changed from one to the other to satisfy my curiosity and add a bit of variety to my life. The San Francisco Decaffeinated Blend is fine coffee. It is probable that I will try other Coffee Masters offerings, but this is not to say that I am in any way dissatisfied with the San Francisco Blend. I find that I have a distinct preference for Coffee Masters Coffee over other brands, and the individual CM blend doesn't seem important."

I have tried most of the larabar flavors and the taste and texture are delicious with all the flavors I have tried.  This is my absoulte fav with only 5 all natural ingredients.  My second choice is the pecan pie larabar.  Almost as good as this one.  I eat one for breakfast and then follow with a light mid-morning snack.

I like a well made percolator coffee, but years ago I discovered Tasters Choice. It's my favorite instant, hands down. Just put a teaspoons-worth in a coffee cup of water and nuke it in the microwave for 1:45 (well, in MY micro, anyway). The coffee is strong for some tastes; do you like espresso? Well, not that strong but definitely potent. Amazon sells it at about the same price as the local stores and with free-shipping that's a real convenience. Love coffee? Looking for something new? Here you are."

The problem is not with the product, but with the shipping. The first time I ordered it for her, all six cans were so dented in the box that we were scared to open them. The one piece of packing material,a completely deflated ballon, did not keep the cans from rolling around in a box way to large for them. Amazon did resend us the product at Amazon's expense (best customer service ever!), but once again the bag was nearly flat and the can were very damaged...except one and that one was very tasty though it cost $26. My advice don't buy can goods through the mail."

While it's true there is a bit less protein in this variety, there is significantly more fiber (6g vs. 1g for soy protein based flavors).  Note: there's a definite spice here, it's not overwhelming, but it's definitely there... as the flavor implies."

But after a couple of days my Corgi's which are very smart dogs, figured out how to get it out. Even after the treat was gone they would lick the plastic like crazy. There are new everlast locking treats out that are suppose to stop your dog from popping out the treat. I would try the locking system first since the balls are not cheap to replace."
07	49031,B000X1F9XY,A36L4ZEDFXTK9T,2/13/07,4,5,5,Great Dog Treats,We have three dogs and these treats are terrific.  They're great for the times when you just need to keep the dogs occupied for a spell.  They keep the dogs busy for a long time and they love them.  The only thing I'll say is that if you have more than one dog be sure to have one for each dog otherwise the typical jealousy among dogs occurs.
07	49943,B00430B73W,A2VB99ZTCY7ATE,1/8/07,2,2,3,Better flavor than the cashew bars,"These bars have a pasty consistancy and are greasy with a slightly off-taste (in my opinion).  They are very sweet and are, indeed, filling so they are great in the car when trying to avoid fast-food but I only like them enough to use them as a last resort.  Great ingredients though and probably very good for the body."

I have tried at least 40 brands of Earl Grey including British Imports, boutique tea shops, special blends, and variations on the traditional bergamot/black tea blend.<br />The flavor is so well balanced with a real bergamot taste.  This is not the typical weak flavor in many off the shelf blends.  This is the real deal and can only be compared with the best that this traditional blend has to offer."

So, since then, being the miso snob that I am, it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety.  But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste.  While I would still choose the actual product whenever time permits, I would now not hesitate to substitute this great product when I am on the run."
07	69024,B0018KR8V0,A2JSQCBXKZNNJO,10/19/07,264,270,5,Healthy RAW Snack,"Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then ""fortified"" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own !"

07	23527,B000HDOOL6,A34B4RIUQF314D,4/2/07,9,9,5,Tastes great,"I looked into how to duplicate how they make Chai's at the coffee shops, and I had no clue how to do that.  I found Oregon Chai mix at a local grcoery (then later I found a cheaper bulk 3-box pack at a grocery warehouse store), and I tried it. It can't be compared to a professionally made Chai (at least the way I make it), but it totally satisfies my requirement to be able to make it at home anytime I want.<br /><br />Bear in mind, I use Rice Dream instead of real milk, but it still qualifies as something that I can call a decent Chai drink conveniently made at home.  Extremely easy to make: you use 50% of this mixture and 50% of whatever kind of milk you use. And heat it up."

Recently, many brands of health bars have come out with chunks of fruits and nuts glued together with a sticky sweetener, such as aguave syrup, honey or evaporated cane juice. KIND Bars are not exceptional among these bars, and all of these types of snacks are very good in my experience.<br /><br />What makes KIND Bars different is that a portion of the profits is directed to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is a charity that supports peace in the Middle East. By ""peace in the Middle East,"" they mean support for the ""Palestinian Resistance"" againgst the Israeli ""occupation."" This charity is considered centrist, and it rejects extremism, which it finds to be ineffective.<br /><br />Executive Manager of the PeaceWorks Foundation, Fathi Mohamed Hamdan Darwish, had this to say about the strategy of driving Israel into the Sea: ""That solution is unrealistic and ineffective and can't be realized. We as a Palestinian people have historically paid the price of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and injured people and haven't reached this solution."""

She has also recently been discovered to have sensitivities to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy etc..  This was our last hope for her to be able to have a sandwich.  We ordered the single package first and prepared it with the suggested egg replacement, in our bread machine on the gluten free setting, which did not mix well, and was not fully cooked in the middle when finished.  So we took a leap of faith and ordered the 6 pack of Pamela's bread to try again because the taste seemed very good from the small pieces we ripped off the ends.  When I made this the second time I used the regular oven, and used less liquid (as suggested on the package to avoid under cooking) ---and tada!!!  It's wonderful, and lighter and softer than any other gluten free mix we've tried (we've tried 4 others) and my daughter ate it!  She can now enjoy a cashew butter and preservative free jelly sandwich on real bread!  Whew! Thank you Pamela."

I order the 120 bag refill for $6.30 (so far) and have plenty!<br /><br />The only down side to the style I have is that it is attached with an electrical zip tie and the end scratches my hand occasionally.

They're picky.<br /><br />With Greenies, they all go bonkers. We just need to start opening the bag and all three come running. It's become a reliable way to track them all down.<br /><br />One of them has figured out how to open the cabinet we used to keep them in, so we've had to get more creative about hiding them. The contortions he goes through to open the cabinet are incredible. Naturally when he finds a bag he opens it himself, and he doesn't use the zip lock seal, or follow the recommended limit of no more than six treats at a time.<br /><br />Try a small bag to see if your cats like them, but I'm now buying them in bulk.<br /><br />They like them better than catnip."

This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!"

These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of ""Beer Nuts"" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'"

I carry them around in a ziplock bag for the much needed sugar rush at school and they get more chewy after about an hour out of the fridge.  Another bonus is that unlike some other bears they taste like candy and not fruit snacks -  and hey, why pretend to be something that you're not."
07	37314,B003CK2BQG,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,3/31/07,3,3,4,"Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value","****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****"

The other reviewer is correct - they are on the sweet side.  I love them.  I keep one in my purse at all times.  There are more than 3 varieties made, but they are the only 3 Amazon carries.  The yogurt covered bars are even sweeter - but I love those too."

One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other ""Jamaica grown"" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price."
07	37315,B003CK2BQG,A4TAYDT1ZW49D,2/13/07,3,3,4,Very good for what it is,"We've been ""product testing"" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama ""Sushi Bar"" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea ""taste"" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. ""Sushi Bar""-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff."

We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have ""that talk"".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!"

The all-natural raw foods approach makes for a great snack bar - not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner - but the lemon flavor here is definitely not subtle.  I still enjoyed the box, but prefer the cherry pie or banana cookie flavors."

Didn't see this as much of a problem until they worked their way onto my roof and into every open cavity in my house.  Sealing these openings didn't eliminate their presence entirely.  Cutting back tree access worked to some extent, but the ones who really wanted to get back on the roof would ultimately find a way.<br /><br />Shortly after discovering that my gutter had become a nesting area for the squirrels, I declared war on the critters, and picked up both the Critter Ridder spray and granules.  I generously applied the granules to the roof and gutter areas, and the spray to the trunks of all the trees that they would frequent.<br /><br />The next morning, there were no signs of squirrels anywhere near my house.  Sure, my trees smelled of pepper for a day or two, but the Critter Ridder worked in helping me relocate these little buggers to someone else's yard.<br /><br />Will it work for your raccoon problems? - NO IDEA.  But it did send my squirrels to another, more-welcoming, part of town.  And when one returns, a healthy reapplication of the spray seems to get rid of them for another few weeks."

07	89240,B000E1FZ4Q,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,5/21/07,11,12,5,Comparing Kraft's 'Deluxe' mac & cheese dinners,"Amazon sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found:<br /><br />The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVRK"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>).<br /><br />The Sharp Cheddar flavor (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1DSMC"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Sharp Cheddar, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste.<br /><br />The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, ut when you try it side by side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it.<br /><br />But it's this one, the Four Cheese meal, that's the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable.<br /><br />These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference."

They are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them. I buy them in bulk and love other Hodgson Mill products as well.<br /><br />  If you eat nothing but white flour products and can't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture, then this is not the product for you. If you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product. I still love to have my junk food (Pillsbury and Hershey's here I come!!!) I just try to have it only on very special occasions. The rest of the time I choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds.

But, he doesn't play with any of his toys everyday. I'm so glad that I bought this for him, it has been a great purchase. He still loves it and loves to play with it regardless of treats being in there or not. If your dog is active, smart, loves to pounce and dig this is a great toy option. Is every dog going to love it....no but you can't get a promise of that with any toy! I highly suggest you give this toy a try."

I was worried it might be too big for my little Maltese, but he LOVES this toy!  I especially use it when I'm going to be gone for a couple hours because I know it will keep him entertained and happy.  If we're going out for dinner, I put the dog's dinner portion of dry food (very small morsels) into the jug so he can play and eat while we're away.  I had been using empty bottles from bottled water for him, but they begin to splinter and break up after a couple of days and I worried about him swallowing broken bits of plastic (NOT good for the tummy!).  I don't have to worry about that with this VERY durable bottle.  It seems by looking at it that it would be impossible for the dog to get treats out of it, but my guy figured out within a day how to get out every last one.  A truly super item!"

Like one of the other reviewers, at first my dog was not entirely convinced that the toy was his to play with, as he had never been given access to a bottle before.  After the scent of the treats lured him in, he began to play.  It took little time for him to realize that the rope was what was getting in the way of the treating plopping out, so he just set about chewing on the rope until he succeeded in chewing it in half.  After this happened, the shorter knotted end fell into the jug, and the treats came out easily.  Now I am left with an -a-Jug, as the ""tug"" is missing.  We left the remaining 1/2 of the rope in the jug so that there would be some resistance to the treats just falling out.  A tennis balls works well too.  I'm hoping to find a replacement rope to string through the jug, however they are often knotted so tightly, I've not yet had any success there.  Overall, a great toy that continues to entertain my dog, despite the fact that he re-engineered the main mechanism in the first 30 minutes."

07	21956,B000KV61FC,AP7Y6HYTYF7XX,3/24/07,6,6,5,Entertaining!,"Just a word of advice:  If your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up.  If they aren't, it probably is not the toy for your dog.<br /><br />At first, my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy.  It took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was ""his"".  Once I finally got him used to realizing it was his own, he saw me put his kibble in it.  Then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it.  Granted, the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value.  Now, it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes. He'll do anything for treats.  Although, I'm not sure that he really, really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. I think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats.  I like interactive toys :)<br /><br />On the other hand, our little dog, still doesn't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy.  Just a guess, he probably never will figure it out.  So, some dogs will take to it, and others will look at you like you're crazy for giving them a toy that doesn't squeak!"

When it came I had my family do a blind taste test for me. It actually tastes pretty similar to the Collins, both are sweet and taste like almonds. But the Teisseire has an additional nutty or earthy flavor that the Collins does not. It's made from almond extract, not just flavoring, and sugar, not corn syrup, and nothing with a scary chemical name.<br /><br />It does cost almost twice as much, plus shipping, but it takes me months to go through a bottle so it's worth it for me. It has a very nice pour spout that eliminates the crusty buildup you get on a screw-top bottle like Collins. My only complaint is the metal container. You can't see how much is left, and I think glass would be less likely to impart a taste. Right now there is no metallic taste at all, but in six months who knows?<br /><br />Note that the Amazon listing is wrong in a couple ways. The bottle is metal, not plastic, and the name is spelled ""Teisseire."" Yes, I know it looks plastic in the photo, but it really is metal shaped like that."

In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week."

At one point, I even saw a fly on this fly trap and thought it was caught, but now it's gone. I even have pictures to prove it."

I recently found this product and recommend it highly.<br /><br />One teabag makes a large pitch of this pleasant, mild tea.  It's taste reminds me a bit of Sugar Smacks without the sugar, or even Sheerios.  Doesn't sound like a good taste for tea you say?  Well, you'd be suprised.  A co-worker who tasted it said it reminds her of coffee, which I can see too.<br /><br />Recent studies have shown it has many health benefits, including the ability to improve the fludity of the blood.  I'm not sure how that translates into overall well being, but I know that drinking it makes me feel healthy, and I enjoy the flavor.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea (sorry, had to), but it is worth trying at least once I'd say.  I have a container at work and I sip iced Barley tea throughout the day."

That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference and, as an added bonus, I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't like it! My only quibble with the senior formulation of this great food is that it is very dry - I really do recommend that you add at least a touch of a good oil and water to it to prevent dry skin - dogs get most of their hydration from food."

It is not as sweet as some, so those who do not like sugar-induced psychosis will appreciate these snacks.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is ok, but I found myself rather quickly bored with them.

We've enjoyed the noodles with spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and casseroles.  For texture and taste these cannot be beat for those needing something gluten free due to Celiac disease or other reasons.  Everyone in the family is willing to eat these noodles.

07	26193,B0058AMY74,ABCXJIXC6Q6EB,11/5/07,3,4,5,awesome chips,these are the best chips out there.. nothing can beat this taste. if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this.. once you eat it you wont stop..addicting stuff
07	26192,B0058AMY74,A1GV4HEM6XZC06,12/17/07,3,4,5,These chips tasted good,These chips were good. I ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good. I am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do.
07	72806,B001ET5Y52,A1QIJNLCXVSKCO,1/8/07,1,1,5,Another Newman Success,I've never been disappointed in a Newman product.  They are always quality products.  These prunes are great.  I like to prepare a few days servings of prunes in yogurt.  The prunes get soft and juicy in the yogurt.  They are also great to snack on.
07	26190,B0058AMY74,A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I,5/3/07,1,1,5,yummy for your tummy,"The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips."
07	26189,B0058AMY74,A2F7GUZ4UMVHFL,8/11/07,1,1,5,Great strong flavor,"I agree with the company motto ""A Natural Obsession"".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food."

07	72804,B001ET5Y52,A355ZDZIF6DTN5,5/8/07,1,1,5,These prunes are the best! They're not dry anymore!,"Other reviewers said these prunes are dry, but they aren't anymore! They must have changed the way they process/package them. Now they come in a pouch, rather than the round tub, and you are supposed to refrigerate after opening. I didn't with the first pouch and they were fine though. I bought these prunes before because they are organic, $ goes to charity and they are a lot less expensive than at Whole Foods, but now I also buy them because they are moist, yummy and the best!"

07	9515,B0001M10OW,A1SO1PGDNVMLXC,11/5/07,5,5,5,The best baking powder you can buy.,"If you go to the Rumford web site, you will see this:<br /><br />""In 1859, Eben Norton Horsford (1818-1893), a co-founder of The Rumford Company, formulated and patented Rumford Baking Powder, the first calcium phosphate baking powder. [...] Rumford Baking Powder quickly became widely accepted since it achieved more dependable results and was less expensive than using crude formulas of cream of tartar and baking soda. The calcium acid phosphate in Rumford Baking Powder was also considered to be healthier than cream of tartar.""<br /><br />I had really disliked baking with regular baking powder since it was soapy and bitter tasting.  This powder has no such problems and it works great.  Also, it has no aluminum in it, unlike most commercial baking powders.  I discovered that many chefs and professional bakers use it, so I was happy to find a superior alternative to the regular, common baking powders on the market."
07	45457,B000LKVHOW,A21RK5ZLCXWZRL,5/11/07,19,21,4,Great Gluten-Free Bread by Namaste,"After trying several recipes for gluten-free bread, I find many taste<br /><br />like cardboard.  Namaste makes a great mix which I found is made even better<br /><br />by adding fennel and rye seeds to it.  Very tasty.  I highly recommend all the<br /><br />Namaste products.  I have tried and love the pizza mix, the waffle mix which I make blueberry pancakes out of,<br /><br />and the chocolate cake mix which I make cupcakes out of.  That way I can<br /><br />freeze some for later.  All mixes are free of: gluten, wheat, potato, soy,<br /><br />dairy and casein, but not free of taste!"
07	84599,B000FK63IS,ATIAD2WL24IPS,10/21/07,5,5,5,The BEST gluten free pasta!,Tinkyada makes the best gluten free pasta.  We tried many other brands before this and most were mushy.  This pasta is excellent.  My entire family loves it!
07	81941,B001EQ5HPW,AB05XMZ1Z8MMS,9/17/07,4,5,5,Delicious AND Crunchy!!!,"Has a nice apple & cinnamon flavor!!<br /><br />Previous reviewer did not read the description, as it states the bars are in two-packs, and the bars are crunchy.  I break the bars into three pieces before opening the pack, makes it easier to eat.<br /><br />This is one of the harder to find flavors of Nature Valley Granola Bars.  Most of the time you'll see the Oats N Honey, Peanut Butter, and Maple as the only flavors stocked in stores.  I was lucky to find a local grocery which sells these, in addition to the Pecan flavor."
07	60994,B0002I0GTA,A14WMAUMDTGE4A,1/28/07,0,0,3,The brand is great but the flavor didn't go over well with the mutts....,I love this brand of dog food but the pups just didn't like this particular flavor....
07	12407,B000FBM3YK,A1A0MBT5LKK8U9,12/8/07,2,2,5,Awesome butter cookies!!!,These are every bit as good as the other two reviewers stated. Awesome butter cookies!!! There's a lot of butter taste in these cookies and they're not overly sweet. Just right! I'll be buying again when the 12 pack runs out. Amazon please make sure you keep these in stock on a continuing basis!
07	57880,B000EVOSE4,A1D0Z9S5EF71N5,12/17/07,2,2,3,"Haribos are the BEST, however....","Haribos are my all-time favorite gummy bears.  I was really excited that it came in such a big amount.  HOWEVER, when the gummy bears arrived, they didn't taste or feel fresh.  When I first opened them, it was hard and chewy.  I guess it's always best to buy in person and feel them before you buy them. =)"
07	37335,B003CK2BQG,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,2/26/07,2,2,5,Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor,"I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!"
07	57881,B000EVOSE4,A19HR5KZRCT55K,6/22/07,2,2,3,Rubber Bears,"I had purchased these supposed gummy bears in the store and they were great. I figured since buying so many I would go for the bigger bag. Bad mistake. They are very very rubbery, not fresh like the store. I also purchase the licorice wheels which I must say are excellent. We never know how long these items are in stock on a site like this. The licorice was a back order so I imagine they were made fresh."
07	37336,B003CK2BQG,A2GOE7ITDGYVE,1/4/07,4,5,4,very tasty but bags leak the very finely crushed leaves,Before trying this tea I'd been drinking the packets my husband brought home from Japan. The stash had the same nutty flavor of the good japanese green tea but the bags were fragile and leaked tea leaf into the cup. Just a personal pet peeve. I bought the Stash green tea based on a review I read in Men's Health magazine that rated Stash as having the highest level of anti oxidents (and Caffeine) in those tested.
07	3688,B000ER1DIM,A13A0EE7L3YZNB,2/6/07,1,1,5,My Baby and Toddler Love These,And they are good for them! With whole wheat flower and no high fructose corn syrup like a lot of other crackers.
07	76773,B0049ULB78,A86BBGM0BWI3L,1/8/07,1,1,5,great if you can get it,This is the BEST coffee for the Keurig coffee maker. The ONLY problem with it seems to be getting it. The stores in my area and now Amazon don't seem to have it! Must be because it's SO GOOD!!!
07	76772,B0049ULB78,ACF0R20MDK259,3/7/07,1,1,4,good cup of joe,We have tried many different kinds of k cup coffee.  This is one of my favorite.  It is very strong and has a great flavor.  It is similar to the bold flavor of a americano
07	76771,B0049ULB78,A2N3TWRCHCH0UI,12/7/07,1,1,3,Not Bad,Strong coffee with average coffee taste.  In the Starbucks category as I see it.

She says it is delicious.  We love namaste products because they don't make her sick and they all taste good.  How awsome that now I can buy them for so much less at Amazon I was paying $6 a bag a the local co-op.
07	35784,B000O7IVKK,A22QATUZUP01TT,11/7/07,5,30,1,Healthy? Don't kid yourself.,"Sorry, but this product is NOT HEALTHY. The word ""organic"" only means that the ingredients were grown with out certain chemicals, such as pesticides and hormones. So if you must eat Kraft mac-n-cheese, this is a better choice than regular. But, the word ""organic"" does not mean nutritious! Boxed mac-n-cheese isn't a nutritious choice for growing kids and, organic or not, it's a highly processed food (hint: it still has powered cheese). This food is very high in saturated fat and sodium. Plus, it doesn't contain any whole grains. Kids would be much better off getting their protein and calcium, which this product does contain, from foods not so high in saturated fats! Almost all kids really will eat, and even enjoy, whole-grain pasta, lower fat milk, 2% cheese and many other truly nutritious foods when parents make (or buy) easy, yummy and kid-friendly healthy choices!<br />P.Gould, author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family"

Is this mold or some ingredient?  I don't know, but it doesn't look nice.  I am contacting customer service to ask about returning this VERY EXPENSIVE dog food. I expect the return process will be a pain, but my dog got sick after the first can so I won't give her any more.  From now on it's HOME COOKING for my German Sheperd!"
07	20190,B000F42ECI,A7D25NQ3MHNNJ,1/9/07,2,2,5,"Goodness gracious, good morning!!",Taylor's of Hargate Irish Breakfast tea is the only way to start you day.  The flavor is robust without being overdone and offers the little caffine kick I know I need to jump-start my morning.  Taylor's Tea also is lovely in the afternoon with a little sweet something.  Fine tea.
07	49055,B000GFYRJ4,A1SOL4MV20NK42,5/25/07,8,8,5,Number one!,"Bigelow isn't the cheapest tea around, but they are the best tasting (Altho I like Twinings' Earl Grey blend better than Bigelow's). Foil packs keep them fresh tasting pretty much forever. Lemon Lift's hint of spicy lemon is always a hit with company, and has won over many coffee drinkers. Also great, and hard to find in stores, is Bigelow's Chinese Fortune. Plantation mint, for spearmint lovers, is great in the Summer months. I know this sounds like a commercial, but Bigelow deserves it!"

My dogs and I always ate gummi bears and now that they are both gone I still enjoy eating them especially before bed.  I have a hard time finding them in the local stores so I am so glad I found them online.  Thanks again and I will be ordering again soon.

In texture and taste they are exactly like classic pecan pie filling. These things are so good I wrote the company fan mail. Hopefully they will not respond with a restraining order, I was pretty effusive. If you like pecan pie you should be pretty impressed by these bars."
07	69244,B0018KR8V0,A36YK9Y34NE7BI,7/17/07,5,5,5,Packs a big lemony punch,"As other reviewers have noted, when they say lemon flavor they mean lemon flavor.  But, my God, are they ever good!  I've tried the cherry and the apple but the lemon are my favorites.  You might even get your kids to eat them.<br /><br />The ingredient list is the kicker--only five items (dates, cashews, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, natural lemon flavor).  Not a bunch of artificial flavors, high-fructose corn syrup, preservatives and the like."

The only prob. is that I adore these, but cherries are heavily sprayed...so if you're looking for Organic foods, you're better off with the Think Organic cherry nut bars.  The problem THERE is that I am somewhat allergic to Cashews and the Think Org. bars are loaded with them!  Larabars  use Almonds, which is no problem for allergies, just for chemical sprays.<br /><br />Darn it, guys, why doesn't someone come up with a relatively hypoallergenic product that is also ORGANIC????  When you do, your bars will be my most favored product of the century!!! Otherwise, the Cherry Pie Larabars are unbelievably yummy and raw food, which is always good."

We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now.  The ""cheese"" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.  I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse.  Either way, beware."

This one is all-natural, and has no preservatives -- sure, it's going to get a bit tough once it's open.  To combat that, just put the bowl of cereal (dry) into the microwave for 20 - 30 seconds... let cool, and then enjoy - voila!  (This can be done with any cereal that goes stale, btw).<br /><br />It's really good combined with yogurt and fruit.<br /><br />Seriously, don't compare this with the over-processed, preservative-laden stuff in the grocery stores.

07	35464,B000E7YPPK,A36GEDLB5A5MJ,5/12/07,0,0,4,Perfectly edible Pad Thai,"Although the preparation instructions could've been a little better (for instance, soaking the rice noodles in hot tap water just wasn't sufficient:  I really needed to do what another brand of Pad Thai for two had suggested, and pour BOILING water over them to ensure that they softened sufficiently to be ready to stir-fry when my wok and vegetables were ready), I was quite satisfied with the quality of Pad Thai I was able to make with this kit, even using canned bean sprouts instead of fresh.<br /><br />I followed the instructions mostly, though I was careful not to overcook the thawed raw shrimp I used for protein and omitted adding chopped peanuts (which I didn't have on hand) at the end.  With an egg, some canned bean sprouts (though fresh are always better if you can get them and use them quickly), and chopped green onions, plus some small shrimp thawed overnight, I was able to turn this into a very satisfying main dish for two."

07	76708,B0049ULB78,A2CSZ87RO4912T,1/15/07,5,8,5,Magical,"A slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so-called extra bold varieties. The finish is crisp, clean, and ultimately satisfying.  After several cups, one begins to contemplate that there might be an even darker, more fulfilling blend out there somewhere, perhaps being plucked from deep within a jungle or rain forest, or the side of a volcano.  Perchance there is, but until that is discovered, I must continue to let the magic wash across my taste buds, and deal with the sadness that follows the completion of a cup, knowing that the next cup has yet to be poured.<br /><br />Salut."

I use to be a Dunkin Donuts fan, not since I have tried this blend.  I now brew my own to take on the road instead of paying $1.85 a cup at DD.  If you like strong bold coffee flavor without a bitter taste, this is the one for you."
07	69258,B0018KR8V0,A2W5G8XX9GRER3,1/5/07,3,3,5,These are the best,"I heard about these bars from the author of The Lupus Recovery Diet.  She<br /><br />sent me a bar with my recent CD purchase and I loved it.  I have since purchased bars at Whole Foods and was so pleased to see them offered here.<br /><br />The Pecan Pie tastes so wonderful.  Just like a piece of pecan pie.  My<br /><br />favorites are the cinnamon roll and chocolate coconut.<br /><br />I read the other review regarding calories and fat, but these bars are healthy and so filling.  I have one for breakfast on the run, or as a mid<br /><br />afternoon snack.  With a plant based diet, I am not concerned about the calories and find the bars so satisfying. These are the best tasting bars I have ever tried.  It sounds like a commercial, but I honestly am in love with this product.  I have ordered 4 cases for our household.  My kids love them too and they are way better than the cookies and other sweet processed snacks offered for lunches."
07	11274,B000E21Z7Q,AA1FT4TM1WU1Z,2/6/07,2,2,5,Awesome Protein Crunch!,"These are a tasty alternative to carb-heavy regular pretzels. I rely on Kay's Naturals to help me in my high protein diet. I would have these for breakfast every day if I could. I'm sad that I have to order them online, however. They should be available everywhere. Kids should be getting these in school vending machines, instead of the evil crap that is now available. THESE ROCK!"

Lots of good stuff in this Brownie,  but the flax taste is a little strong.  I really feel no guilt when having a Brownie snack for me or my kids."
07	3071,B000FDKQCO,A1F14BB4PV053A,2/18/07,2,2,5,Love 'em!!,"I really like this brownie mix.  Unfortunately my local grocer has stopped carrying them - hence buying them from Amazon!!  They are easy to prepare and bake up very nicely.  Very moist and I think it has just the right amount of chocolate flavor.  Yes, they are healthy and are more dense than traditional brownies - but they fill my chocolate craving better and I really feel like I have eaten dessert - not just some fluff from a box.  [...]"

She had been taking Rimadyl for back problems, but due to some other health problems could no longer take that long term.

07	52234,B000M7NH8I,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,1/13/07,1,1,5,"Great Immune Booster, Yummy and Unusual Tasting Tea","*****<br /><br />This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement.""<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, ""When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day.""<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

07	35465,B000E7YPPK,A2D8309OZGMGGG,4/8/07,0,0,3,Average taste. Don't expect Authenticity in a box,"I am an avid eater of Thai Food, so I was curious to see how this Pad Thai in a box would taste. Considering the price, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Ease of cooking: 3 stars. It's a tough trick to gauge when the noodles have been soaked long enough to get the perfect firmness. Also, you have to use and wash multiple pots to make this. One pot to boil the water for the noodles. And a frying pan to stir fry the noodles in.<br /><br />Taste: It's in a box. How much can you expect? Albeit, taste might have been better if I added some fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and shrimp or chicken.<br /><br />Price: Not bad considering it's a third of what  you would pay for compared to take out.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars. This is like the cup o noodle of Pad Thai. Decent enough to consume if you really run out of food, but not something you'll be craving during lunch hour."

07	40809,B000RY5EVO,AKMEEW57PC4F1,7/8/07,2,2,5,"Try it, you'll love it!!","I grew up in Norwich, NY eating chicken spiedies every year at the New York State Fair. In my high school years I discovered a mom and pop take-out restaurant in Endicott that sold both the grilled skewers of marinated chicken and tubs of ready to grill raw meat. Rapture! Later the sauce showed up in local grocery stores. Now that I have left central NY, I am thrilled to be able to buy this from Amazon.<br /> Unfamiliar to most, this sauce is vinegar and oil based and the bottle is about half full of herbs, garlic and other seasonings. It is not tomato or sugar-based so that it won't flare up or burn. You can throw this stuff on any almost any meat(I prefer chicken), let it marinate for a few hours then grill it up! Easy."
07	35466,B000E7YPPK,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,4/7/07,0,0,3,Okay but...,"There's nothing wrong with this packaged mix, but it's just approximately 8 ounces of rice noodle and an ounce of tamarind sauce;  you must provide all the other ingredients.<br /><br />Rice noodles are cheap, and the sauce is just tamarind paste, sugar, and soy sauce--you can keep a jar of tamarind paste in the fridge for months.  For what this costs, you can get pounds and pounds of rice noodle and several jars of tamarind paste.  Since you have to prepare and add all of the other ingredients anyway, it only takes a couple of minutes to make the sauce, too."

I also recommend using this as a soup instead, so put the noodles in a bowl with water in the microwave, get the water hot and then add the pouch of sauce.  Add some veggies and maybe some soy sauce and then it's actually pretty good.  But if you do it based on the instructions, the noodles won't cook all the way and it's a bit plain."

I have tried to get as much raw food in my diet as possible and these really help.<br /> As for the calories, I see a lot of people commenting on this. As a dancer I am required to keep my weight down and so I know a thing or two about calories but these are not that high in calories if eaten as a meal replacement or a high energy snack in the afternoon. Remember these are made with a lot of nuts which are full of good fat, protein, and low on the glycemic index. Cherry and Lemon are my favorite flavors. Yum!"

This soup is no exception.  The only problem is that it is exceedingly high in sodium, fat, cholesterol and calories in general. Per servings totals are 200 calories, total fat 11g, saturated fat 8g, cholesterol 30 mg, sodium 540 mg! This sodium total is 22% of what you should get for the whole day!  By comparison, Campbell's Chicken with Rice soup has 70 calories, total fat 1.5g, saturated fat .5g, cholesterol 5 mg, sodium 820 mg.  Almost double the sodium (salt) but much healthier in every other category.  The bottom line is, if you want healthy soup, make it yourself."

McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning.

I also like the energy pick me up in the morning.  It keeps me awake if I drink it at night.  It does, in fact, seem to aid digestion, especially at high altitudes.

The other reviewer is right, it really does have a distinctive, delicate taste and I also prefer it piping hot with a little sugar, although my husband wants to try it iced.  This is a must-have for tea drinkers, and it's quite lovely in that it gives a nice pick-me-up with no aftereffects like caffeine."
07	61227,B000HAAAKI,AZX8GYVUB78TE,9/10/07,6,6,5,"Windsor , mate De Coca","Much has already be said about this fine product and it would be hard to<br />add  to all the existing great  reviews. I find this excellent product<br />to be complementary to Yerba Mate as well. I combine the two mates by<br />making strong yerba mate  sun tea and then steeping the coca tea bags in the first sun tea ( once again in the sun ) making  Cocayerb Mate. For my tastes the two work well in concert, I find that the properties of both mates combine nicely.<br />  I add a small amount of sugar to my cocayerb mate because I drink it as a dark tea. Cocayerb might be a little intense for those people that don't like coffee due to it's stimulating effects. The speed and efficiency of the Amazon ordering and delivery process is very  commendable as  well."

But then I found Amazon has it and life is good again.  Coffee gives you the jitters and caffeine actually strips you body of vitamins, none of this with Coca Tea.  In truth the Coca Leaf has proteins, vitamins and minerals essential to your body. Ingesting the leaf is NOT addictive and is in fact very healthy.  It is a bit expensive but ones health is worth it.  Besides the Tea tastes wonderful without side effects like upset stomach, jitters, etc. of caffeine!"

They are small enough so you do not have to worry about your dog gaining weight if you use them often.  I have used them exclusively to potty train my Basset Hounds.

But they're too sweet.  The sugary taste and texture of this brand of dried strawberries makes me feel like I'm eating candied strawberries.  This wasn't what I expected from the description.  I should have paid more attention to the other review that complains of over-sweetening.  Don't buy these, unless you want to eat strawberry candy; buy another brand which lets you enjoy the natural strawberry flavor and texture more."

Cocoa Mole' is such a great flavor- nice and chocolatey with a kick of chili pepper- works great as a mid-morning snack!  I like almost all the other Larabar flavors- except the banana which is kind of bland.  Can hardly wait to try the Key Lime Pie and the Pistachio flavors.

I use them all the time for training (walking on a lead, sitting, fetching).  They are high in flavor so even with our 7 month Golden Retriever, treats cut in half work well for a reward.  Unlike dog kibble or other treats, these are quickly digested so that your dog will not be gagging on them as he/she works on the next behavior.  To keep fresh, keep bag tightly closed and put a portion of the cut treats in a resealable sandwich bag.  If they do get exposed to air and dry out, a small portion of a moistened paper towel in the bag will restore them to original texture."

Strangely, despite all the extra packaging (and waste), Amazon makes it cheaper to buy it this way then in the 5-pack of larger canisters ($7/lb versus $9.30). They should lower the canister prices!"

I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."

When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree or the RIEME French vanilla syrup.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the ""universal medicine.""  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy.""<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"

The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best."
07	11416,B00025691M,AYQ8RLE0K6RU8,8/23/07,0,0,4,3 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."

07	67142,B0000CGFSC,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,2/1/07,1,1,5,"Distinctive, great-flavored Japanese tea","*****<br />Ashby's Japanese Green Tea is a distinctive, strong, great-flavored Japanese tea. Nothing wimpy or mild about it, and I'm glad, because it's so enjoyable. I made a large thermos with one tea bag, left the tea bag in, and drank it for several hours, and it never got bitter. I then made more tea with the same tea bag. The flavor is definitely Asian and I could drink cup after cup. It smells great, too.<br /><br />Ashby's of London writes this about Japanese Green Tea: ""From Japan, this pan-fired tea is lightly rolled and dried over a fire in a large flat bottom pan. This tea contains the desirable ""Polyphenols"" that have been reported to be a cancer fighting substance. It has a very light, fresh taste and produces a transparent greenish colored brew."" I agree, but please note that the tea is distinctively flavored, not mild (which I really like) and delivers a wonderful tea experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and if you enjoy Asian teas, or want a true green tea, you'll not go wrong here.<br />*****"

The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)"

I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies."

07	56739,B000KFU6RW,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,3/5/07,6,6,4,Antioxidant Refresher,"****<br /><br />This Pomegranate Green Tea from Yogi Tea is an antioxidant refresher. It's an all natural tea made from organic green tea leaf, organic hibiscus flowers, organic flavors, organic peppermint leaf, pomegranate juice powder, stevia leaf, organic burdock root, and organic dandelion root. The taste is mild, only very slightly tasting of pomegranate, tasting mostly just of green tea, with a very pleasant aroma; in fact, it's so mild, that I would definitely use two tea bags and brew it for the full six minutes. It does not get bitter. Unless you enjoy very mild tea, you should plan on getting fewer cups of tea from the box. For this reason I gave this tea only four stars.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Pomegranate Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Pomegranate helps reinvigorate the body through the neutralization of harmful free radicals. Delicious Pomegranate provides this tea with a powerful dose of natural antioxidants and exciting fruit flavor. This cherished fruit contains polyphenols, chemical compounds that include Epigallo-catechin-3 gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that is nearly 100 times more potent than vitamin C and 25 times more potent than vitamin E. A favorite of the Mediterranean peoples for centuries, Pomegranate has also been linked to nourishing the skin, supporting healthy cholesterol levels already in the normal range and promoting cardiovascular health. Like Pomegranate, Organic Green Tea also supplies polyphenols that help ward off free radicals. In fact, a single cup of Green Tea has been shown to provide greater antioxidant support than a serving of broccoli, spinach or strawberries. To further complement this healing formula, we've included the detoxifying qualities of Organic Burdock and Organic Dandelion, as well as the gentle essence of Organic Peppermint. Enjoy a cup of refreshing Green Tea Pomegranate and feel renewed with the benefits of nature's most powerful antioxidants.""<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Pomegranate Green Tea has contains approximately 30 mg of caffeine per tea bag, which is just one third of what is normally found in an 8 oz cup of coffee.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting. Recommended.<br /><br />****"

It comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter.  We have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine.  I did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so I guess I didn't buy the right thing.

These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain ""yeast extract."" On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."

Even chewing is too much work for me.  Given that, Primal Strips are heaven.  The texture is very close to meat, but is consistently chewable, with none of the gristle often associated with beef jerky.  Spam is too gooey.  Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently.  But this?  This is perfect.  If ""they"" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown-type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind.  I'm not sure of the health benefits.  I guess it's good for me.  I've seen people who are healthier than I eating it, so I figure it's nutritious.  Anyway, it tastes robust, has a perfect texture, and is a perfect snack."

This is seitan, which is a chewy gluten product.  It is stringy in texture, moist, and is a good match for the flavors.  There are some flavors I don't particularly like, such as the lime flavor, but even the ones I don't like seem like someone else would. (As in, I don't like barbecue potato chips, but I can see where someone else would.)"
07	5582,B000G1X45G,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,12/19/07,6,7,5,The taste is as good as the aroma,I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!

The ""Organic Premium"" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better."

The shipping box had no padding; soup was spilled from a couple of the sacks....and there seems to be teeth marks in the sacks of soup....so,upon openning the package, I immediately,emailed Amazon asking them to get this soup out of my kitchen.

07	64696,B000E0C7Z2,A2IBEM8O86BBLL,8/29/07,5,5,4,Delicious with some Tweaking!,"This hot chocolate is delicious with some tweaking. I originally bought it because I cannot find hot chocolate in the store that does not contain any hydrogenated oils or a ton of sugar. Nestle is the only one who doesn't in their fat-free mix, but then you have the nasty artificial sweetners to deal with. I was ecstatic when I came across this (hopefully a dream come true) on Amazon and ordered it.<br /><br />I have to admit, my first batch wasn't very good. I followed the directions, and found the hot chocolate to be very strong. I like more of a milky chocolatey taste as opposed to a dark chocolatey taste in my hot chocolate.<br /><br />I consume sugar very sparingly, so I used both liquid and powdered Stevia with this chocolate. It produced okay results, but nothing really spectacular. I love Dagoba chocolate bars, so was expecting to be ""wowed"" by the hot chocolate, too. I was a little disappointed when I wasn't.<br /><br />I was camping on my third try making this chocolate, and gave up on the Stevia. I made the batch with half of the chocolate called for, and the only other item I had on hand that was sweet (I don't carry sugar)  was a bottle of organic pure maple syrup. I added a teaspon ot two of this to my cup, and voila! It was a totally different experience.<br /><br />After only adding half of the chocolate called for, and using both Stevia and a little bit of pure maple syrup, was this chocolate exceptional.<br /><br />I was finally able to taste the true colors and depth of this delicious chocolate. It kind of reminded me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate because it has so much going on with it as far as the colors and depth go. Mexican chocolate is very flavorful, and this chocolate is too, with tweaking.<br /><br />Also, be sure to whisk the chocolate *very* well when heating up the milk (or other milk-type beverage) or you will end up with big clumps of unsweetened, unmelted chocolate in your cup. As it stands, when I whisk and whisk and whisk, I still get small clumps of chocolate in my cup.<br /><br />I rated this 4 stars because after tweaking, the choclate was delicious. If I hadn't had to tweak it, it would definitely get 5 stars. I would imagine if you just used sugar, you might not have the problems I had in the beginning."

But after one cold morning of moving a hot tub I was rewarded with Abuelita.  This hot cocoa has tastes of cinnamon and other spices.  I like to add a bit of cayenne or chili powder to it, and it is just delicious."

07	24307,B001E5E2PO,A1SYLII0808HD6,10/26/07,10,16,5,"Adds Depth, Flair, and Dimension to Your Coffee!","Torani, the flavored syrup often presumed to originate from Italy, but actually manufactured in South San Francisco (""The industrial City""--their motto, not mine) makes many delicious flavors, and hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />The hazelnut refers to any nuts from the species of the genus Corylus. While raw hazelnuts can have a bitter taste, their culinary uses are many, extending from common pralines and other candies (including ""Nutella"") to the rarified confections of Europe, such as the justly famous Viennese hazelnut torte. Hazelnut is no stranger to the coffee house scene, and when mixed with vodka, hazelnut liqueurs (Frangelica, most famoulsy) enjoy widespread popularity , both straight and as a topping. Even hazelnut butter is making a stand in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />ALl this is to say that adding hazelnut syrup to your coffee (especially) or perhaps to ice cream, can be vigorously defended against specious attack by foodies: It enjoys a widespread and international esteem. Torani'z hazelnut is a non-alcoholic sweetner whicih imparts discernable hazelnut flavor, and it can add a great deal of depth and flair to an otherwise ordinary coffee drink. It's not as sweet or one-dimensional as the Vanilla flavor, although a higher ratio of hazelnut to sugar would certainly improve the experience. It's relatively inexpensive, so that you can find your favorite flavors for various concoctions. A nice bright bottle, too, often left out for display purposes in the unpretensious bohemian caf&eacute;. There will be those black coffee drinkers, gloating over rejected poetry and stinking Galois, who will scorn the use of such a sweetener; it is perhaps best to leave then alone."

07	61390,B001EO5R04,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,8/5/07,4,4,4,Very Bergamot-y Tea!,"****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"

I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green."

While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6"">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"

The stash had the same nutty flavor of the good japanese green tea but the bags were fragile and leaked tea leaf into the cup. Just a personal pet peeve. I bought the Stash green tea based on a review I read in Men's Health magazine that rated Stash as having the highest level of anti oxidents (and Caffeine) in those tested.

Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!"

While the other reviews tempted me to try it... and i figured my kids would love it (anything with chocolate and peanutbutter is a winner)... i was mightily surprised to find that all the adults ate it before the kids could get any.<br /><br />Very easy to prepare and a quick, light (if you leave off the topping and the crust) dessert that goes great after a pork meal.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for offering it!  i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who enjoys a reeses cup."
07	54342,B001EO5YCA,A1EYGP63HU91PX,6/6/07,4,5,4,Great cereal. Good taste!,This is already a great tasting cereal that's good for you! The peanut butter is just a nice change of pace!
07	40689,B000E48IXS,A2HZFBIX01JTE1,1/2/07,3,4,5,The real thing,"For a taste of good old South African traditional kos, this is great.  It is almost exactly the flavor of the droewors I buy on my visits to SA and provides satisfaction of the yearning for a ""taste of home""."
07	76387,B001HTKOWC,AIVDDGBDF2QO9,1/10/07,7,9,5,Love It!,The white tea blended w/ the green takes the edge off of green's sometimes grassy taste and creates a nice honey colored liqueor.  I drink 5-6 cups a day easy.
07	76386,B001HTKOWC,A4TAYDT1ZW49D,2/13/07,3,3,4,Very good for what it is,"We've been ""product testing"" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama ""Sushi Bar"" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea ""taste"" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. ""Sushi Bar""-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff."
07	76385,B001HTKOWC,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,3/31/07,3,3,4,"Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value","****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****"
07	67174,B001E50X84,A2R6RA8FRBS608,1/21/07,5,8,4,Good food; good snacks !!!,"Sun Maid Raisins provide an excellent snack for persons on the go who want quick energy; they are also healthy for just about anyone, too. They are fat and cholesterol free and they don't have sodium. Raisins contain dietary fiber as well. Moreover, just 1.5 ounces equals one serving of the fruit we need to have in our diets every day. Excellent!<br /><br />The packaging allows for easy transport and the stay fresh reclosable zipper works well. If for some reason the zipper on your bag doesn't work then use a tie from a loaf of bread or something similar to keep the package closed.<br /><br />Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that these raisins are delicious with yogurt and cereal. They can be used in salads and numerous other recipes, too. I add them to hot oatmeal in the morning to give the otherwise bland oatmeal a natural sweetness that wakes up my taste buds big time! SMILES<br /><br />Unfortunately, raisins contain few vitamins and they do contain some carbohydrates. Amazon also notes that these raisins ""may contain an occasional grape stem or wood piece."" Consult your doctor if this concerns you. I wish they contained vitamins; this disappoints me so I will take off one star to make this a four star review.<br /><br />Overall, however, Sun Maid raisins provide us with a healthy alternative to candy bars and junk food when we need that snack or burst of sugar energy. They help us get the fruit we so badly need in our diets and the packaging allows us to carry them around easily.<br /><br />Buy some like I did and ENJOY!!!"

Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market."

07	76374,B001HTKOWC,A276CFPBYBLQNT,1/7/07,7,8,5,Excellent flavor...the best I have tried,"Since I drink between eight and ten cups of green tea a day, I am very fussy about the taste.  It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, ""that is why it is called green tea!"""
07	614,B000G6RYNE,A2F7GUZ4UMVHFL,8/11/07,1,1,5,Great strong flavor,"I agree with the company motto ""A Natural Obsession"".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food."

07	61404,B001EO5R04,A35OD1RKGX6RJK,11/18/07,2,2,4,Great Green Tea,"I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead."

I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****"

In fact, Akmak are what graham crackers want to be when they grow up.  Delightfully crispy, slightly sweet whole grain goodness beyond compare.<br /><br />CONS:<br />This non-retail packaging sucks.  The packaging is two little crackers per package, just like you would get at restaurant. At least half of our crackers were smashed.<br /><br />We bought these through Amazon because the only place that sells these locally is Trader Joe's, which is about 30 miles away.  If the retail packaging is available, buy them that way, otherwise enjoy your crumbs!"

We do, so it is 5 stars.<br /><br />At the time we bought it Amazon was less expensive  than our supermarkets in quantities qualifying for free shipping.<br /><br />Amazon - keep competetive prices coming (not yet common enough) on quality products (frequent) and we will be sold. Ease of ordering and shipping generally excellent. Choice of packaging sometimes bizzare and wasteful, such as a box many times bigger than necessary with loose boxes of tea and crumpled paper filler."

Crunchies are alright, but my packets were a little more chewy than crunchy. perhaps a little stale or this is just how their fruit is. whatever the reason, for the same price, the 'just tomatoes' fruits are more crispy, tart, and delicious."
07	89053,B001EQ5JQO,A1LDQ7NNIWTO2Q,12/16/07,2,2,5,Great price - wonderful product for Pistachio lovers!,"We bought a 4-pack of these when Amazon was having a special of saving $25 when buying $59 or more.  After the savings, these ended up being something like $4 a pound -- which is a great price for Pistachios!  After receiving the first bunch, we ate the first bag in no time and gave away a couple for holiday gifts.  When we were down to the last bag, my wife wanted more -- so we ordered 2 more 4-pack sets and hopefully this time they'll last a little longer.  These are fresh, taste very good and at the price we paid, a real bargain."
07	76348,B001HTKOWC,AMPPPNBMRAEBF,1/30/07,18,20,5,Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best,"After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!"

I always keep these crackers around to add to soups.  However, there are also times when they are the only thing I can properly digest.  This is a great item to have around when having digestive difficulties associated with the flu or stress.  For me they work better than the ""bananas, rice, applesauce or toast"" of the BRAT diet used in relieving IBS. These thin, easy to chew crackers are a really great product."

Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor."
07	56740,B000KFU6RW,A106ZCP7RSXMRU,8/6/07,5,5,4,Nice change of taste and I feel better after a cup!,"I like this green tea. The pomegranate makes for a unique taste and very pretty color also. It contains stevia already so you probably will not need any sweetener added. I have one of these when I feel blah, and the antioxidant properties really do make me feel better. I would give it 5 stars, except I noticed that if I drink it on an empty stomach, I feel a bit queasy. I'm sensitive that way though so it is probably just me, but to make sure I always have a couple of organic crackers first (I recommend Back to Nature crackers). This tea is a definite pantry staple for us."

You don't have to use a lot of coffee, so the can lasts longer than leading brands.  The taste is a non-powerful, strong blend with a subtle vanilla.  Even when the coffee is brewing it's out of this world!<br /><br />Amazon has a great price for this item.  WHEN my store has it on sale, they ask $4.89 for a can, so this is a nice price plus the wonderful free shipping offer.  I received my coffee two days after I ordered it!

For starters, I don't use beef, I use texturized vegetable protein, which, let's face it, needs a little more help than beef to taste good.  This seasoning had multi-layer flavors to it, unlike the taco seasoning stand-bys that taste mainly like chili powder and cayenne pepper.  Flavorful and spicy and not crazy, fire-breathing hot.  The currants or raisins were a little unexpected but incredibly tasty.  However, it is still within the taste  range of taco seasoning so if you are craving tacos - this still satisfies and then some."

It took a year to find a food that he would eat with a little excitement.  If food drops on the kitchen floor he will not touch it.<br /><br />A friend gave my dog one of these treats and he begged for more.  I could not believe it.  He would pass up filet mignon for these treats.  I like them because they have one ingredient, chicken."

However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />""Feullitees Doree,"" which can be bought on in France."

I love all the regular Haribo products but this is one I had never tried.<br /><br />Alas, the sour powder was more of a sugar topping. Not sour at all!<br /><br />Haribo makes good gummy candy, but saying these are sour is quite misleading!"

Unfortunately they have both soy and gluten, which makes them off limits for a lot of people with food sensitivities (lost stars for that). But taste-wise, for everybody else, they are really good! The red sauce comes in hot, medium, and mild, and unlike some 'hot' sauces it doesn't sacrifice taste at all for the heat. The green sauce is very mild. My kid and friends love enchiladas made with either. I eat lowcarb, and often chop up cooked chicken, dice a little pepper/onion, and mix in a little enchilada sauce (sometimes a little cream cheese) and nuke it and stir. Yum."

I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!"

I can't fault this  jerky, but Amazon's shipping folk for that.  However, the bag had jerky in it that had a strange gray fungus growing on it!<br /><br />I was told this was good jerkey, but I guess I'll never know now.

It's really low cal and high protein, so you don't have to feel guilty.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit dry and chewy, that aspect could be improved upon.  Still, I just ordered a bunch more and it's my favourite snack."

What I got was nothing more than packaged corn meal mush, just as easily made at home. It wasn't bad but I expected a little more, tastewise, than what I got. I'll stick with the traditional white hominy grits in the future. Here's hoping that they'll be available on Amazon soon."

Go figure.. Anyway, if I can get it here, I'm happy!  I've tried a bunch of other sauces (La Victoria, El Pato, and a few other off brands) and the others are always too hot (for the rest of the family).. I find the Old El Paso to have the proper amount of mild heat and the great flavor.. I could eat the stuff every day!"

But to send a fresh product, the sellers rely on overnight shipping.  They shipped my packages the night before the holiday, despite a big storm being predicted.  This package got there just fine; my other package was 2 days late.  Sellers were pretty accommodating though, and tried to be fair, so I still give this 4 stars.

The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'."

The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.  The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.  The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet.  Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US.  I'm heading back to Target or Trader Joe's for the real thing."

These cookies... not so much. The brownies are so rich and chocolatey that I raced back to amazon and ordered these cookies. There aren't many chips and the ones that are there look like chocolate chips but they don'r taste like them. I gave it 3 stars because this does make an easy base for gluten/dairy free cookies, just add more of your own dairy free choc chips. The choc in the brownies is the premium Ghiradelli chocolate, so Bob... make the chips in these cookies out of the Ghiradelli too and you'd really have something."

They are YUMMY though!  The mix calls for margarine, but I used butter.  The next time I make them I might add in some more mini chips, but they really are delicious as is.  I think they were even better the day after I made them -- they have a rich texture which was almost like a peanut butter cookie.  I think even people who don't restrict their wheat/gluten intake would really like these."

Not as thin as pretzel sticks, but not as thick as a pretzel rod. Just the right in between. Fresh tasting and not too much salt.<br /><br />Unless you are having a party, one barrel will go a long way. I bought two barrels to save 10% and ended up sending one baarrel to my company's office. Really a lot of pretzels for the money. Will buy them again."

People are vastly over-concerned about MSG: it's a very small percentage of people who may have a legitimate reaction to the stuff, apparently.  Consider that the Japanese put it in tons of their food, and it's all over our food too (anything made with bouillon, for example).<br /><br />This is the best mayo.  It makes everything it touches delicious.  Sometimes I have to force myself not to buy it because we end up putting it on everything, and I worry at the thought of consuming that much mayo (ie, for fat and cholesterol reasons, but msg concerns).<br /><br />Try this, you'll be hooked."

She cannot have gluten in her diet and that makes meals for family get-togethers difficult to plan-- especially when it comes to desserts. I mixed up a batch (using real butter instead of margarine) and was a little worried when the batter stayed dry and just looked like loose crumbs in the bowl. But like the package says, it sticks into balls when you press together in your hands. I also have to admit that I tasted the raw batter ( I can't resist!) and it tasted funny, so again I was worried. When they came out of the oven they looked a little dry (worried again) but when they cooled off and I tasted them I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor. My mother-in-law will definitely be pleased."

I have become allergic to tomatoes, but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy."

My order just came in today and we couldn't wait to try them. My son has been put on a gluten-free diet for his allergies so we thought our world had been turned upside down. Since we had been so happy with Bob's Red Mill GF Wonderful Bread Mix, we decided to try this cookie mix. As I was mixing the ingredients it just didn't look right (compared to a regular gluten cookie mix) and the batter tasted very strange. But once they were cooked I couldn't believe how delicious they were! So I guess the moral to the story is ""don't judge a cookie by its batter"" -- heehee! This mix will certainly be a new favorite for both the gluten-free and gluten eaters in our home! And boy am I glad we ordered 4 of these from Amazon--I have a feeling we'll be making more this weekend. Heehee!"

The flavor starts to come through very quickly - creamy and aromatic.<br /><br />It's certainly the easiest way to get the full mango flavor experience without the mess.  The quality is consistent - you don't get the odd funny-tasting piece like you do with other dried fruits.<br /><br />This is a terrific snack.  The chewiness makes each bite last, and the flavor just keeps coming.  You can easily make a single serving size last 5 minutes, and there aren't many snack foods that can match that!"

One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other ""Jamaica grown"" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price."

I'm always on the lookout for new gum since I like having something to chew while I'm driving. I came across this back in august and was pleasantly surprised. The flavor lasts a really long time and is relatively strong.

Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities."

The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea..."

I must say, it was one of the best cups of hot chocolate I've had in a long time.<br />I've tried soooo many different brands....from the most expensive to the least expensive. This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You'll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it's simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won't be disappointed!"

I switched to whole wheat pasta a few years ago and this is one of the best alternatives that fit the traditional American dish. I mix it with a can of tuna and I could eat it every night of the week. You do have to cook the noodles longer because they are more dense than the processed enriched noodles you get at the store. I've managed to convert my husband to the whole wheat pasta, but he still likes his Kraft Mac and Cheese. What can I say? I'm going healthy and its still tasty."
07	76202,B000QB0X7S,A1KU6T3UF5BL5J,12/11/07,3,3,1,Excessive shipping charges,"I purchased this product and the seasoning is very good. I am, however, very dissapointed with their shipping charges. I had sent the seller an email stating that their shipping charge was excessive ($7.50) for such a small item. I received no response. The spice jar (3.5oz) arrived in a small box sent via USPS, and the USPS label on the front showed the cost of $2.38 for shipping. So faerie's finest makes an extra $5.12 on S&H. I suggest they notice that part of Amazon.com's success is due to the fact that they charge straight shipping costs, not inflated S%H. I won't buy from faeire's again."

I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things..."

He absolutely will not eat if something doesn't meet his expectations.  Between that and the recent pet food recalls, I've had a really hard time finding cat food that I can feed him.  I'm happy to say that the Merrick Turducken clicks with him, plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers.  The texture of it is appealing, too . . . it's not just ""mush"" or Spam-looking like many foods.  I'll continue to buy Turducken and plan to also try out some of the other Merrick flavors."

I prepared it as per the instructions and the sauce was runny and quite flavorless.  After one bite my son wouldn't eat any more and after I had a bite too, I couldn't blame him because it was just nasty.  I don't have any problems eating whole wheat pasta and neither does my son, but we couldn't eat this.  I am a firm believer that food can be both healthy and delicious at the same time.  This may be healthy but it is not tasty which means to me that it is not worth eating.  Try the Hodgson Mills whole wheat macaroni and cheese instead.  It is so much better."

My son cannot have eggs either, so we went with the corn starch alternative recommendation on the package and WOW are these great! We have been through PLENTY of store bought Gluten Free cookies and as I'm sure you know --> cardboard anyone? These are not like them AT ALL. We added a little more ""butter alternative"" (since I would normally add more butter to the regular Nestle recipe) and NO ONE could tell the difference (I told my husband they were GF AFTER he inhaled 3 and even he couldn't tell!).

People from work could not believe I made these (well, I did just have to add a few ingredients as the mix is already done for you).  I didn't tell them it was gluten-free because they probably would have not tried it.  I don't need to eat gluten free, but sometimes I do as I think this is a healthier alternative to other ""sweet treats"" out there."

If you like strong tea you likly need to use 2 teabags in a standard size cup (16 oz or so) in order to really enjoy the taste."

07	1555,B000E7WM0K,A1MJSWI87ZME83,4/10/07,1,3,1,Tasteless mess,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.<br /><br />Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.<br /><br />The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess."

I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!"
07	61564,B001EO5R0Y,A2WEQ52C7ZOGQY,3/31/07,2,5,2,Not really an Earl Grey tea,"This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.

The ""Organic Premium"" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better."

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"

It is rich, smooth, and looks like liquid gold in the cup.  The tea leaves can be used 2 or 3 times, depending on how strong you like your tea, with good results and good flavor."
07	61581,B001EO5R0Y,AAVXLDJPBOJBW,1/16/07,6,7,4,About right...,"My experience so far with black organic teas is that they tend to be lighter in flavor that their non-organic counterparts although I can think of no good reason for this. Stash's Organic Ceylon is no exception - it has a good, but subtle flavor.<br /><br />The quality is good: the leaves are small tips and there is very little tea ""dust"" or stems in the bag.<br /><br />I have blended this 1:1 with Stash's Organic Assam for an easy drinking English-style tea."

I think it is excellent though it is not cheap.  The leaves look in excellent shape and only a spoonful is needed in a teapot.  I made the mistake of using too much tea for my first pot but this is a tasty tea."

It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.<br />If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.<br />If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.<br />I highly recommend both."

They are not readily available in local groceries, so when I searched online for them I was happily surprised to find that I could buy them from Amazon!  Now my family takes turns buying the pack of 12 boxes and sharing them."
07	56987,B0007W4VXI,AXFMN82VR0QSD,1/8/07,3,6,3,Decent value,"I was expecting more variety in the flavor, but all the different pods tasted quite similar.  My biggest complaint is that about 1 out of every 5 pods would not produce espresso.  All I got was water, even after trying to run it through the espresso machine a second time.  I'll be sticking with the Espressione brand for my next purchase since the flavor and result is more consistent."
07	61584,B001EO5R0Y,A2R4BNNO98V4A2,12/18/07,3,3,2,This is not premium quality tea,"I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green."

You ""must"" add in the suggested ""extras"" to make the best brownies: 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c chocolate chips or chunks. Sometimes takes longer to bake also, so dont overbake, but worth the time/wait! Those who can eat gluten fight over these brownies with me! :-)"

I can't fault this  jerky, but Amazon's shipping folk for that.  However, the bag had jerky in it that had a strange gray fungus growing on it!<br /><br />I was told this was good jerkey, but I guess I'll never know now.  I may have gotten a very rare moldy pack, but I'll shy away from this stuff."

07	61593,B001EO5R0Y,A35OD1RKGX6RJK,11/18/07,2,2,4,Great Green Tea,"I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead."

They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."

I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****"
07	39169,B000LKX1SW,A106ZCP7RSXMRU,10/1/07,2,2,5,Highest quality organic soy milk + shelf stable + delicious!!,"EdenSoy is a brand that I have come to trust. We try to only eat organic and natural healthy foods, and all of the EdenSoy products are pantry staples in our home. They adhere to the highest standards for both product and manufacturing processes, far exceeding the requirements for organic certification. This is the most delicious soy milk we have tried, and I like that it is enriched with vitamins. Our daughter loves the vanilla. I like all of the flavors. I use it to mix up my protein vitamin shakes - YUM! Another great idea: add frozen banana slices and ice to the soy milk, blend, and you have a terrific healthy breakfast smoothie that the kids (and you) will love! Great to have milk in a shelf-stable package -- just chill when you choose, or pour over ice when you want to enjoy a healthy delicious drink. I used to order cases directly from EdenSoy (at high shipping cost due to weight!) Now I am SO happy that Amazon is carrying this soymilk (and other EdenSoy products) with free super-saver shipping!!"
07	79922,B0000D958O,A12RKPGSZ2TD0N,7/1/07,1,2,1,Not Very Good,The Margarita Mix is excellent!  I've also had the Cranberry Martini Mix which is pretty good.  But this was really disappointing.  The coconut taste is off and it has an aftertaste.  And it feels like something is coating my mouth after I drink it.  I bought a 3-bottle package and will have to toss it.

I went to their web site and found a large assortment of other chocolates and ordered more from there. They shipped quickly (ordered December 3rd, arrived the 7th). The candy was slightly melted (who would expect 80 degree heat on December 7th? Oh, yeah, Fort Worth, Texas). However, my wife loved them!"

07	61609,B001EO5R0Y,A1PVQTIU3JXBZ1,12/22/07,1,1,4,Yummy,"I have tried several incarnations of this tea, both in bags and loose. Numi's loose version is cut bigger, which means less sediment, but I prefer Stash's smaller resealable bags.<br />I really like the sweet taste and often mix honeybush with rooibos."

All sorts of products over the years failed, and in fact, many times I believed the repellents were actually BRINGING the nasty bugs in my direction.  Not so with any kind of Cutter mosquito repellent.  Not only does it take the itch away immediately, and not only do mosquitos avoid you the second you apply some on your skin, but the next day you might wake up to find that the bites you had from the night before have been completely healed.  No kidding.  Great, great product.  Highly recommended."

I've used it on my kids and neither had any kind of (immediate) reaction.<br /><br />I also took this to Liberia for a three week trip. If you've ever been to a place where Malaria is common, you also know how important it is to prevent mosquito bites. I didn't have a single bite, though I have to admit, I didn't see many bugs during these particular three weeks.<br /><br />I've also used it in Washington, DC, where even 25% deet doesn't always seem to work.<br /><br />Combine it's safeness with the fact that it doesn't stink (much), nor stain clothes and this is a no-brainer purchase.<br /><br />I also took a packet of the Cutter Wipes. The packaging is a tad wasteful, which I normally try to avoid, but they also worked well, with no risk of spilling, which is always a concern with sprays."

But the sauce really is quite watery and bland, even with adding the optional butter/margarine.  Alone, cooked per instructions, my kids wouldn't eat this.  I certainly couldn't feed it to kid guests used to traditional mac-n-cheese.  But I discovered that if I mixed in some leftover spaghetti sauce it becomes quite tasty.  I use a jarred sauce added to browned ground beef.  Now that makes a very hearty and tasty meal."

These tarts are lightly iced with white squiggles, so they're not overly sweet like some of the other varieties.  The crust is perfect, and the filling tastes just like a cinnamon roll (hence the name).  Unlike a real cinnamon roll, however, there's no sticky syrup to get all over your hands, so you can easily grab one of these pastries as you head off to work or school.  They are, truly, ""Crazy Good.""<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: Each pastry contains 210 calories; 7 grams of fat; 14 grams of sugar; 34 grams of carbohydrates; 2 grams of protein; and NO cholesterol whatsoever."

It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries, and is maybe a little less spicy."

WRONG. i mixed it as instructed, using milk instead of water as directed to make it lighter. it comes with a small jar of huckleberry jam, that is to be mixed into the batter. it was interesting, so i did it. the batter was thick and lumpy, even after mixing well. the instructions said it would be, if done correctly. when i poured the batter, it kind of ""blopped"" onto the griddle. each pancake took a while to cook, but i was patient. each cake was very HEAVY and cakey. it literally stuck to the roof of my mouth. the lumps exploded into bursts of mix in my mouth. the flavor did taste like huckleberry, but still had a packaged, jammy flavor. i really hated it, as did my husband. his response was, ""what the **** is this mess? i hope you didn't pay much for it!"" unfortnately, it's very expensive, and NOT WORTH IT. i have all the other jam, jelly, and syrup products from ""wild wilderness"", and i have been very pleased at the delicious, fresh flavors. but this one was a dud. you would do better to use your usual mix or recipe, and add some jam to it. don't waste your money on this."

07	61649,B001EO5R0Y,A16KK3YHCWE29C,9/25/07,0,0,3,Bitter aftertaste,"I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!"
07	61650,B001EO5R0Y,A1M5D0DG09UGVM,7/26/07,0,0,4,Big leaves,I haven't had any problems with this tea so I am a notch above indifferent.  I don't regret buying it.
07	44373,B000F6STQG,A3F3B1JPACN215,8/5/07,1,1,3,Too much salmon,"I never thought I'd say this about a spread but there is actually too much salmon and not enough cream cheese.  As packed, it's a bit salty and dry to the point that is crumbles as opposed to being spreadable.  When I opened the second can I mixed it with an equal amount of fresh cream cheese and threw in some capers with excellent results.  I couldn't find anything to do with the tin can so I threw it out.  I bought this on sale at over 60% off of the list price - which is a pretty good value."

The tea comes fairly close to the best on the market -  this is quite an endorsement from an Indian palate who has nearly 30 years of twice daily Darjeeling tea drinking ""experience""."

My previous feed (Pedigree) was mostly corn. My little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat. Also, superior nutrition produces smaller, compact stools."

Albanians refer to it as the ""gypsy curse"".  Some people are grossed out by the spots but I think they are glorious.  Women go crazy when I bring it out at parties.  They love the spongy texture.  I'm glad to see that this comes in a pack of 6.  I was getting tired of telling people to keep their hands of my spotted dick.  Now everyone can enjoy their own."
07	49,B001EO5QW8,ALOR97KTZTK1P,10/6/07,1,2,4,Very good but next time I won't order the Variety Pack,"I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar."

I thought this was the best potting soil and paid more for it only to end up with gnats. Hundreds of them. I wish I had read the previous post before. Do not buy this product. Now it will cost me double to buy another brand and the work of repotting about 40 plants.
07	971,B0002XIB2Y,A2DRQBOGCTC5HP,10/6/07,2,3,5,Best white gravy !,Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother's white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.

The one's that we didn't use it on don't have any. The potting soil has caused gnats to get everywhere in our house. I almost bit into a snadwich today with a gnat right where I was about to take a bite. They've been found in other food, drinks, dive bombing peoples heads and everywhere in between. So, unless you really like gnats, I would suggest another brand and DEFINITELY NOT this one!!!!"

We love these honey flavored bisquits, but will be hard pressed to use all 22 before the expiration date. I ordered them in the middle of March and they have a June expiration date. It would be good if the expiration date was longer or if it was given in the product description."

I wish I had known about them before - their products are always fresh and full of flavor; and their shipping is always, always on time. I do pretty much all of my gift shopping online and a few months ago I started buying this company's 6-packs coolers (they have quite a few different ones to choose from) for birthday and congrats gifts.<br /><br />I've sent this particular 1.75oz Beef Jerky Cooler to 4 different people this summer and each one really enjoyed it. If you're looking to send a gift and you're not certain what kind of jerky the person likes, then this is the one to send. It's a great assortment.<br /><br />On a personal note, their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FZ0TL0"">Buffalo Bills 3.5oz Honey Pepper Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a> and their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYXBPW"">Buffalo Bills 3.5oz Teriyaki Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a> are the 2 best jerkys I have ever eaten. They make 5 different flavors of Country Cut Beef Jerky but these 2 are addictive."

You get more than in the usual ""theater box"" size and enough to share or put away for later! One nice thing about Good & Plenty is that they'll keep a person ""regular"" (LOL!). If you like black licorice you'll love these (if you've never tried them) and the colorful sugar coating adds just enough sweetness to cut the licorice ""bite"". These bags travel well and are easy to ""smuggle"" into the theater! Enjoy!"
07	53349,B000EMM9YY,A3AKXOI1S4Y0RL,8/4/07,2,2,5,These are AWESOME,My family LOVES these and they are sometimes difficult to find.  They are also quick and easy.
07	53350,B000EMM9YY,A23GZG9MO5REQH,6/6/07,2,2,5,Tasty biscuits at a great price,I was buying these regularly at my local market and until recently they stopped carrying the product. My family loves these and they are so fast and easy to make their a perfect addition to any meal. I bought two boxes of 22 packets which per unit came out cheaper than when the market had them on sale. They're a great buy!
07	85681,B0000GIVA0,A1VQSFKF00KOQ3,9/24/07,3,3,5,It taste like the restaruant's drink,"After reading the reviews, I tried it. I love it but, it takes so much concentrate for one cup. It's bit pricy for the amount of cups. However, I would buy it again."

07	85682,B0000GIVA0,A3P6G82HLBXVNF,2/5/07,3,3,5,Finally found it!,I tried Horchata at a Mexican restaurant and loved the drink. I live in an area where Horchata in a restaurant is very hard to come by. So I have tried several Horchata drink mixes in an effort to find a way to make it at home.  This one is the ONLY one that tastes like the kind I had in the restaurant.  I definitely recommend this drink concentrate!
07	64344,B001EO5YAC,A2HBCRDH410E7L,2/6/07,5,9,2,Not best for espresso beverages,The roast is a light medium.  Tried various grinds with my WEGA espresso machine.  Does not have the body and character to make a good espresso beverage.  Look for a darker roast.  Makes a pretty good drip.
07	53352,B000EMM9YY,A195DVGYHOKWOM,9/9/07,1,1,5,Amazing product...Amazing price,This product is definatley true to the name complete...They turn out so melt in your mouth good that they don't even require butter!!!! They are simple to make and fool proof....Plus with the free shipping and no retail markups much cheaper than buying them at the grocery store. The case I got had a good experation date and I have no doubt that we will devoure them long before they expire.
07	85821,B0007SNZQ6,A13NTM92VE1U2Y,7/21/07,1,1,4,Good.,Good. Brings back the old times from the 1970's. The only problem is that the wafers are thinner and slightly harder than what I remember. It isn't the same. But it is as close as I can get. The idea of chocolate drops with the swirl on top in a colorful foil cardboard tube still brings back some nice memories.
07	76036,B001EO6GSG,A36WLPKOEZGYRA,3/10/07,0,0,5,Sophie's Review,My dogs love these treats. They taste good and much healthier for them.

07	51117,B000FIXT2I,A1BAR7JMHWNK6Q,2/10/07,4,5,5,Wonderful Flavor,This rice was quick to fix and the flavor was remarkable. Add to that the fact that the rice is organic only adds to the excellence of the product. LOVED IT!!
07	7532,B00061KXUA,A2T864SXJLBJYM,7/9/07,7,7,5,Best Ginger Preserves Ever,Found these locally in Chicago about 6 months ago.  Amazon's price is high but these are definitely the best I have ever tried.  My wife and I cook with it and just spread it on toast or crackers.  The white jar is also distinctive.
07	38307,B007R1PGVS,A2L0L7P76EAM38,12/10/07,1,1,5,Good Stuff,I have ordered many boxes of the citrus zipp fizz. This is one of the few places I can get the citrus only (I don't like the combo packs) at a reasonable price. I have never had a problem and I find that I enjoy the zipp fizz in the morning just as much as a cup of coffee.
07	4395,B0001217OA,A3F3B1JPACN215,9/20/07,2,2,5,Fantastic,"With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is ""fantastic"".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two -- faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!<br /><br />You can freeze these with no loss of quality.<br /><br />Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold."
07	14722,B000DZKKK2,A2Q6HOOMIJPYQ,5/29/07,0,0,5,Awesome brownies!,These gluten-free brownies match up with Ghiardhelli's Triple Chunk Brownie Mix.  I add chocolate chips to give them a little twist.  My whole family enjoys these.  This is the best gluten-free dessert I've found.
07	14723,B000DZKKK2,A3QRA16OY97F1V,5/5/07,0,0,5,"Wow...the best, most easy desert ever...","I buy this product because I am gluten intolerant and have not found gluten-free ready made deserts that I will eat.  I don't always have time to bake homemade BUT this brownie mix tastes like homemade and it's so moist and yummy!  The rest of my family can eat regular brownies BUT they can't tell that these are gluten free.  The only bad thing about these brownies, is they don't stick around long at my house.  TRY them, you won't be sorry."
07	27719,B000LRFVN8,A2IN3TI47TM3PL,12/30/07,1,1,3,worked well,this is the 1st time i have used the balocco brand. it worked well for the tiramisu although i don't think they tasted as good as the last brand i bought. i would buy this again but i would have to adjust my recipe to help the taste.

These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips."

07	14290,B00012OHZ6,AYHANBLNNN9OF,6/9/07,24,24,5,Great Seaweed !,"Kombu is a wonderful energizer, especially during the summer and in the cold and flu season.<br /><br />Drop one strip into boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, remove and cut into smaller pieces.  Add to 6 cups of water, then add 12 teaspoons of shiro Miso (mild white miso), heat and stir until miso dissolves.  Avoid boiling the ingredients. Add cubed tofu (soft is best), spinach or swiss chard cut into thin strips, shiitake mushrooms cut in thin strips and scallions thinly cut including the green part (reserve half for soup garnish). Heat, but do not boil, for about 10 minutes.  Servie with a splash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.<br /><br />The Kombu has a very mild flavor and best if not overcooked or over softened.  Great for vegans and better than chicken soup!<br /><br />Enjoy !"

The first brand that I tried made much of being ""stone ground"", but the texture when cooked was too coarse for the dish.  These Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Corn Grits were my second purchase, and they have the perfect texture.  They cook quickly and are full of good corn flavor.  Highly recommended."

At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don't have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings."

In my opinion, what they've done is an attempt to make a less costly product ( for them that is} by adding large volume puffed type cereals to the mix. This makes for a lighter product , but with the same size box. The original box weighs 32 ounces, compared to 21 ounces for this new product. Unfortunately, this results in an inferior product, both in taste and nutrition. The real original product is still available in a red box , but I fear they might phase it out if they can get people to go for this cheap imitation."

Chili-Lime is our family favorite, and is often specifically requested by return dinner guests - regardless of what we are serving. It is zesty, with well-balanced spicing and the taste is fresh. All the Geeta brands we have tried - we have tried many - are excellent quality. The condiment matches well with fish, beef, rice, chicken, curry or even on toast. Bon Appetite!"

They make great snacking crackers; and when you serve these to your guests you're gonna be loved by them forever! Hehehe<br /><br />The crackers are very low in fat; and there are no trans fats at all in a serving--hooray! These crackers contain no cholesterol and you do get 5 grams of whole grain in a single serving. Excellent! The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />Moreover, the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.<br /><br />The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests. Of course, you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use.<br /><br />One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale crackers, now would you?<br /><br />Overall, Wheat Thins are some of the best crackers on your grocer's shelf. Buy a box and enjoy some today!"

You will need a mortar and pestle to grind the salt if you use it in recipes, but it is so worth your time.<br /><br />This salt has a distinct salty-from-the-sea flavor that is unique to these salts. The flavor just fills your entire mouth. Normal table salt will pale in comparison and almost has a chemical aftertaste in comparison to this highly prized salt.<br /><br />French chefs have known this secret forever and when I found this salt, I told everyone I knew about the flavor. Sprinkle this salt onto anything you want just before serving, especially good on steaks or freshly cooked vegetables. Also delicious with butter and rosemary on freshly baked bread.<br /><br />Want to taste the best caramels ever? Look for Fleur de Sel Caramels.

However, I tried it again and I've developed a newfound appreciation for what they have here.<br /><br />It is rare to find a true french roast in a consumer branded coffee.  Most of what is called a french roast is really a full city roast (sometimes not even that).  The difference is stark.  However, I blame Starbucks for giving me a taste for a full french roasted bean.  And that is at least partially what you get here.  I'd estimate the blend at about 40% full french roast and the rest ranging from full city to full city roast +.  The net effect is a strong cup of coffee that, yes, will taste a bit scorched if you aren't accustomed to it.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for that same high octane kick that you get from Starbucks coffee then this may be the way to go.  However don't be surprised when you see very darkly roasted beans that are true full french roast.  Also, don't be surprised by a slightly higher caffeine kick!"

I might try something else that is lighter eventually.  It came in the next day by UPS which an expiration of Feb 26 2008. Which means these are good for four months.  I'm very impressed.

I am not a vegan or vegetarian,just a woman on a busy schedule who is trying to overhaul my eating habits.<br /><br />This is a very good product,easy to take to work,school,etc.It is a lot more convenient than cooking brown rice for close to an hour,especially on nights when you are busy and/or cooking for one.I throw some stir-fry seasoned veggies on top,and just eat it from the bowl.Also,with a little brown sugar,pecans and raisins it makes a great alternative to oatmeal in the mornings.Before this,I had tried Uncle Bens quick brown rice pouches that you microwave,which were nasty--salty ,oily and too much fat. All I can say is just try it,you will be pleasantly surprised."

It truly works wonders.,"I have had seasonal asthma ever since I was a child and have tried rather unsuccessfully to overcome it with excercise, inhalers and medication.  NOTHING has worked as well as Yogi's Breathe Deep tea.  It's like a miracle:  When my breathing is feeling restricted, I drink a hot cup of this delicious tea before bed and it sends me into a nice, deep sleep.  When I wake up, my breathing is 100% better and I feel great for the next 1-2 days.  That's no exaggeration.  I reccommend this tea not only for asthmatics, but anyone suffering from stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, or just anyone who appreciates a good tea.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Yogi Tea people!  May your success flourish so I may always keep my cupboard chocked full of your wonderful teas."

It was in essence entirely flavorless.  It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it didn't taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didn't taste like anything.  Looking for a low-cal snack type cracker?  Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers.  Now those are heavenly!"

I loved them, and decided to order a case.  Milk, as of the writing of this review, is still not listed as an ingredient on this website.  There are stickers over the ingredients, which include milk powder.  I called the company and was told the recipe had changed.  They were very nice and offered a refund.

This one is very good, as is Jarrows, don't bother with the NOW brand. This does not have that gag factor that some of the oils do. I couldn't really tell the difference between this and the Jarrows, they were both very good oils."

So far, the coffee's ok and not stale, but just something to keep in mind."
07	41879,B000GB0THM,A1CB7TWXNEWBPJ,12/22/07,0,0,2,Disappointing,The rooibos is fine but the Early Grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed. Tastes more like a perfumed tea than a balanced blend emulating the classic black tea version. I've had very fine rooibos versions of Early Grey so I know it can be done.
07	81642,B000KSVLG4,A1GTTVP6ZW7T6X,10/15/07,6,7,5,Wonderful Coffee,"I bought two bags of the Altura whole bean coffee off an Amazon special.

In the book and movie, Edmond is temped by the White Witch with this traditional dessert.  It was fun sharing it with the guests.  Most people had never tried it (us included)!  My son enjoyed it the most.  It is an acquired taste.  I think the guests liked being able to try something completely different.  My son has asked for more (not unlike Edmond!!!)"

Most of the grounds ended up in the bottom of my cup and the rest spewed all over my coffeemaker!  I notified Gevalia over a month ago and they have not offered any explanation or solution to this problem.  I have not had this problem with any other brand of T-disc or other Gevalia blends.  It is extremely frustrating considering I am paying extra for the Gevalia name. I would recommend Maxwell House or Seattle's Best being far superior in the T-Discs with no grounds in the bottom of your cup."

No, this cup has good flavor, and is a nice mello brew, great for a mid morning or early afternoon pick-me-up if you are not participating in a decathalon event. If that is what you are looking for, the Tassimo concept is probably not for you. The Seattles Best is a stronger Brew. Give that a shot if you want something different with a little more kick."

They roast the nuts there in the shop. The cashews just melt in your mouth they are so fresh. The mixes they offer are awesome. I personally love the cranberry nut mix. I was surprised and delighted to see they can be purchased here on Amazon! You won't be disappointed! Enjoy!

I e-mailed the company to see if they could reship a new basket before Christmas which was now about a week away. When the new basket arrived it was about 1/4 the size of the first and had very little selection. Needless to say I will not recomend this company or buy from them ever again."
07	46658,B001E530IE,A8UVXKICZL6SY,6/15/07,2,2,5,Good coffee at a reasonable price,"I like a rich dark roast coffee without bitterness. Before discovering Yuban Dark Roast, I was ordering expensive coffee from Gevalia and Peets, as I was unable to find coffee to my liking locally, even in our natural foods coop.  I tried Yuban Dark Roast on a whim when I noticed it on the supermarket shelf.  Even my husband commented on how good this coffee is.  I was glad to find the larger cans on Amazon, as purchasing this way makes it even more economical."

I've ordered this dish at many Irish Pub/Restaurants in NYC and find this mix comparable in taste. The Knorr ""Mealmaker"" seasoning packet, one pound of ground beef, 6-7 mashed potatoes and sauteed onions are all you need to create Shepherd's Pie that compares to restaurant fare. I add a small can of peas & carrots and an extra ""shot"" of ketchup to the mix from time to time; it works well for us!"
07	54382,B0009JRKDC,A291P9NIT3QF4Y,12/12/07,2,2,5,Better than Expected!!!,"This exact brand is in my very expensive neighborhood health store--12 oz. cost 19.99. So, I'm getting a great deal here and the taste is better than butter.  I've used it in everything from oatmeal to sauteeing veggies.  I will say that in the jar there is a very, very subtle coconut smell, but when combined with food there is none at all.  In fact, my other oil is ghee--and as good as that is, I prefer the coconut oil.  My husband who is funny about most things loves it too--he was especially crazy about the idea that he could have an oil that wouldn't raise his cholesterol and that actually aids your body rather than destroy it like most oils.  I purchased this particular brand less than a month ago, and we love it so much that I've ordered another shipment with double the order."
07	50425,B000FKIYEO,A2N0K1XBW4Y8A3,3/9/07,0,1,5,Altoids,"The product is exactly what I wanted.  The spearment flavor is hard to find in retail locations.  I also like to shop bulk to avoid regular trips to the store.  I have Altoids on my desk at work and enjoy people coming by to get some.  Instead of candy, I have Altoids, which everyone can benefit from, from time to time."
07	3079,B000FDKQCO,A20M76MB4JG4XF,3/5/07,1,1,3,Grainy Brownies,"I like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy.  It is also very oily even after you cook it.  If you do not mind gritty brownies then get this product.  Also, they are not very chocolately so I added chocolate chips to the recepie.  It makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way."

Now that I found this brownie mix I make a patch, freeze them in individual servings, and have one brownie a day. The recipe is easy and the brownies are rich and flavorable. They're a chocolate lovers answer to having a yummy snack and staying gluten free.  I love them."
07	50421,B000FKIYEO,A1OB4YRIVPF6HB,5/19/07,0,0,5,Altoid flavors I can't find in local stores,"I was slightly worried when ordering because all the pictures shown of the ""pack of 12 tins"" were actually pictures of a pack of 6 tins.  But I trusted the words over the pictures and did receive packs of 12 tins (double what the photo shows).<br /><br />I bought packs of 12 tins in four different flavors, because I've found Altoids taste better when they are a different flavor than whatever flavor Altoid I had last.  Local stores have only the peppermint, which I like least.  The Spearmint and Wintergreen are surprisingly different from each other and from peppermint.  Spearmint is my favorite, closely followed by Cinnamon.  I like the Liquorish primarily for being so different from other flavors.<br /><br />Buying in bulk just saved a few cents vs. a local store price.  I bought in bulk because the multiple flavors are available and the packaging keeps it fresh a lot longer than it takes for me to finish them."
07	50420,B000FKIYEO,AK0EG5KSXTIQX,8/4/07,0,0,5,Altoid Mints,"The local stores no longer stock the Spearmint flavor of the Altoids mints, so when I noticed the website on the tin can, I contacted the site and was directed to Amazon com., which led me to a resource for ordering a dozen cans. The package was sent promptly. I am a very satisfied customer."

07	14755,B0002XIAXE,APT293UJH8WZY,12/30/07,17,22,3,Tastes Good But No Safety Seal,"In fairness to the product itself, I did taste it and it does taste good. However, I couldn't get over the fact that there was no safety seal or tamper evident seal. I know I'm probably too paranoid, but in this day and age I like to see some type of safety seal on products I'm going to consume. I think that there should at least be a button that pops up when you open the bottle. But that's just me. The order came in 6 bottles. I didn't return them, because the next buyer would have absolutely no evidence that I opened one of the bottles. So it's a loss to me. Oh well, I guess it's one of the risks of ordering from the internet, not being able to inspect the packaging before purchase."
07	15699,B001EO5WF4,A2C7RZWVRR7VNW,7/2/07,1,1,5,Great coffee!,This coffee was removed from the shelves in the local stores.  It's a great smooth tasting coffee.  Love it!

By now, I am very concerning what food should be included in our diets to maintain good health. Especially, high calories food based on carb make me worried about my diet. BUT! Since I tried this product, which is real good, I stop worrying to eat RICE. It's real low calories, healthy organic brown rice, not expensive, and easy to cook (just only 1min. 30sec. in the micro.). Anyway, I really enjoy this product, and of course buy again."
07	54383,B0009JRKDC,A1DV2YLTZJA82W,7/23/07,2,2,4,Great product,"Coconut oil has helped to lower my cholesterol dramatically in only a few months, along with other dietary changes. The only problem with this product is that it is packaged in plastic rather than glass, so I might not buy it again from this company. The supplier/shipper also poorly wrapped the jar for shipping."

I couldn't find the same brand but this ""Xtreme"" catnip sounded like it might do the trick.  Not even close.  My husband swears he saw our cat lift up his paw and yawn after smelling it.  If your cat is like mine you'll probably get a better reaction out of any other catnip out there."

07	40443,B000FFS0CA,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,5/5/07,3,7,3,$43.20 for 48 buds but only one bud is tasty and nice to look at,"I suggest ordering the pack with the small glass teapot with one each of 9 different flowering teas first.  Two disk and two balls are packed in each small box.  The ball ones open up in a cuter way.  They should steep longer to get the best flavor out of them but by that time, the tea will have cooled  considerably.  Of the four types, I only liked the taste of the ball with the red blossom.  None of them bloomed as prettily as other brands I have tried."
07	2594,B000EGX2EG,A2T0LGPLQY2GW,6/13/07,0,1,5,Great Almond Crunch!!,My husband and both love almonds. I've even shared this snack with co-workers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack.  I'm taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip.

07	40442,B000FFS0CA,A1M5D0DG09UGVM,7/26/07,1,2,2,Not Pretty,I was very excited to receive this tea but was disappointed by the blossoms.  Don't buy this large size if you have never tried this brand.
07	56982,B0007W4VXI,A18EEVR9KO5W8K,7/19/07,3,5,3,Nice collection except for one lemon,"It was going great (really great) until we hit the first Hausbrandt pod. Watery, light and tasteless. All the Hausbrandt pods are the same. I wish PodMerchant would take this out of the collection.<br /><br />The rest of the collection is fantastic. If you are looking to sample a variety of coffee flavors before deciding to mass order the ones you like, this sampler collection is ideal. We have no favorite brands, just what suits us best for the occasion. In general, the darker wrappers seem to be the richer, heavier flavors and the lighter wrappers were lighter. That said, there are many exceptions to the rule. We liked to be surprised.<br /><br />Highly recommend this collection, but only if PodMerchant will be kind enough to remove the HausBrandts. Atleast 10 pods were of this brand."

Numi makes very good teas, great selction and the pricing is not over the top. Shipping with Amazon makes it quite competitive."

07	57431,B001EO5RW2,A31G4XZ8KYYH5J,1/8/07,4,4,5,Delicious for celiacs,This is a great cereal and particularly for people with celiac.  The same package on the store shelf is about twice what I can get it for at Amazon and it comes right to your door and there is no shipping.

While I haven't seen the item, I've been told it's a very nice basket. Ghirardelli chocolate is just fine, and there seemed to be enough of it in the package."
07	18733,B000FFRU3U,A73GE1TR8W1PL,5/18/07,2,2,4,Barley and Oats,A perfect quick breakfast meal you can keep in your desk or pack in a bag on a trip. I loved the combination of oats and barley and it was the perfect amount of sweetness.
07	56980,B0007W4VXI,A1ALI3X9E7SBUA,6/13/07,0,0,5,Ex-spresso!,"Great assortment of PODs delivered in a giant, resealable bag.  Highly recommended.  Pods were all individually wrapped and very fresh.  Great aromas upon opening some of the pod envelopes, too! The graphics on the individual pod envelopes are pretty interesting; definitely adds to the fun of trying all these new coffees. Each time I made an espresso I marked the empty POD envelopes A, B or C to remember which ones I liked best.  I recently got a Francis X1 and this sampler pack has helped me enjoy my new espresso machine."

That is why we are so thankful to have found Mrs. May's products!!  They are all very healthy and quite tasty, and ordering them from Amazon keeps the cost down.  My son's a golfer, and I am always looking for portable, healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag.  Mrs. May's products fit the bill nicely."

I already have a stack of boxes in the garage so I won't run out. And here I am stockpiling more (in case of nuclear holocaust).<br /><br />Almonds have always been my staff of life -- raw, roasted, dry roasted, blanched, flavored, and of course Mrs Mays. I rarely have a day without them. I even feed them to the parrot. A bird guy told me they were the healthiest. And the bird goes nuts for Mrs. Mays.<br /><br />These are, dare I say, miracle nuts. One taste and I was hooked. How she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle. If you're tired of tastless, bland, gotta-eat-it-because-its-healthy snacks from the nutrition store, try these for a pleasant awakening.<br /><br />Mike"

Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really."

Instead, I got them at the commissary where they are roughly half the price.<br />The product could not be easier to make. Peel back the plastic cover on one corner, microwave for 2 minutes, and you have hot ready to eat rice!<br />There are stove top directions as well.<br />In the microwave, the rice turned out perfectly. It's not overcooked, or a mushy mess. Perfect slightly sticky rice.<br />I'll definitely buy this again. However, it is somewhat expensive, considering you could buy an entire bag of dry rice for this price, and it would feed you many times over what these do."

07	38851,B000ICO8GW,A2GSS1J87AZGEA,10/25/07,1,1,5,Delicious!,"I became a Tassimo fan about six months ago. I have tried all the different brews they offer including their imported Nabob and Kenco blends, all of which I truly enjoy. However, the Gevalia Signature blend is just perfect for the morning. It is smooth, fragrant, not too rich, and easy to drink more than one cup! This is the t-disc I reach for most frequently."

07	10038,B000F4D4HW,A1Y1ODQM9H4EYC,1/8/07,1,1,4,Good Product,This is a very good value.  I use it to put in many Asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth.  The result is a more authentic Asian taste to my recipes.
07	73284,B0012XBCZQ,A3TRPX727O4YGB,9/30/07,4,4,5,Best tasting chips ever!!,I love these chips; they are my favorite to dip in French onion dip. They are the best!! They are so much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than at my local grocery store. I highly recommend ordering these chips!!

So if you like this taste, good luck.  Let me know if you find another one; until then I will buy these from Amazon.  Thanks, guys.  :)<br /><br />They remind me a lot of a cookie that was around when I was a kid in the late 60s - early 70s.  They were square and they were called Orbits."

I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!<br /><br />I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!<br /><br />I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!"

The vegetable broth has a rich, exotic flavor. I used it to cook asparagus and had rave reviews around the table. Now, I use it as often as possible to put new life into familiar foods.  I am very happy with every aspect of the product - the unique flavor, elegant packaging, convenient single-serve stick pouches, and the value for the money. The product packs nicely for camping and backpacking as well. Glad I found this hidden gem!"

It was also good as burrito filling with some extra cheese. This is a good starting point to let your imagination make good great. The expiration date on mine was good for a year, well into 2008."

This company also makes other flavors that are just as good.  And it's not just the flavors that makes this brand stand out.  It's the way they're cooked and the actual flavor of the potato that you'll love!"

Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid ""bite.""  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!  If you like exotic flavors, this isn't it.  But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one."

They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips."

I can go to the most expensive gourmet food purveyor in Los Angeles and get better quality salt from Il de Re for far less money. Also, there are far better quality Il de Re versions of this salt. It is not white and flaky as it should be but grey with large crystals.  Poor quality, slow to send, expensive. Never again"

He is the cook/chef of the family and was skeptical until he tasted them. They are the richest, most flavorful broths we have ever used; when reconstituted as directed, they keep a full deep color and since they are concentrates, can be diluted as little or as much as needed. The little packages are so convenient as well, taking much less space than the typical cans. We're never going back to the ""regular"" broths."

Yorkshire Gold tea has more flavor and character than most teas.<br /><br />The secret seems to be in the high quality of the teas selected for Yorkshire Gold and in the shape of the tea bag which allows for the tea leaves to spread out more and I think this enhances the ability for a full tea flavor to develop.<br /><br />This tea blend is perfect to steep along with a cinnamon stick.

How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some ""loose"" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh."

07	16180,B0001BVD04,A1SYLII0808HD6,6/13/07,3,3,4,41/2*  Working Guy's Cherry Soda,"""Boylan Bottleworks""<br /><br />AS a charter member of ""Free Associators Anonymous,"" the company name is ripe with conotation: Pittsburgh. Giant pipes of metal and glass with sweaty workers downing a ""Boylans"" (or, shorter, sweeter: ""Hey, Trow Me a 'Boys'!""  Ironworks, manholes made in Oakland, tough immigrants, and cherries blacker than coal. Coupled with The Bottle Americana, even a non-serious soda flavor like cherry has a certain gravitas, a don't-screw-with-me style, even though I'm rich enough to afford this.<br /><br />Speaking of serious, let's get on with the parlor game of tasting notes. Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.  It keeps Boylan's from perfection, just as the Amazon price may give you pause.  (Trader Joe's does it again--will this company ever do an IPO so that we can all get rich off its well-deserved popularity.<br /><br />Back to Boylan again.  It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman. You deserve this liquid luxury presented with no-nonsense attitude."

He is a constant busy-body and this toy provides hours of entertianment for him. My concern was the durability becasue he can chew through most everything immediately.... not this toy! It is by far the most durable!!! He did eventually chew through the rope, which I removed and he continues to play with this and carry it around most of the day. Our other little Springer Spaniel loved it so much that after months of fighting over it, I bought Wrigley one for his 1st birthday last month. I was so pleased with the first one, I also purchased the Preimer Waggle for him. If it is possible, this toy is even more entertaining than the other! Hard to believe ... these toys have kept our puppies busy, entertained and constantly concentrating and working on getting the treats out! I love them!"

Some vegetarian jerkies are so horrid, it is surprising they made it to market.<br /><br />Even in their tiny packages, a lot of vegetarian jerkies are so bad I can't finish them.<br /><br />But there are a lot of varieties of this brand that we like:  teriyaki, hickory, and thai peanut are our favorites.  This is seitan, which is a chewy gluten product.  It is stringy in texture, moist, and is a good match for the flavors.  There are some flavors I don't particularly like, such as the lime flavor, but even the ones I don't like seem like someone else would. (As in, I don't like barbecue potato chips, but I can see where someone else would.)"

Even chewing is too much work for me.  Given that, Primal Strips are heaven.  The texture is very close to meat, but is consistently chewable, with none of the gristle often associated with beef jerky.  Spam is too gooey.  Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently.  But this?  This is perfect.  If ""they"" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown-type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind.  I'm not sure of the health benefits.  I guess it's good for me.  I've seen people who are healthier than I eating it, so I figure it's nutritious.  Anyway, it tastes robust, has a perfect texture, and is a perfect snack."

The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product.

Instead of having to use a piller to force a pill down their throat, they think they are getting a treat.  It works very well.  After having to use a piller on my cat for about a month, I woke up in the middle of the night after having a dream about a treat that could hold the pill in it.

Squeeze or pinch the top of the pocket over and the pill is concealed from a pet in a treat. In fact, the treat is so soft and supple, you don't even have to put the pill in the pocket. You can just push the treat onto the pill and squeeze the rest of the treat material around the pill to hide it. Works well when hiding multiple pills that might not fit in the pocket. I buy the cat size for my small dog (4.5 lb), and she just loves them. Never has refused a pill hidden in one. I even use them empty as a treat!"

She will play with it until every last bit of kibble is liberated.  After many hours of play, the jug is a bit scratched, but the rope remains intact.  My dogs do not chew the rope (or I would remove this toy and replace with something more appropriate). They seem to recognize that the rope is helpful in removing kibble from the jug.  Tug-a-Jug is definitely a hit!  It keeps my very busy puppy occupied for 45-60 minutes per refill."

These are the only cookies of this type he will eat. I don't know much about the other flavors but this flavor of cookie is tops.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that Amazon will not package them correctly.

Very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is Mrs. May's Almond Crunch. From the first time I tasted it, to every time I eat it now, I am amazed at the crunchiness, quality of the almonds, lightly-sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle-like, attention to healthiness in the ingredients, etc. As a side note, because of how much I was impressed by this product, I went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of Mrs. May's products, from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches, etc. Perhaps I'm biased to the original, but none of the others have that same magic. I would rate the rest as 4 stars. But the almond crunch should get 6 stars."

Even so I was delighted to see Little Bear Shells on Amazon. Unfortunately, there was a severe communication issue. My shells arrived -- 1 box of 12 shells. I called customer service and tried to explain that more than $20 for one box of taco shells was crazy and that clearly there were supposed to be 12 boxes of 12 shells each or 144 shells in my order. The rep did not understand. She was confused by my complaint, after all the site said 12 and I had received 12. We agreed to disagree. To her credit, she was very kind about refunding the money.

07	67465,B0000DIPJC,A2M4U5L2AW8PKF,9/11/07,3,3,4,Relatively Better Hachez Bar,"As is, Cocoa D'Arriba consists of the best and natural ingredients only; no emulsifier, no artificial Vanillin. Concerning the high ingredient quality and business ethics, these are huge pluses. However, as most reviewers have complained, there is barely any chocolate taste, let alone the fact that it is not rich or fulfilling for that matter. This is most likely due to the fact that Cocoa D'Arriba is ultra-refined (14 microns) to generate a smooth and mellow taste. That is, the chocolate is over-refined, thus very little has remained from the original rich chocolate taste. You can run into the same problem in olive oil industry, where sometimes the oil is ultra-refined during pressing, which brings about the lack of actual olive taste and thus character. Too sad.<br /><br />Hachez Orange Bar 77% Cocoa is certainly a more successful product in the series, however. The natural orange-oil in it brings about a very mellow yet significant and pleasing orange flavor to this dark chocolate bar. It definitely adds  much flavor and gives some character to this over-refined chocolate bar."

In fact, if the acid in the vinaigrette is a good sherry vinegar, the flavor of the lemon in the oil is more noticeable than the vinegar."

The taste dissipates in no time, and the gum itself is far from elastic.<br /><br />Yet I still buy it.  Why?  Because it uses only XYLITOL as its sweetener, a substance that actually reverses tooth decay (minor reversal, mind you, but, well... I'll take anything).  It's actually GOOD for teeth.<br /><br />Other gums on the market that taste better have XYLITOL as an ingredient, but they also include other sugar-free sweeteners.<br /><br />Here's what Wikiipedia says about XYLITOL:  ""Xylitol is a 'toothfriendly' sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries. Recent research[7] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then ""starves"" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption.""<br /><br />On top of all this, XYLITOL might actually improve bone density.<br /><br />Taste?

They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips."

07	32093,B0009F3SAK,A1H8LWWA8A9757,2/28/07,4,4,4,A Welcome Change,"I wasn't sure about this tea at first because I had tried several other teas that contained licorice that were just too sweet for me. However, I'm pleasantly surprized by the light, tangy flavor of this tea. The sweetness is there, but it's not overwhelming. I'm not certain that it's done much for me in relation to ""detox,"" but I certainly like the taste, especially after lunch. It seems to settle my stomach and help me digest."

I had recently purchased a ""Garden Chile Pepper"" blend paste from the refrigerated produce section and was pleased with the product, so I was not hesitant to buy another product from a tube.<br /><br />What a mistake.  I believe that the manufacturer made this pesto with dried basil.  It tased like dust and looked like it too.  I thought at least I could make some pesto butter to freeze if it wasn't good enough for sauces, but I ended up pitching the whole thing.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, here.  There's just no substitute for the taste of the real -fresh- thing!"

It adds *a lot* of sweetness, making this two-jar set a great value.<br /><br />It does take a little mixing to dissolve in beverages, though -- keep that in mind if you're filling a cup up. I've had better success adding the stevia while the cup (or jar, when I make iced tea) is still only half-full, then mixing it in with a fork, then topping off my drink.<br /><br />This is a plant extract, not an instantly-dissolving chemical product, so don't be surprised the first time.<br /><br />It is fantastic and delicious, though!"

As someone who suffers from dairy sensitivity, I was enthused to find a GOOD VEGAN pesto product! This is coming from someone who is an authentic Italian who grew up on homemade goods. Maybe the previous users who disliked it weren't using good, quality olive oil? Just a thought. It makes the sauce. It's SO MUCH better than cheese-laden commercial crap..."

THey were just glorified Smarties as far as I was concerned. Then someone at M&M's had a stroke of genius: add peanuts to them! At that moment something special was born: the world's most delicious and heavenly choking hazard.<br /><br />Being a bit bigger than your average M&M, they take a bit more effort to swallow whole, so that is not a reccommended approach when eating them. I have given up trying to wolf them down for that reason.<br /><br />You would think peanuts and chocolate would be a over-done idea. Probably right. But there is something about these coloured little ovals of pleasure. I can easily knock off a whole bag on my own, (that's right: I do not share!). Just give me a few minutes alone with it.<br /><br />For snack, (or a balanced meal in it's own right), Peanut M&M's are about the best there is."

I've never used it on pasta because I don't care for pasta.  But I use it as a seasoning. It's less heavy than the pestos that come in jars (that often have cheese already in them---thus not the high quality cheese I'd prefer). If I want this pesto spiked up with parmesan, I'll use a very good cheese--and it then makes a very good pesto!"
07	631,B000G6RYNE,A1IVFBJA9KAI1M,10/2/07,2,3,4,Tasty!,"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!"

In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious."

It makes a great sauce on on dried pastas alone (or with a little cheese for the gourmet). And it really gives a lot of flavor to bland freeze-dried meals. Well worth its weight. I liked it so much that I even use it at home, now thats good camping food!"

Since starting him on a dairy-free diet last summer, I was hard-pressed to find an alternative for cheese-laden pesto sauce, since I can't easily make my own. Since I found this paste my problems are solved-- he loves it and eats it almost every day."

I was a little disappointed because I thought there was probably too much sugar in the jam, and the sugar drowned out the flavor of the mulberries. If I were making this, I would try to use a little bit less sugar than before."

Recently, many brands of health bars have come out with chunks of fruits and nuts glued together with a sticky sweetener, such as aguave syrup, honey or evaporated cane juice. KIND Bars are not exceptional among these bars, and all of these types of snacks are very good in my experience.<br /><br />What makes KIND Bars different is that a portion of the profits is directed to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is a charity that supports peace in the Middle East. By ""peace in the Middle East,"" they mean support for the ""Palestinian Resistance"" againgst the Israeli ""occupation."" This charity is considered centrist, and it rejects extremism, which it finds to be ineffective.<br /><br />Executive Manager of the PeaceWorks Foundation, Fathi Mohamed Hamdan Darwish, had this to say about the strategy of driving Israel into the Sea: ""That solution is unrealistic and ineffective and can't be realized. We as a Palestinian people have historically paid the price of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and injured people and haven't reached this solution."""

The trainer recommended these treats for training because they're small and the dog doesn't have to stop and chew and chew between activities.  Also, these chicken and salmon treats seem to have healthier ingredients than most other dog treats.  Truthfully, I am not an expert on what's good or bad for dogs nutritionally, but I'm sitting here looking at two dog treat bags.  One has dried whey, palm kernel oil, sugar, dicalcium phosphate, maltodextrin, defatted peanut flour, salt, soy lecithin and caramel.  Basically sounds like candy.  Mini naturals have chicken, ground barley, ground rice, lots of vitamins...no detectable sugars.  Maybe dogs don't need the grains, but the protein-based, no-sugar recipe seems like a better choice.  Try a bag and if you don't like them, you can return the unused portion to the company for a full refund."

We split the box I bought here, and it was less expensive ($2.21/box of 20) than when we get it by the single box in the grocery store ($2.59/box).  Definitely worth it, especially if you can get the free shipping!  Who needs coffee??!?"

I have in the past had a difficult time finding it in any of the grocercy stores I shop at, and when I do the price is at least a dollar a box more than here.<br /><br />If you like a flavorful tea, you should like this one.  In my hom you can't go wrong with this one."

07	66128,B0007A0AQW,AT29RT9XL3RN1,5/9/07,0,0,5,Great for Training!,"This is one of the few brands that have treats appropriately small enough for my Chiuaua-mix. But, having been the owner of a large dog, these would also be great for training large dogs.  Dogs don't really have a sense of size- they're as happy with a small bite as a much larger treat! And you don't want you're dog to be too busy chewing when you want to keep his/her attention and repeat a behavior.  These treats are just the right size!"

Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!"
07	66129,B0007A0AQW,A260MMTB3NJXVQ,3/26/07,0,0,5,Best dog treat ever,"Finding these treats was a complete fluke. When on vacation in Hollywood, FL we stopped in a gourmet pet store. There was a cute yorkie that we were petting and we told the owner we had Chihuahuas. He was buying Zukes and absolutely raved about the treats. He recommended the chicken but we purchased the peanut butter treat. We keep the treats in the fridge. My dogs LOVE these treats. If we open the fridge they are right there. The size is perfect for training. I can't say enough great things about the product, healthy and it makes my dogs happy."

While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6"">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"

Pepperoni they are not.  If you are expecting seriously spicy and rich pepperoni you will be let down as I was.  Does that make these treats bad?  No, I still found them to be good in their own right.  They're like Slim Jim's that actually taste like you're eating meat as opposed to extruded grease logs.  They're pretty good and I may buy them again but be warned that it's just not quite pepperoni.<br /><br />On a side note, I received a sample of their 3 day cold smoked ""Old Smokies"" and those things are God in meat form, I highly recommend those."

The instructions to turn this mix into chili or dip are clear and concise, and include suggestions for ""doctoring"" it up. Following the directions to the letter will result in a meatless (but not vegetarian - read the ingredient list) chili that is flavorful but not too spicy. I especially love the variety of beans included. My suggestion for perfect chili: add a half pound of spicy turkey sausage (mild is too sweet) and a half pound of lean ground beef. Brown the meat first then add water as indicated on the package (don't increase or decrease the water measure) and follow the directions from there. Yum!"

I was very pleased to find it here in bulk - Trader Joe's seems to have ceased selling it. Apparently it was ""too spicy"" (this is what I found out from a friend's husband who works at one of the TJ's warehouses). To me, it's a perfect blend of heady spices, and it's not too overwhelming."

I can cook a whole jar (about 5-5.5 cups) in my rice cooker, with good results.  If Amazon ever starts stocking the 32-oz bags from Lundberg's, though, I'd switch."

As the only celiac in the crowd, I decided to wait until the others had tried it, before revealing that it was gluten free.  Everyone raved over the great taste!  The package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake, which is how I served it.  My own two boys said it was the best cake I had ever made, including the traditional wheat flour cakes I sometimes make for the rest of my family.  It was moist, spicy, and rich.  It reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when I was growing up, and she was a terrific cook.  I highly recommend this one!"

Concerning the high quality ingredients and business ethics, these are big pluses. However, as most reviewers have complained, there is barely any taste, let alone the fact that it is not rich or fulfilling for that matter. This is most likely due to the fact that Cocoa D'Arriba is ultra-refined (14 microns) to generate a smooth and mellow taste. That is, the chocolate is over-refined, thus very little has remained from the original rich chocolate taste. You can run into the same problem in olive oil industry, where sometimes the oil is ultra-refined during pressing, which brings about the lack of actual olive taste and thus character. Too sad.<br /><br />I recommend Hachez Orange Bar 77% Cocoa instead, which is certainly a more successful product in the series. The natural orange-oil in it brings about a very mellow yet significant and pleasing orange flavor to this dark chocolate bar. It definitely adds  much flavor and gives some character to this over-refined chocolate bar. It has more taste and after taste."

There is no seasoning added.  When I used this rice instead of ordinary white rice, my husband commented on how delicious it was compared to the usual.  Texmati brown rice added a delicate perfume to the dish which complemented perfectly the mild flavors of the other ingredients."

It was just 4 glass bottles thrown into a box and shipped. Also there were no markings on the box to say it was fragile or that there was glass inside.  When I tried to go online and return it I was told the items were not returnable.  So I just bought some expensive, broken, oil.

The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)"

EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR in that box tastes exactly like what it should. A little pamphlet comes inside the Jelly Belly box, which tells you what different jelly beans you can mix to create a certain food. For example, 2 peanut butter jelly beans + 1 jam jelly bean = peanut butter jelly sandwich. It has a lot of fun combinations and surprisingly, they all taste like the foods that they should!<br /><br />This is really a great gift. Everyone I've given it to can't stop talking about how real these flavors taste, and the kids have lots of fun looking at the pamphlet and mixing the jelly beans to create foods!"

The ravioli could have had meat (as advertised) cheese or even spinach inside... it's really hard to tell.  The pasta is soft and gooey.  My kids are begging for more.

We eventually tried it, and fell in love with the taste, texture and ease of preparation.  You coat the salmon in a bit of the rub, and saute it in a little olive oil.  The resulting crust adds a mildly spicy, sweet flavor and a very slight crust to the salmon that my wife and I like better than any other way we've tried salmon.

These are not greasy by any means and you can keep them in your pocket or a treat bag quite easily.<br /><br />They are solid treats that aren't brittle so there's no real fear of them falling apart in your pocket or treat bag.  They aren't totally solid, but their baked quality gives them a harder consistency that provides a great crunch for dogs.  The closes thing I can compare them to are small croutons, (these are slightly smaller) like you'd put on a salad for instance.<br /><br />I make sure I've got a good supply of them around the house.  For the money, that hasn't been a problem.  And with the wholesome ingredients they contain, you don't feel guilty about giving out a few extras ;)"

They seem to focus on scratching at the purple spiked piece and don't do much flailing around by the rope, so that could be why.<br /><br />One of the dogs figured out how to use it right away, although it took her a couple of weeks to get a little more aggressive with it.  It took the other one almost a month to not be afraid of it!  It never fails, though, when they go for their toy box, this is the toy they pull out and play with for a good 20 minutes.

07	32242,B0009F3SAU,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,1/13/07,6,8,5,"Great Immune Booster, Yummy and Unusual Tasting Tea","*****<br /><br />This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement.""<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, ""When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day.""<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that this review is for the six-pack of 16-count boxes, an excellent value overall. Compare it to other six-packs of this same tea on Amazon to make sure it's the best value, though, as they are always cheaper than buying the single boxes, but some are better deals than others.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.<br />Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.<br />Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high."

This is the only substitute sugar my husband has not detected. We have had it in our sugar bowl for five months and he still thinks it is sugar!
07	22065,B000KV61FC,ALIL6GECW4VE1,10/2/07,6,7,2,Good idea... my dogs are not interested.,"I don't know.  Maybe I'm just not putting the right ""yummy goodness"" inside.  This toy, though durable and a novel idea, doesn't hold either of my dogs' interest.  Not even our beagle (who tells everyone she's STARVING and we NEVER feed her... EVER!) seems to be interested in this for any length of time."
07	28640,B000FKAYO2,A1AQ2W2R4SOVGN,11/19/07,2,9,1,Disappointed,"I find the texture of this, and most other brown rice pastas, to be really off-putting. There are much better alternative-grain pastas available, like quinoa."

I loved ginger snaps and molasses cookies before I was diagnosed with celiac and this are a lovely indulgence in a sparce market. I dip them in milk, my daughter eats them plain. Good texture too!"
07	42712,B000OK2AG8,A1QK7RD0B0MVHY,7/23/07,6,6,5,The Best Green Tea,I've tried many brands of green tea and this is by far the best.  The only thing better was a loose tea I bought in Japan.  Remember to let the water cool a little before adding the bag.  And I would suggest checking your local Asian market for a lower price.  I usually pay $19.00 for a pack of 100 bags.
07	46810,B000LQOCS4,A2WP03S83B4EHV,7/27/07,1,1,5,Convenient Quality,"I love this product!  You can keep a can in your cupboards and then whenever you want hummus, instead of running to the store, you just add lemon juice, olive oil and garlic.  It tastes fresh and good!<br /><br />Plus this avoids the barely used jar of tahini languishing in my fridge... it's already IN there!<br /><br />Cheers to Cortas, another good product!"
07	62275,B000CQG8KS,A1PEO50732652O,3/18/07,0,0,5,Excellent!,I have always enjoyed Earl Grey tea because of the flavor of Bergamot.  I was pleased to find that there is this version of Earl Grey with Double Bergamot which only enhances the flavor!  I love this tea and believe anyone who enjoys Earl Grey will love this as well.
07	40266,B000I5GWEK,A34GQ4YKJVIFT9,5/23/07,2,3,3,Licorice bites,Tastes like regular licorice.  Packages are small and have to buy 12 so not the best value.  Would like to see larger packages.  It is good licorice.
07	62276,B000CQG8KS,A1QR88UTOZVJZL,1/9/07,0,0,5,Chi tea,The tea is delicious and I got quite a lot of tea for a fraction of the cost of what I pay regularly.  Keep up the good work..offering great deals!
07	40264,B000I5GWEK,AVVUFYV3AMO6Y,12/2/07,4,4,5,I haven't had licorice in 20 years!,"I recall fondly those days as 10 year old eating Twizzlers black licorice with my grandmother until they changed the recipe, removing molasses. It became too disgusting for words. It was the only time in my tween years that I wrote to a company to complain. Y&S Candies sent me back a letter saying that molasses had become too expensive and was no longer being used in the licorice, but they included coupons for spaghetti sauce as an appeasement. Inexplicable. In any case, my licorice consumption declined. A few years later, I developed a horrid gluten intolerance, and my licorice days were over for good.<br /><br />Or so I thought.<br /><br />After nearly 20 years without licorice (OK! I admit I would steal an occasional nibble...), I was shocked, SHOCKED to find Candy Tree Gluten-free licorice, and best of all, it's pretty darn tasty! I blame Candy Tree for restarting my sugar addiction, but I just can't stop eating it. I highly recommend this product. I like the licorice twists the best, but the ropes are good, too. Give it a shot!! And thank you, Candy Tree, for giving me something I truly missed."
07	62277,B000CQG8KS,A2IPHGXIAYZNJK,1/8/07,0,0,5,Our morning wake up,My wife and I enjoy this black tea with Stash Chai Spice Green as our drink at breakfast.  We add Splenda and skim milk to start our day right.
07	62278,B000CQG8KS,A1AJ5JVIO3PD25,1/8/07,0,0,5,This tea is tops.,This is one of my favorite teas.  The double dose of Bergamot gives this Earl Grey a wonderful flavor.  You can't beat the price in the groceriey stores.
07	40260,B00086ICFG,A173MY87YFS5KJ,1/10/07,5,5,5,"Cookie ""Duster""","I had a difficult time finding the sanding sugar.  There are no stores in my area that carry it.  I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  The store I bought it from was quick to deliver and I was very pleased with the price of the product.  I received a generous amount and was able to ""dust"" all my sugar cookies! Thank you!"
07	42710,B001ELLAEY,A1A3H22VVZYUKW,8/13/07,1,3,1,alternative sweetner,"I was disappointed in this product, as I had read and heard that this was an excellent sweetner, and it only took a small amount.  NOT TRUE!  I had a 8 ounce glass of tea, and added two ""straws"" of Nectar, and you couldn't even tell anything had been added.  Expensive if  you had to use a whole pack to slightly sweeten anything."
07	25547,B000J23YP2,A1DD0PU3N3T3WM,10/19/07,5,5,5,Delicious,"I had these candies at the Ethos Greek restaurant in NYC.  I grabbed one from a candy bowl and walked out, thinking it would be a mint.  But when I popped it in, the intense anise flavor bursting throughout my mouth, I immediately wanted to turn around and grab a handful.  They're absolutely delicious, they cleanse your palette, and make your breath smell like sweet licorice.  Don't let their small size fool you, they pack a punch."
07	42709,B001ELLAEY,A28ZV2FB9OAFVJ,10/19/07,0,0,3,Agave Nectar,It's great to have agave in a portable format.  But is is difficult to open.  The directions say to pinch to open.  They are not so easy to pinch.  I have found if you bend the tube about 1 inch above the end then pinch the end it helps.  But the agave often gets on your fingers.
07	12827,B000MSAZ9G,A3AYVB9Y16I941,6/8/07,0,0,3,gifted,gave it to a friend as a gift and she enjoyed using it in her baking

07	4907,B0009JMW1C,A2HYS4LMBN8E0M,3/14/07,4,4,5,Mucus drainage!!!,I'm very happy with this-- drains my ears and sinuses quite effectively.  Works better for me than guaifenisen.
07	80967,B000HX8AC0,A4NRCEYPP2ZL5,5/24/07,2,8,1,A Big Bag of Grass,"I have tried several of the premix bases for dog food. My dog is on a raw diet. When this bag of premix arrived, I was terribly disappointed. It was like receiving a bag of mulched grass. There was very little fruits or vegetables as claimed on the label. It smells like a bag of fresh cut hay. From the look and smell, it's almost all alfalfa. There are other premixed bases available that are much better. I am mixing it with other mixes to make it more appealing to my dog."

07	35967,B0001IG49W,A14TNUCARGZE0T,9/8/07,2,2,5,Love Grapefruit!,I love this marmalade from the first time I purchased it at a close-out store.  I loved it so much I went back to purchase every jar they had only to find they had no more.  I went on line in search for it and was thrilled to find Amazon as a source.
07	46820,B001J78U6O,A3R6PI47EF3F83,2/11/07,9,9,5,my my my,"I bought these chocolates as a birthday gift for my wife. They came super fast, well packed in a custom styrofoam shipping carton.<br /><br />I'm not a big chocolate fan but I know quality. These are rich and smooth and deeply satisfying. I can imagine that a true chocolate lover would really love them!"
07	34459,B008FHUDW0,A3D7MXGCU7HCYE,12/28/07,9,10,5,Great Coffee!,I completely agree with the previous review - this is outstanding coffee.  I too have tried a lot of the K-Cup varieties and have found this one to be the best.  It has a wonderfully smooth flavor.  It really is a superior cup of coffee!
07	46821,B001J78U6O,AXYOK5FU1DOBZ,3/3/07,8,9,5,Leonidas is superb,Leonidas dark chocolate is sensational. To enjoy its full flavor let the segment melt on your tongue. Don't chew.
07	53182,B002UUJ590,A2FHZ90AAIYOUZ,12/13/07,2,2,5,Exactly as described,Product is exactly as described and the packaging looks/feels quality.  Haven't opened it or tasted the jellybeans as it is a gift. It was packed for shipping well and arrived in 3 days on the cheapest shipping method.
07	73626,B000EPOC2S,A1I34N9LFOSCX7,10/23/07,1,1,5,fantastic!,i have to agree that these are delicious tasty cookies.  i'm not a vegan & i don't have a problem eating gluten. i just like yummy cookies & these cookies are yummy!
07	6227,B001EO776Q,A1UY7FXQ0G5BXC,11/25/07,0,0,4,Good stuff,"Nice body and full roasted flavor at a reasonable price for a organic ""fair trade"".  I'd buy the discounted pack again, but full price cost it too much to overcome my desire for an affordable coffee."
07	53509,B006W5WGFE,AKVMBYV9ZDGS8,10/3/07,3,22,1,Wrong item,"When I ordered this item I was sent the Special K Protein Meal Bars, rather than Snack bars.  I reported this to Amazon, and they told me that they would ship the correct item.  However, the new package again contained only Meal Bars.  The description/title of this item must be incorrect.  Do not order this item if you are looking for the Snack Bars."
07	62316,B000CQG8KS,A2ANIWVAFY5554,3/7/07,8,9,5,Best Chai Tea you can buy,"I love tea, and recently have become a fan of Chai tea. But after trying all the other brands including the one at Starbucks, I have concluded that this particular tea is the best. So much, in fact, that I bought 12 boxes in bulk through Amazon."
07	4909,B0009JMW1C,A380HU2H8OY9ID,1/2/07,4,5,5,Sinus Help,"I found this tea by accident but it worked so well that i later ordered it,<br /><br />after not being able to find it again.  It really helps open nasal passages.<br /><br />Since starting to use it whenever I have bad nasal congestion, I have not<br /><br />had a sinus infection.  Everyone is different, but it sure worked for me."
07	5014,B000HDKZDC,ADLW3LV9MZRUY,11/20/07,4,4,5,Yummy,"These are really excellent breakfast bars. Note to the previous reviewer: the Nutrigrain bars, last I checked, had artificial color in them. These don't. They also taste very good. This is our third order through Amazon (great price) and my daughter misses them when we're out."
07	62329,B000CQG8KS,A2IHN52PS0V022,1/5/07,1,3,3,Nothing Special,"Good Earl Grey Tea but nothing about it was special. The ""double bergamot"" went unoticed."
07	524,B000G6RYNE,A27C44BIRQH3QW,7/27/07,13,15,5,The Best Chips...PERIOD!,"You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best."
07	38750,B000EGZ9AQ,A2PFMNK8C2R2DX,12/2/07,1,4,3,Jasmati white rice,The white Jasmati rice is not as aromatic or flavorful as the white Basmati rice. Don't know why - suppose because one is grown in rice paddys overseas and the Jasmati Organic is grown in American soil and conditions?<br />The brown Jasmati rice is great - ! - more flavorful and smell is wonderful.
07	64542,B000G82L62,A1C4QE2JODDX6I,4/1/07,35,36,5,My favorite so far!,"I'm really a white rice kinda person - raised on it, like it.  As my tastes matured I learned how much more flavor there is to be had -- basmati, jasmine...in white rice, jasmine is my favorite.  I started trying to eat better several years ago, but never truly learned to appreciate brown rice.  Instead, I ended up mostly cutting rice from my diet.  Now that I have found Lundberg Wild Blend, rice is back in the lineup.  I look forward to the nights when this is one of the sides.  It has a nutty taste, yes, but also a bit of sweetness.  We love it!"
07	62330,B000CQG8KS,A18YQUNRMYGT3X,3/7/07,2,5,3,Why Different Packaging?,"Oddly, the tea bag wrappers are paper instead of the usual foil used for the very same Stash tea when purchased in the supermarket.  We assume that this will have a negative bearing on tea leaf freshness."
07	62332,B000CQG8KS,A3O97165H0JQXN,5/12/07,0,2,5,Stash Tea,The tea is Premium quality as stated on the box.  I wish Amazon was carrying larger packages than the Box of 20 Tea Bags.
07	53183,B002UUJ590,A2GLMHYUFE9SIT,5/31/07,2,2,5,A Fun Twist,"This Jelly Belly box is a fun twist on the theme, and makes a great gift.  My father enjoyed following ""recipes"" on the back to make new flavors (e.g. blueberry + butter = blueberry muffin). Since each flavor is sorted into its own compartment, it's easy to figure out which you like the most.  This is not a large volume of beans, but it's a well designed package."
07	5628,B000EUJLHE,A33PVCHCQ2BTN0,3/1/07,8,8,5,Fabulous!,"I love Wasa Crisp 'n Light crackers! As their name suggests, they do have a very light and crisp texture.  They are still strong enough to support hummus or other spreads you may like to use.  However, they are also very delicious by themselves.  Sometimes you just want something to crunch without wasting a lot of calories on chips or other fattening foods, and a stick of celery isn't what you had in mind.  I keep these in the pantry all the time. They are low sodium and contain just 20 calories per cracker."
07	42545,B001EQ5PKE,A2U559EYMXTBOB,7/3/07,12,12,5,Best sugar alternative!,"My husband and I switched to Stevia in place of sugar and other artifical sweeteners.<br /><br />The product is completely safe (you can web search for many studies) and now we saw on the news that Coca Cola is going to try it as an alternate sweetener!  It is used outside the United States normally!<br /><br />We tried many Stevias but this one tastes great and is economical!  We are Southerners and drink lots of ice tea and just a teaspoon sweetens a whole gallon of tea!  It melts easy and stores great! You use so little, the jar lasts a long time!<br /><br />Some say even this product tastes bitter.  That is because you are over doing the amount!  Back off with less and you will find the taste like sugar (and not artifical tasting like the artifical sweeteners).<br /><br />My husband was showing pre-diabetic tendencies and he only drinks Stevia for sweetener now.  He is a very ""picky"" eater and he loves the taste!<br /><br />We would ""cry"" if they stopped making this!"
07	30493,B000GFYRI0,A2BB4DGBRVGKWW,4/4/07,1,2,5,My favorite so far,"I have been looking for a cheaper way to get good chai than continuing to pay several dollars at a coffee shop.<br /><br />Most brands I have tried, including more expensive stuff, either smell funny or have a single spice that is too strong and stands out.  Bigelow's chai doesn't have any harsh standouts, and results in the unique even taste I liked about the expensive coffee shop tea.  On top of being my favorite strictly by taste, it's also one of the cheapest brands on the shelf.<br /><br />Two handy features:<br /><br /> - Each bag is inside its own envelope.  It's nice to be able to transport one or two bags without having to touch them directly with dirty hands.  Other brands leave the individal bags naked and have a nice sealed liner in the box, which is really handy if you plan on wandering around with an ENTIRE BOX OF TEA.<br /><br /> - Each bag has a dipping string/tab attached to remove the bag from your cup.  It's 2007 and some teabag manufacturers still won't spot us a 2"" piece of thread."
07	50300,B000FBQ50I,A1SB8CXAUIKT8X,10/25/07,3,6,2,Rather Bland,"I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'."

It has a very oily taste to it. I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again."
07	62358,B000CQG8KS,A2G1EDE6KZQ4ZA,1/17/07,2,2,5,Great Tea at a Nice Price,"This tea has an excellent flavor that I never get sick of.  I usually have one every morning at work.  Its earl grey, which is strong, so make sure you like that type of tea.  Before finding this here on Amazon, I used to purchase this exact brand/flavor at Jewel for around $6 each 20ct box... much better deal here."

The product itself gets 20 stars because my Beagles literally dance for them... but the pricing gets a big BOO!  I always shop Amazon because I know I can get terrific prices, that's why I was surprised."

I add a little shredded cheddar cheese sometimes.  They make a great snack for after school and are superb as a side-dish or as the main course. They go great with fruit, salads, vegetables, and even dinner rolls.  Try 'em!  Can't beat the price either."

However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />""Feullitees Doree,"" which can be bought on in France."

I have tasted many gummy bears over the years and none of them are as good as Haribo. I was introduced to Haribo during middle school/high school, by my German teacher. Now I'm addicted to them (and German candy in general). Haribo gummy bears are chewy but not sticky, so they don't leave sticky residue on your fingers. They're sweet but not too sweet, and the fruit flavors actually taste like the fruit they're supposed to taste like.<br /><br />A note on locating them - I find it odd that everyone seems to have trouble finding these in the United States. I don't know about the other states, but they're everywhere, here in Massachusetts. You can get them at any convenience store or Walgreens/CVS/whatever.<br /><br />And I might as well put my years of German classes to good use - the product description says that Haribo's ""catch phrase"" (Haribo macht Kinder froh / und Erwachsene ebenso) translates to: ""Kids and grown-ups love it so / the happy world of Haribo."" Actually, it translates to, literally: ""Haribo makes children happy / and adults as well."""

I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."

This is my favorite, good taste and texture, but tends to get very hard if a bit stale.  Nevertheless, I would recommend, especially for someone gluten-free, in which case there aren't enough options."
07	28824,B000FFVYF0,A3GBQIC33A89DY,9/3/07,1,1,5,Very Tasty,"This gluten-free bar is much better than most - a rich combination of just what it says - fruit and nuts.  However, the unit description is incorrect.  It is not 8 boxes but one box of eight bars."

My only objection is that they're kinda smelly to carry around in your pockets, as I usually do, altho the dogs consider the scent a very tantalizing aroma!"
07	80353,B0002XAG36,AHMXKDXYD62PG,8/13/07,1,1,5,My dog loves them,"Our GSD loves the treats.  They have never upset her stomach at all and she takes them down with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />It's quite true that they smell like fish food, but I normally don't carry them around in my pocket on account of them being pretty brittle if you were to have them bounce around in a pocket or treat bag.<br /><br />The fact that they are loved by our dog and are a healthy snack makes it a win-win for us.  I'd definitely purchase these in the future."

If you're looking for the ""chai"" sold at gas stations, this is not it.  Be sue to add cream and sweetener for an autheic chai flavor.  To make this vanilla chai, just add vanilla creamer.  Tastes awesome."

I have in the past had a difficult time finding it in any of the grocercy stores I shop at, and when I do the price is at least a dollar a box more than here.<br /><br />If you like a flavorful tea, you should like this one.  In my hom you can't go wrong with this one."

07	62406,B000CQG8KS,AGV2SUHV9P47T,3/28/07,3,4,5,Steeping - the longer the better,"This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6"">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"

When I read the list of ingedients on the package for the treats, I was stoked.  These crunchy little morsels are packed with nutrients and small enough to use for training without having to break them.<br /><br />The only downside is the smell... but they *are smoked salmon treats after all.  An added bonus is that they seem to digest well (unlike cheese and some other lamb-based treats I've tried)."
07	80348,B0002XAG36,A36IMDTS7GO1EM,5/27/07,2,2,2,Was not impressed,"I was disappointed in this product especially considering how exceptional the Salmon Oil they make is.<br /><br />This did not pass the 11 rescue dog test! They just turned up their noses. So did the other dogs here. Very tiny tidbits, as well.Buy an extra bottle of the Grizzly Salmon oil instead."

I make these muffins  by substituting milk for the water and add 2 mashed bananas and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I've tried adding pineapple but didn't like it as much as my version of banana muffins.  My daughter's boyfriend loves these muffins and has no idea that they are made from rice flour.  Another great Namaste item to try is the Spice Cake.  Just add some grated carrots, pineapple, coconut, walnuts and raisins and you've got a kick-butt Carrot Cake.  Thanks to Namaste for the wonderful products......I'm hooked!"

07	42463,B00018CX60,A1LZHXGEQE8NF7,1/8/07,6,6,5,Loved It,Loved this pie filling.  After moving from Wisconsin to North Carolina so many years ago Rhubarb is one of the things the family missed.  It is very hard to find and very expensive when you do find it.  This made pie making over the holidays so easy.  Will order more to stock up.
07	17573,B0000GH6UQ,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,11/2/07,10,12,5,Mexican is quite good,"Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w/ European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews."

I enjoy a rich chocolate taste, so if you prefer a watered down milk chocolate effect, keep on looking. It is important to not overbake them so that they are still fudgy in the middle. They taste better than any other mix I have ever tried."

It will not give you the sugar plunge you get from sugary products.  If you are using this product in beverages please realize that it is not going to give you that same sugary, syrupy flavor that some people are used to from regular sugar or substitutes.  It is a subtle sweetness.<br /><br />I have served this product to friends, and those who are used to a sugary taste in their tea didn't care for it as much as those friends who don't use a lot of sugar.  It really depends on what you are used to.  I have no complaints about this product.<br /><br />Agave is also better for people who have diabetes, as it does not spike blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Don't pass up on trying this great alternative to sugar.  It is worth letting your tastebuds adapt to the subtleness.  It is also great for baking.  Also, this is now labeled as organic, so another reason to try it."
07	528,B000G6RYNE,A2L9028WTVFL1I,3/23/07,11,14,5,Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!,"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"

With great anticipation, I received the sweets. From the first taste, I began remembering my Grandmother saving a box of these for those special occassions. Treats often associated with Kings, Queens, and heads of states, they have a somewhat different taste than most western confectionary. Try a box and see for yourself."
07	65095,B000EM8UFG,A58N07M0ZCYMB,1/27/07,2,3,5,Excellent Fruit Tea,"I purchased this in a B&M store but wanted to add a review on amazon for this tea.  It's excellent.  Wonderful tea flavor, great black tea flavor, it's not overly fruity or very sweet, it has just the right balance of a fruit/black tea.  The tea pyramids never lose their shape.  It's great iced.  It has real pieces of fruit and big tea leaves inside the pyramids.  Definitely one of the best teas I've ever drank (but the very the best teas are very expensive hand-picked leaves ordered from specialist tea websites and brewed by spoon-full.)"
07	28528,B000E3XCGC,A6SHOGP56RZLA,7/22/07,0,0,4,Good stuff,"For some reason it is hard to find the Uncle Ben's Original.  This is just as good, but a bit different in flavor, and reasonably priced.  Just wish the packaged rice makers would lay off the insane amount of salt.  I only used packed rice boxes if I am in a real hurry.  Usually make my own, much less expensive.<br />The secret to making your own rice like this is plenty of dried parsely and garlic.  Heck of allot cheaper and no hypertension salt."
07	62468,B000FBL8FU,A2RRXEND0UBV3D,11/26/07,6,7,5,Tasty & Filling -- A Rarity for Gluten-Free!,"Gorilla Munch has been a real life-saver for me.  Having celiac disease, I have gotten used to cereals that taste and feel like soggy cardboard.  Gorilla Munch is extra crunchy, which in and of itself is like a treat, and it keeps its flavor even when milk is added, which almost never happens with gluten-free cereals.  It's more affordably priced than the other gluten-free cereals on the market and is very filling, at least for me.  I usually mix in a teaspoon of FiberSure to help make it a little more nutritional, and sometimes I add fresh fruit, which goes very well with it.  For those who do not like the crunchiness of Gorilla Munch, I've found that using unsweetened almond milk rather than cow's milk seems to soften it up almost instantly, for some reason.<br /><br />I take issue with the idea that Gorilla Munch is nothing but junk being targeted at children.  This cereal is marketed to children who cannot eat gluten, meaning they're mostly children who are used to food tasting terrible (those with celiac disease or wheat allergies) and children who are /positively/ stimulated by bright colors and designs (those with autism).  They are already on strict diets which require that they watch their nutrient intake, so having one mostly fluff product is not going to hurt them.  Children on gluten-free diets aren't exactly the ones you worry about eating doughnuts and cookies every day, and with all of the bland, soggy food we're stuck with, they deserve a treat once in a while.  And with almost no other brand making fun-looking gluten-free items geared at children, it's good to have at least /something/ to look at, especially something that's educational.<br /><br />Additionally, EnviroKidz is a great company to support.  They spread awareness about important environmental and animal rights issues through their products, they use only environment-friendly organic products, and they give 1% of their proceeds to related causes.  When I have called their customer service line in the past, they have been exceptionally helpful, once even giving me a full refund for a product that was only slightly damaged.  I would much rather give them my money than some of the other lines out there.<br /><br />In brief, Gorilla Munch is a great cereal that helps put some life back into a gluten-free diet.  It's nice to be able to eat a bowl of cereal again and not have to be reminded of my special diet and how restrictive it can be.  Thank you, Gorilla Munch!"
07	62469,B000FBL8FU,AWGDEE5IRM2Z3,1/3/07,6,7,5,Nice gluten-free choice,"I've used it successfully as a snack for my gluten allergic son.  It's a good tasting cereal.

07	30506,B001EQ59W8,A1G6EEN6130R1E,11/4/07,2,2,5,Delicious!,This stuff is delicious!  We love it.  The candies are soft and have a real rose flavor.  There is a lot of powdered sugar on them but it is easily dusted off if it's too much for your taste.

07	53203,B002UUJ590,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,10/21/07,3,6,3,Jelly Bellies don't knock my socks off,The best thing about jelly bellies is that they seem to be using higher quality ingredients than other American manufacturers but I remember when jelly beans didn't have to be gourmet to taste good.  I bought a 7 oz. bag of 30 flavors from Target and I find that bag to be too much for me but I would have bought the full 50 flavor assortment if Target had sold it because of the organization and identification of flavors.  I wasn't supposed to get cantaloup in my 30 flavor bag but I did get one and that flavor was so much better than tangerine.  I also liked the root beer.  The popcorn flavor was interestingly reminiscent of artificially fragrant movie theatre popcorn.  The jelly belly flavors are interesting but I prefer the lightly flavored pastel jelly beans available during Easter.  I believe they are manufacturered by Brachs.  They are gentler tasting than jelly bellies.

We do eat fruit and yogurt, but sometimes it is just nice to be able to eat ""normal"" food.  For us cereal, bread, and pizza are missed the most on our gluten free diet.  Now that envirokidz has so many options for the days we crave carbs and sweetness all is well in the cereal department.  This is similar to peanut butter panda puffs without the peanut butter taste.  Reminds me of captain crunch in its flavor."

They ended up sending me a big box of their WellBars that have Yogurt, Apples, and Bananas in them. Totally vegetarian, oven baked with lots of vitamins! I'm sure you have read one of my other reviews about Old Mother Hubbard, they make outstanding healthy treats. Turns out that WellNess is owned by Old Mother Hubbard. Who knew? As usual Dad ran me though a barrage of tests to see how much I really wanted the treat. Let's just say I had to work very hard. Those silly ""sit ups"" that little dogs do, roll over, sit, stay, down, etc, just to have him put the treats in my Everlasting Treat Ball! I made short work of it and devoured my new delicious and healthy treats. The only thing I'm a little disappointed about is I found out that they have WellBites that are soft treats. They even have one that's Lamb and Salmon flavored... Those are two of my favorite things in the world. Now I have to talk Dad into buying them for me...<br /><br />Conclusion: Outstanding healthy dog treats! A must buy for a healthy pup."

I might try the cheaper version of the organic white tea next with the usual teabag crumbs since this is not whole leaf anyways."

I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.

I made the dough for the crust from a recipe from the Pie and Pastry Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum. I used the cream cheese based pastry for a two crust 9 inch pie. I prebaked the shell for 15 minutes at 425F. Then I added the rhubarb pie filling. I put a few tabs of butter on top. I then made a lattice with the leftover dough. Then I baked it for half an hour at 390F. I did not have to add anything to the pie filling. It tasted delicious as is. The result was a very tasty and easy to make rhubarb pie. It will certainly be comforting to eat rhubarb pie during these cold winter nights."

Finally I went to the fod store & saw this on the shelf.  Seeing how I am crazy for anything mint, i thought I'd give this a shot.  First cup I made was absolutely wonderful!!<br /><br />This tea has a very light taste at first sip & a cool, lingering peppermint taste at the end.  It's perfect any time of year, hot or cold, alone or with dessert (even a main course!).<br /><br />If you like mint, you'll love this!  Most mint tea's I've tried inthe past were disappointing, I couldn't even taste the mint & felt it was a waste of my money, & I never even finished the first cup.

I have tried hundreds of brands and the quality just does not compare to Guayaki. I really like how they include stems with leaf. Mate is meant to be drunk this way and the stems add a significant amount of theophylline and theobromine and also add to the sweet and nutty flavor notes not found in other Mate's. I also appreciate that Guayaki uses only shade grown Mate - as it is meant to be. Sun grown mate lacks body and benefits.<br /><br />I really like the companies sustainable business model. The company is true blue when it comes to their mission. Fairly traded products that allow the indigenous people to receive a fair wage for their work. Guayaki's reforestation efforts should be applauded.<br /><br />Thank you for making such a fine product.

The cats like it.  It is more expensive than Science Diet, but not prohibitively so.  Note:  the Milwaukee newspaper advises the canned Fromm is made in China.

07	42461,B00018CX60,A36GEDLB5A5MJ,7/5/07,8,8,3,Better than no rhubarb pie,"I was very hopeful about this pie filling, since I love rhubarb and can't get it since moving to the South (not unless I pay through the nose).  However, I've only opened one of the two jars I bought, so far, and that jar WAS a generous amount for filling an 8 or 9-inch pie, but had what I consider to be much too thick a consistency (possibly as a result of all the sugar and other sweeteners necessary for the preserving process? I don't know).<br /><br />In addition, I may've simply gotten one 'bad' jar, but the flavor seemed 'off' -- almost on the edge of fermentation.  I 'cut' the jar of pie filling with a pound of fresh strawberries and turned it into a decent-ish 10-inch strawberry-rhubarb pie, but it still doesn't taste quite right to me, and there's still that slight hint of fermentation.  I can eat it, but I'm not in any hurry to finish it off.<br /><br />Perhaps my expectations were unreasonable, since I've never had a canned rhubarb pie filling before (not even home-canned), but always used fresh or home-frozen rhubarb, going easy on the sugar in the recipe to preserve that mouth-watering tartness.  Whenever I've had access to lots of rhubarb, I prefer it straight, no strawberries or blueberries or raspberries mixed in (though those are all good combinations).<br /><br />Honestly, I'm beginning to think it might be worthwhile to pay over $4 a pound for a bit of fresh rhubarb in the store, which I can cut with the much-cheaper strawberries to make a semi-rhubarb pie.  But that's just my taste, and as I said, I might've simply gotten a 'bad batch'."

07	73608,B000EPOC2S,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,10/27/07,6,6,4,Mmm Good - a review of Mi-Del's Ginger Snaps,"I am the sort of mom who likes to bake my own cookies because 1) it's fun, and 2) I like to know what goes into them.  However, when that is not practical I buy these ginger snap cookies.<br /><br />I don't mind giving them to my family because they are mostly organic (70%) and they don't contain hydrogenated oils nor corn syrup.  In addition, they contain iron - from the molasses - which is  something you don't often find in a snack.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A superior product in my opinion.  The whole family loves them.  Even my extremely picky son.  The flavor is zingy with a definite bite and each cookie is only 26 calories.  One of the few store-bought treats that I have no problem handing out to the children.<br /><br />Pam T~"

Its loose tea packages are convenient to use and well-packaged for maintaining freshness during storage, shipment, and in the home, even after being opened.  All in all, a very superior product."
07	20569,B000PEPKFQ,ACH1HJAM7UIZR,7/29/07,16,18,3,"Decent taste, but some definite drawbacks.","Amazon doesn't list the ingredients of this, but it does contain lots of high fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup.  Corn syrup, especially the high fructose variety, is quite bad for you.  It's cheap for manufacturers, that's partly why they use it.  I'm disappointed in Heinz about his.  Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.<br /><br />Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.  This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no-no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE-inhibitor family especially).<br /><br />I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this.  Maybe I tried, I forget.  At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label:<br />""INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING.  * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP""<br /><br />Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order.  It came as loose bottles in a box.  Also, there was a barcode/description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle.  This was probably for internal Amazon purposes.  I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful."

However, the VitaSpelt pasta is very much like the wheat pasta, in the opinion of my kids.  They eat it up and ask for more.  Personally, I also prefer the VitaSpelt products when eating gluten free pasta.  Both the texture and flavor are what one would anticipate and prefer if they are yet unaccustomed to the gluten free diet."

I would also recommend purchasing the 11-ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.<br /><br />I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don't like the burnt taste.  Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste.  Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks Starbucks is far, far overrated (bitter, burnt)."

07	43827,B001EQ5JLE,A34EGKN2KDX08N,10/21/07,88,95,5,Briton's #1 Tea - PG Tips,"The folks in the United Kingdom drink more PG Tips tea than any other brand, and perhaps after you try it; it will be your #1 choice, too! (By the way, the folks in Ireland drink more tea per person than in any other country.)<br /><br />PG Tips Tea and PG Tips Special Blend Tea is our home's standard tea. There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Amazon will do so soon.<br /><br />In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name ""Pre-Gest-Tee"" suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten, but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of ""PG"" - and the company added ""tips"" (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant, the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea).<br /><br />Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud), which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas. PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused. Additionally, in my opinion, PG Tips blends only two blends, rather than blending a wide assortment, thus becoming really good at what they do.<br /><br />Here at Amazon PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two, and even less expensive in the higher volumes. PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too, and that's good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea. Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea, and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water), while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water).<br /><br />A very good question to ponder is ""Why this is?""<br /><br />Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one's health, and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea), especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee.<br /><br />When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa, and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus, I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price!"

It can also be the main ingredient for a meal that has pasta with sauce as part of a main course dish. The pasta remains quite fresh until any expiration date that is printed on the box; and each box contains enough ziti for eight servings.<br /><br />The pasta is so easy to cook: just boil a pot of water; pour in the amount of the ziti that you need; and stir for about 10 minutes. If you like your pasta a bit firm then cook it for about 8 minutes--watch it and take a taste test of just one piece of pasta if you have any doubts. Some people add a little salt while the pasta cooks; I personally don't add salt. I never noticed any difference between salted and unsalted because the small amount of salt that you're supposed to add makes no big difference.<br /><br />The pasta is very low in fat; and it contains no trans-fats--thank goodness! This pasta contains no cholesterol and no sodium, either. That's very good health news. It does contain carbohydrates as you may have suspected; but a single serving still keeps those carbs low at only 14% of the daily allowance of carbs. Great!<br /><br />Ronzoni states on the front of the box that this macaroni pasta is enriched; I assume they are referring to the Iron, Niacin and Riboflavin in the pasta. The pasta has 7 grams of protein per serving as well. In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />There are some caveats, however: this product contains wheat and it is made in a facility that uses eggs. If this is a concern for you please consult your doctor or nutritional expert.<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem. Just call Ronzoni using their toll free number or visit their website.<br /><br />Overall, this ziti by Ronzoni is the best out there! It's affordable; easy to cook and serve; and it doesn't pose any major health risks to the vast majority of people. I highly recommend this fine pasta."

There's a lot of butter taste in these cookies and they're not overly sweet. Just right! I'll be buying again when the 12 pack runs out. Amazon please make sure you keep these in stock on a continuing basis!
